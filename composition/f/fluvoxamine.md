# Fluvoxamine
### Generic Name
Fluvoxamine

### Usage

Fluvoxamine is primarily used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).  It helps reduce the severity of obsessions (recurring unwanted thoughts, images, or urges) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed to reduce anxiety caused by obsessions).  While its primary FDA-approved indication is for OCD, fluvoxamine is also used off-label for several other conditions, including:

* **Social Anxiety Disorder:**  Fluvoxamine can help alleviate the intense fear and anxiety associated with social situations.
* **Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):**  It may be used to manage some of the symptoms of PTSD, such as nightmares, flashbacks, and avoidance behaviors.  However, it's crucial to understand that it's not a first-line treatment for PTSD.
* **Panic Disorder:** Fluvoxamine can help reduce the frequency and severity of panic attacks.
* **Social Phobia:** Similar to social anxiety disorder, it can help manage the fear and anxiety related to social situations.
* **Major Depressive Disorder:** Although less common, it may be used as an adjunct or alternative in certain cases of depression.

It's important to note that off-label uses mean the drug hasn't undergone the same rigorous testing for these conditions as it has for OCD.  Always discuss the appropriateness of fluvoxamine for any condition with your doctor.


### Dosage

Fluvoxamine dosage varies depending on the condition being treated, the individual's response, and other factors.  It comes in immediate-release and extended-release formulations.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage instructions precisely.  The following information is for general understanding and should not replace professional medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **OCD:**  Immediate-release: Typically starts at 50 mg daily at bedtime, increasing gradually as tolerated to 100-300 mg/day, maximum 300 mg/day. Extended-release: Usually starts at 100 mg daily at bedtime, with gradual increases to 100-300 mg/day, maximum 300 mg/day.  Higher doses are often divided into two administrations.
* **Off-label uses (Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, PTSD, Social Phobia, Major Depressive Disorder):** Dosage is typically similar to that of OCD, starting at lower doses and gradually increasing under medical supervision.

**Children and Adolescents:**

Fluvoxamine use in children is primarily for OCD, and dosage is determined by age, weight, and response, always under the close supervision of a physician.  Lower starting doses are used, typically 25 mg/day, with gradual increases.  The maximum dose can vary but usually does not exceed 300mg/day.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with hepatic (liver) impairment. Renal (kidney) impairment may not require dosage changes, but this should be determined by a physician.

### How it Works

Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).  Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (chemical messenger) in the brain that plays a significant role in mood, sleep, and other functions.  Fluvoxamine works by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain. By blocking the reuptake of serotonin, it allows more serotonin to remain in the synaptic cleft (the space between nerve cells), thus enhancing its effects. This increase in serotonin activity is believed to help alleviate the symptoms of OCD and other conditions it's used to treat.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fluvoxamine should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity to it or its components.  It should not be used concurrently with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or within at least 14 days of discontinuing MAOI treatment.  Specific other drug interactions exist; consult your doctor or pharmacist for detailed information.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Fluvoxamine can interact with numerous other medications, including some antidepressants, anticoagulants, and others.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Fluvoxamine is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its effects on the fetus are not fully known.  The risks and benefits should be carefully considered before using it during pregnancy.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so the potential effects on a nursing infant should be weighed against the benefits of the mother's treatment.
* **Children and Adolescents:**  Increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior has been observed in young adults taking antidepressants. Close monitoring is essential.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are often needed for those with liver problems.
* **Sudden Discontinuation:**  Abruptly stopping fluvoxamine can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always taper off the medication gradually under your doctor's guidance.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking fluvoxamine?**  A: It's best to avoid alcohol or limit its consumption significantly while taking fluvoxamine, as it can increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The time it takes for fluvoxamine to become effective varies.  Some individuals may experience improvements within a few weeks, while others may require several weeks or longer.
* **Q: How should I store fluvoxamine?** A: Store it as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.
* **Q: Can I stop taking fluvoxamine suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms. Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.  A gradual tapering is recommended.
