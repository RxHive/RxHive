# Flupenthixol
### Generic Name
Flupenthixol

### Usage
Flupenthixol is a thioxanthene antipsychotic medication primarily used for the long-term management (maintenance therapy) of chronic schizophrenia in patients whose symptoms are not characterized by significant excitement, agitation, or hyperactivity.  It's important to note that flupenthixol is not typically a first-line treatment for acute episodes of schizophrenia.  Its effectiveness lies in preventing relapse in individuals already stabilized on an antipsychotic medication.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the route of administration (oral or intramuscular injection) and the patient's individual response and tolerance.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's precise instructions.

**Oral:**

* **Initial Dose:**  Typically starts low, often at 1 mg three times daily (TID).
* **Dose Adjustment:** The dose may be gradually increased by 1 mg every 2-3 days, depending on individual tolerance and response.
* **Maintenance Dose:** Usually ranges from 3-6 mg/day in divided doses.  Higher doses (up to 12 mg/day) have been used in some cases but are less common.

**Intramuscular (IM injection - Flupenthixol decanoate, a long-acting injectable form):**

* **Initial Dose (for patients new to depot antipsychotics):** A test dose of 5-20 mg is usually administered.  Lower doses (5mg) are recommended for elderly, frail, cachectic patients, or those predisposed to extrapyramidal side effects. Close monitoring for therapeutic response and side effects is crucial for the next 5-10 days. Oral medication may be tapered down during this period.
* **Initial Dose (for patients already on depot antipsychotics):** 20-40 mg may be administered.
* **Maintenance Dose:**  Typically 20-40 mg every 2-3 weeks.  The dose is highly individualized and adjusted based on the patient's response, usually in increments of â‰¤20 mg. Doses above 80 mg are uncommon.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of flupenthixol in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

Flupenthixol, like other antipsychotics, can cause various side effects.  The severity and frequency vary from person to person.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Blurred vision
* Weight changes

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):**  These include muscle rigidity, tremors, restlessness (akathisia), involuntary muscle movements (dystonia), and in rare cases, tardive dyskinesia (irreversible movement disorder).
* **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):**  A rare but life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
* **Orthostatic hypotension:** A sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing.
* **Prolonged QT interval:**  This can lead to potentially fatal heart rhythm abnormalities.
* **Blood disorders:**  Such as agranulocytosis (severe reduction in white blood cells)


**If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Flupenthixol is a dopamine receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain that plays a significant role in various functions, including movement, mood, and cognition.  In schizophrenia, an imbalance in dopamine levels is thought to contribute to the symptoms. By blocking dopamine receptors, flupenthixol helps to reduce these symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Flupenthixol is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to flupenthixol, thioxanthenes, or any components of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** Flupenthixol interacts with many medications.  It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements, you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Flupenthixol is a Category C pregnancy medication (potential risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out).  It's crucial to discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using it during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. The drug can also affect fertility.
* **Elderly Patients:** Use caution in elderly patients, particularly those with cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or dementia.
* **Patients with Liver or Kidney Impairment:**  Use caution in patients with liver or kidney problems.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking flupenthixol suddenly?**  A: No, abrupt discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping or changing your dosage.

* **Q: How should I store flupenthixol?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist, usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose.

* **Q: Is flupenthixol addictive?**  A: Flupenthixol is not considered an addictive substance in the same way as opioids, but tolerance can develop, requiring dose adjustments under a physician's supervision.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking flupenthixol?** A: Combining alcohol with flupenthixol can increase drowsiness and other side effects. It is best to avoid alcohol or limit its consumption significantly.
