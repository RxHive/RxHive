# Fluconazole + Ivermectin

There is **no approved combination drug** containing fluconazole and ivermectin.  While both drugs are used to treat infections, they are used for different types of infections and are not typically prescribed together.  Combining them is not supported by scientific evidence and could be dangerous.

Therefore, providing details in the requested format for a "generic Fluconazole + Ivermectin" is impossible as such a medication does not exist.  It's crucial to only take medications prescribed by a doctor and to avoid self-medicating with combinations of drugs not approved for use together.  Improper use can lead to serious health complications.

If you have a specific infection you are concerned about, consult a doctor or other qualified healthcare professional for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. They can prescribe the correct medication(s) based on your specific needs.
