# Fibrinolysin
### Generic Name
Fibrinolysin (in combination with Deoxyribonuclease I)

### Usage
Fibrinolysin, when used in combination with deoxyribonuclease I (DNase), is a topical enzyme preparation.  Its primary use is as a wound-healing ointment, specifically targeting superficial wounds and burns. The combination works by breaking down fibrin (a protein involved in blood clot formation) and DNA from dead cells within the wound bed. This action helps to clean the wound, removing necrotic tissue and promoting a cleaner environment for healing.  It's important to note that this combination is primarily used for cleaning superficial wounds and is not a treatment for deeper wounds or systemic infections.  The therapeutic benefit relies on the synergistic action of both enzymes.  Currently, this combination is not approved for use in the USA.

### Dosage
Dosage information for fibrinolysin/deoxyribonuclease I ointment varies depending on the specific product formulation and the manufacturer's instructions.  Always refer to the prescribing information provided with the medication.  Generally, the ointment is applied topically to the affected area, typically once or twice daily.  The amount used will depend on the size and severity of the wound.  Children and adults may use the same application method, although dosage adjustments based on wound surface area may be necessary.  It is crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and not exceed the recommended amount.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site.  These may include:

* Mild stinging or burning sensation upon application
* Redness or irritation of the skin
* Swelling
* Itching

Serious side effects are rare.  However, allergic reactions are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:

* Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis):  Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, or hives.
* Signs of infection at the application site (increased pain, swelling, pus).

Always consult a healthcare provider if you experience any adverse effects.

### How it Works
Fibrinolysin, a proteolytic enzyme, breaks down fibrin, a key component of blood clots and dead tissue.  Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase) breaks down DNA released from dead cells within the wound.  The combined action of these enzymes helps to remove necrotic tissue and debris, creating a cleaner environment for wound healing. This synergistic effect promotes the healing process by facilitating the removal of obstacles to tissue regeneration.  The enzymes primarily target dead tissue and do not harm healthy, living cells.


### Precautions
* **Allergic Reactions:** Individuals with known allergies to fibrinolysin, DNase, or any components of the ointment should avoid using it.
* **Open Wounds:** While intended for open wounds, this ointment should not be applied to deep wounds or wounds showing signs of severe infection.  Consult a physician for such injuries.
* **Drug Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are known, but always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Children:** Use in children should be under the supervision of a healthcare professional.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for fibrinolysin/DNase ointment to work?** A: The time it takes to see results varies depending on the wound.  Improved wound cleaning is often observed within a few days of use.  Complete healing time depends on the size and depth of the wound.
* **Q: Can I use this ointment on all types of wounds?** A: No, it's primarily intended for superficial wounds and burns.  Do not use it on deep wounds, infected wounds, or wounds requiring surgical intervention.  Consult a healthcare professional for appropriate wound management.
