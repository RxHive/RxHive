# Fluticasone (Topical)
### Generic Name
Fluticasone (Topical)

### Usage
Fluticasone topical is a corticosteroid used to treat the inflammation and itching associated with various skin conditions.  Its primary use is in managing corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in adults.  It's also indicated for relieving the itching of atopic dermatitis (eczema) in patients aged 3 months and older.  The specific conditions it treats fall under the broader category of skin disorders that respond positively to corticosteroids.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Atopic Dermatitis:**
    * Cream (0.05%): Apply a thin layer to the affected area once or twice daily. Gently rub it in.
    * Lotion (0.05%): Apply a thin layer once daily. Gently rub it in.
* **Corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses:**
    * Cream (0.05%) or Ointment (0.005%): Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice daily. Gently rub it in.

If there's no improvement within two weeks, a reevaluation of the diagnosis is necessary.

**Children (3 months and older):**

    * Cream (0.05%): Apply a thin layer once or twice daily. Gently rub it in.
    * Lotion (0.05%): Apply a thin layer once daily. Gently rub it in.
* **Corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses:**
    * Cream (0.05%): Apply a thin layer twice daily. Gently rub it in.

If there's no improvement within two weeks, a reevaluation of the diagnosis is necessary.  The safety and effectiveness of using Fluticasone topical for more than four weeks in children haven't been fully established.

### How it Works

Fluticasone topical is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, anti-itching, and vasoconstricting (narrowing of blood vessels) properties. It works by reducing the production, release, and activity of inflammatory chemicals in the body. This is achieved through the induction of proteins that inhibit phospholipase A2, an enzyme crucial in the inflammatory process.  This ultimately leads to a decrease in inflammation and itching.  Fluticasone has an intermediate potency among topical corticosteroids.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Cream and ointment formulations are contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to fluticasone or any component of the formulation.  There are no contraindications reported for the lotion in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Warnings:** There's an increased risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression (affecting hormone production), other endocrine effects, local adverse reactions (skin atrophy), systemic effects, skin infections, allergic contact dermatitis, and reduced growth velocity in children.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Fluticasone topical is classified as Category C during pregnancy.  Low- to moderate-potency topical corticosteroids are preferred during pregnancy, and large amounts or prolonged use should be avoided. Excretion in breast milk is unknown, requiring cautious use.  Avoid applying to the breasts until breastfeeding ceases.  High-potency topical corticosteroids used on the nipple area have been linked to hypertension in breastfed infants.
* **Interactions:** Fluticasone topical may decrease the levels or effects of certain medications, and conversely, may increase the levels or effects of others. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.
* **General Considerations:** Apply sparingly in a thin film, rubbing in gently. Avoid contact with eyes, and generally avoid routine use on the face, underarms, or groin area. Do not use occlusive dressings.
