# Felbinac
### Generic Name
Felbinac

### Usage
Felbinac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used topically to relieve symptoms associated with various conditions.  Its primary use is for the symptomatic relief of pain and inflammation in rheumatic conditions, minor arthritic problems, and soft tissue injuries such as sprains, strains, and contusions.  While not its primary indication, Felbinac gel may also be used as a coupling agent for ultrasound examinations.


### Dosage
**Adults:**

* **Gel (3%):** Apply a ribbon of gel approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) long to the affected area 2-4 times daily. Treatment should not exceed 14 days without reassessment by a healthcare professional.
* **Foam (3.17%):** Apply an amount roughly the size of a golf ball (approximately 1.5 inches [4 cm] in diameter) to the affected area 2-4 times daily.  Regularly assess the need for continued treatment; prolonged use beyond 6 weeks is not recommended.

**Important Note:** For both gel and foam, a maximum daily dose of 25 grams should not be exceeded, regardless of the number or size of affected areas. One inch of gel or a golf ball-sized amount of foam is approximately 1 gram of Felbinac.

**Children:** Use of Felbinac gel and over-the-counter foam is contraindicated in children under 12 years of age.  For children aged 12 and older, the adult dosage may be used, but only under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. Consult a doctor for guidance if you have these conditions.

* Paresthesia (pins and needles sensation)
* Dermatitis (skin inflammation)
* Erythema (redness)
* Pruritus (itching)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

### How it Works
Felbinac is an NSAID with analgesic (pain-relieving) and anti-inflammatory properties. It works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes.  These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, substances that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, Felbinac helps alleviate pain and inflammation at the site of application.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Felbinac or any formulation component.
* History of asthma, urticaria (hives), or allergic rhinitis triggered by aspirin or other NSAIDs.
* Children under 12 years of age (for gel and OTC foam).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of anaphylactoid reactions in patients with aspirin triad (asthma, aspirin intolerance, and rhinitis).
* Increased risk of photosensitivity reactions.
* Potential for skin reactions.
* Potential for systemic effects (hypersensitivity, asthma, renal disease).
* Use with caution in asthmatic patients.
* Avoid application to open wounds, eyes, or mucous membranes.
* Avoid using occlusive dressings or applying with other topical preparations.
* Wash hands after application unless they are the treatment area.
* Limit sun exposure.
*  Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.  Do not use occlusive dressings.  Do not apply to the same area as other topical preparations. Do not use for more than 7 days without medical supervision (for OTC foam and gel).


**Drug Interactions:** Felbinac may interact with various medications, including anticoagulants, aspirin, corticosteroids, and others. It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting Felbinac.  This information is not exhaustive and professional advice should be sought.


### FAQs

**Q: How should I store Felbinac?**

A: Store Felbinac as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature and away from direct sunlight and heat. Protect the canister from sunlight (for foam).


**Q: Can I use Felbinac during pregnancy or while breastfeeding?**

A:  Use of NSAIDs during pregnancy, especially late pregnancy, should be avoided due to the potential risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. The excretion of Felbinac in breast milk after topical application is unknown. Consult your doctor before using Felbinac if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Apply the next dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.


**Q: How long does it take for Felbinac to work?**

A: The onset of action varies depending on the individual and the condition being treated.  You may experience some relief of symptoms within a short time, but full therapeutic effect may take longer.

**Q: Can I use Felbinac with other topical medications?**

A:  It is generally not recommended to use Felbinac with other topical medications on the same area of skin. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about using Felbinac with other medications.
