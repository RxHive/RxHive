# Felbinac

**Generic Name:** Felbinac

**Usage:** Felbinac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and inflammation.  Its specific uses may vary depending on the formulation (e.g., topical gel, oral tablet) and the prescribing physician's judgment. Common uses include:

* **Pain relief:**  For conditions such as muscle aches, sprains, strains, and arthritis pain (including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis).
* **Inflammation reduction:** To reduce swelling and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders.


**Side Effects:**  Like other NSAIDs, Felbinac can cause a range of side effects, which can vary in severity.  Some common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Heartburn, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation, ulcers, bleeding.
* **Cardiovascular:**  Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure.
* **Renal:**  Fluid retention, kidney problems.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue (angioedema), difficulty breathing.
* **Other:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, ringing in the ears (tinnitus).


**How it Works:** Felbinac works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By blocking prostaglandin production, Felbinac reduces pain and inflammation.  The specific mechanism of action may vary slightly depending on the formulation (e.g., topical vs. oral).  Topical applications primarily work locally, while oral formulations have systemic effects.
