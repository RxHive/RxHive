# Fenfluramine
### Generic Name
Fenfluramine

### Usage
Fenfluramine is a medication primarily used to treat seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients aged 2 years and older.  These are rare and severe types of epilepsy characterized by frequent and difficult-to-control seizures.  It's important to note that Fenfluramine is not a first-line treatment for these conditions and is typically used when other medications have proven ineffective.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Fenfluramine dosage is highly individualized and requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional. The information below is for general understanding only and should not be interpreted as a self-prescribing guide.

**Dravet syndrome/Lennox-Gastaut syndrome associated seizures:**

* **Adults and Children (â‰¥2 years):** Dosage starts at a low dose (0.1 mg/kg twice daily) and is gradually increased weekly based on response and tolerability, under strict medical supervision.  The maximum daily dose varies depending on whether the patient is also taking stiripentol and clobazam (concomitant medications).  Consult your physician for specific dosage limits.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Fenfluramine is generally not recommended for individuals with impaired liver function.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with moderate to severe kidney problems.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage based on the patient's kidney function (eGFR).
* **Administration:** Fenfluramine is typically administered orally, using a provided oral syringe to ensure accurate dosing.  It can also be administered through a gastric or nasogastric tube if needed.

### How it Works

Fenfluramine's exact mechanism in treating Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome seizures isn't fully understood. However, it's known that fenfluramine and its metabolite, norfenfluramine, increase the levels of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, sleep, and other functions.  By affecting serotonin levels and interacting with serotonin receptors, Fenfluramine may help to reduce seizure activity.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Do not use Fenfluramine if you are allergic to it or any of its components.
* **MAOI Inhibitors:** Avoid using Fenfluramine concurrently with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within 14 days of stopping MAOI treatment.
* **Cardiovascular Issues:** Fenfluramine carries a risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Regular echocardiograms are crucial to monitor for these conditions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of Fenfluramine during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established. Consult your physician to carefully weigh the risks and benefits.
* **Other Medications:** Fenfluramine can interact with many other drugs.  Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Fenfluramine may cause drowsiness or dizziness.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you.
* **Children:**  Use in children under 2 years old is not recommended.
* **Suicide Risk:** There's a risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with this medicine.  Close monitoring is essential, particularly in patients with a history of depression or suicidal ideation.
