# Fingolimod

**Generic Name:** Fingolimod

**Usage:**

Fingolimod is used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults.  It reduces the frequency of MS relapses (attacks) and slows the progression of disability.  It is specifically indicated for patients with active disease despite treatment with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate.


**Side Effects:**

Fingolimod can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  The most common side effects include:

* **Headache:** This is frequently reported.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be a significant issue, especially early in treatment.
* **Influenza-like illness:**  Symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue.
* **Back pain:**  A relatively common complaint.
* **Nasopharyngitis (common cold):** Upper respiratory tract infection.
* **Increased liver enzymes:**  Monitored through blood tests.
* **Bradycardia (slow heart rate):**  A potentially serious side effect, especially in the initial few hours after the first dose.


**Serious side effects, although less common, include:**

* **Macular edema (swelling of the macula in the eye):** Can affect vision and requires careful monitoring.
* **Atrioventricular block (heart block):**  A serious heart rhythm problem.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  Can lead to fainting or dizziness.
* **Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML):** A rare but potentially fatal brain infection. This risk is increased in patients with certain other health conditions or who are taking other immunosuppressants.
* **Infection:** Increased susceptibility to infections due to its immunosuppressant effects.
* **Liver injury:** Elevated liver enzymes should be monitored.
* **Atrial fibrillation:** An irregular heartbeat.


**How it Works:**

Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator (S1P receptor modulator).  It works by binding to specific receptors on lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).  This prevents the lymphocytes from leaving lymph nodes, reducing their ability to enter the central nervous system (CNS) and causing inflammation that contributes to MS relapses.  By keeping these inflammatory cells in the lymph nodes, it lessens the immune attack on the myelin sheath surrounding nerves in the brain and spinal cord.


**FAQs:**

* **How is Fingolimod administered?**  It's taken orally once daily.
* **What should I tell my doctor before taking Fingolimod?**  You should inform your doctor about all your medical conditions, including heart problems, liver problems, infections, and any other medications you are taking.  It's crucial to disclose all pre-existing conditions, particularly those mentioned in the 'serious side effects' section above.
* **Are there any specific monitoring requirements?** Yes.  Regular blood tests will be required to monitor liver function and heart rate.  Eye exams are also recommended to detect macular edema.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.  Do not double the next dose.
* **Can I drive while taking Fingolimod?**  Driving may be affected, especially early in treatment, due to side effects like dizziness.  Follow your doctor's advice.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Fingolimod?**  Consult your doctor; alcohol could interact with the medication or worsen side effects.
* **Can Fingolimod be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  It's generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Consult your doctor.
