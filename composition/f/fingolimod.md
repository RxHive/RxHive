# Fingolimod
### Generic Name
Fingolimod

### Usage
Fingolimod is primarily used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients aged 10 years and older.  Relapsing MS is characterized by periods of disease activity (relapses) followed by periods of remission.  Fingolimod helps to reduce the frequency of these relapses and slows the progression of disability.  It's important to note that Fingolimod doesn't cure MS but rather manages its symptoms and progression.

### Dosage

**Oral Administration:**

* **Adults (≥18 years):** The usual dose is 0.5 mg once daily.  The first dose requires monitoring due to potential side effects.  Patients reinitiating treatment after a break of more than 14 days also need this first-dose monitoring.

* **Pediatric Patients (≥10 years):** The dosage depends on weight:
    * Patients weighing ≤40 kg: 0.25 mg once daily.
    * Patients weighing >40 kg: 0.5 mg once daily.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For mild to moderate impairment, no dose adjustment is typically needed.  For severe impairment, the manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dose adjustments; use with caution is advised.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustments are specified in the manufacturer's labeling;  use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment is recommended.
* **Hepatotoxicity:** If serum ALT levels exceed three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin levels are more than twice the ULN, treatment should be interrupted. If an alternative cause for liver injury can't be identified, Fingolimod should be permanently discontinued due to the risk of severe liver damage.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (≥10%):**

* Headache
* Cough
* Sinusitis
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Increased serum AST and ALP levels (liver enzymes)
* Influenza (flu)
* Increased serum gamma-glutamyl transferase levels


**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less, including post-marketing reports):**

* Seizures
* Migraine
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Atrioventricular block (heart conduction problem)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Bronchitis
* Decreased lung function
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Skin rashes
* Increased serum triglycerides
* Lymphocytopenia (low lymphocyte count)
* Herpes virus infections
* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML, a rare and serious brain infection)
* Macular edema (swelling of the macula in the eye)
* Various cancers (lymphoma, skin cancers)
* Hepatic injury


**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator.  After being metabolized in the body, it binds to specific S1P receptors on lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). This binding prevents lymphocytes from leaving the lymph nodes, reducing their number in the bloodstream. While the exact mechanism by which this reduces MS symptoms isn't fully understood, it is believed to lessen inflammation and immune cell infiltration in the central nervous system.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fingolimod is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, those with recent heart attack, unstable angina, stroke, certain heart conditions (e.g., severe heart failure, certain types of heart block), or a prolonged QTc interval.

* **Interactions:** Fingolimod can interact with many medications, including some antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers, and other drugs that affect heart rate or conduction. It can also interact with immunosuppressants and vaccines.  Discuss all medications and supplements with a healthcare provider before starting Fingolimod.

* **Warnings:**  Fingolimod can increase the risk of infections (especially herpes viruses), bradycardia, hypertension, liver injury, macular edema, PML, and various cancers.  It can also cause fetal harm;  women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for two months afterward.  Breastfeeding while using Fingolimod should be carefully considered, as excretion in breast milk is unknown.  Older adults and individuals with pre-existing liver or kidney disease should be monitored closely.  Sudden discontinuation should be avoided.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Fingolimod?** A:  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.  Alcohol can potentially interact with or worsen some side effects.

* **Q: How should I store Fingolimod?** A:  Store as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Fingolimod suddenly?** A: No, sudden discontinuation can lead to a serious worsening of MS symptoms (including a severe increase in disability).  Always consult your doctor before stopping treatment.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare professional immediately to report any concerning side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent.
