# Fondaparinux

**Generic Name:** Fondaparinux

**Usage:** Fondaparinux is a blood thinner (anticoagulant) used to prevent blood clots (thrombosis) in several situations, including:

* **Prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) after certain types of surgery:**  Specifically, hip replacement or knee replacement surgery.
* **Treatment of DVT and PE:** In some cases, it can be used to treat existing blood clots, often in conjunction with other therapies.
* **Prevention of blood clots in hospitalized patients with acute medical conditions:** These conditions are often associated with an increased risk of blood clots.

**Important Note:** Fondaparinux is administered via subcutaneous injection (under the skin), not orally.  Dosage and duration are determined by a doctor based on individual needs and risk factors.

**Side Effects:** Like all medications, fondaparinux can cause side effects.  Common side effects include:

* **Bleeding:** This is the most significant risk.  Bleeding can range from minor bruising to severe, life-threatening hemorrhage.
* **Injection site reactions:** Pain, bruising, swelling, or redness at the injection site are relatively common.
* **Anemia:**  A decrease in red blood cells.
* **Thrombocytopenia:** A decrease in platelets (blood cells essential for clotting).
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Headache:**
* **Back pain:**


**Rare but serious side effects include:**

* **Spinal hematoma (bleeding around the spinal cord):** This can lead to permanent paralysis.  Patients at higher risk (e.g., those with spinal surgery or undergoing spinal anesthesia) should be carefully monitored.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  These are rare but can be life-threatening.
* **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is extremely rare with Fondaparinux** because it is not a heparin derivative like other anticoagulants.


**How it Works:** Fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide (a type of sugar molecule). It works by selectively inhibiting factor Xa, a clotting factor in the blood. By blocking factor Xa, fondaparinux prevents the formation of blood clots.  It is specifically designed to have a lower risk of causing HIT compared to heparin.
