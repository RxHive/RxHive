# Fenoverine
### Generic Name
Fenoverine

### Usage
Fenoverine is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation) and gastrointestinal spasms.  It helps alleviate the painful cramps and discomfort associated with these conditions. While its primary use is for these specific symptoms, it's crucial to remember that it addresses the symptoms and not the underlying cause of the condition.  Therefore, it's always best to consult a healthcare professional to determine the root cause of your pain and the most appropriate treatment plan.

### Dosage
**Adults:** For dysmenorrhea and gastrointestinal spasms, the usual oral dose is 100 mg three times a day (TID).  Depending on the effectiveness and how well it's tolerated, the doctor may increase this to 200 mg TID.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of fenoverine in children have not been established, therefore it is not recommended for use in children under 12 years old.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a physician before taking fenoverine if you have any liver or kidney conditions.

### Side Effects
Common side effects, though their exact frequency isn't defined, can include:

* Constipation
* Gastrointestinal upset
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)

Less common, but more serious side effects, requiring immediate medical attention, may include:

* Increased myoglobin levels
* Increased creatine phosphokinase levels
* Muscle pain (myalgia)
* Rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle tissue)
* Renal insufficiency (reduced kidney function)

If you experience any of these side effects, stop taking fenoverine and seek immediate medical advice.

### How it Works
Fenoverine is classified as an anticholinergic agent. It works by inhibiting the overstimulation of muscle cells that contributes to the painful sensations associated with dysmenorrhea and gastrointestinal spasms.  By reducing this overstimulation, it helps to alleviate the discomfort.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Fenoverine should not be used by individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to fenoverine or any of its components.
* Malignant hyperthermia or a history of high fever related to anesthesia or exercise.
* Chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, acute or alcoholic hepatitis, chronic alcohol abuse, liver cancer, or hepatic failure.
* Renal failure
* Mitochondrial muscle disease
* Children under 12 years of age


**Warnings:** There's an increased risk of myalgia (muscle pain) and rhabdomyolysis with fenoverine use.  

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Fenoverine should be avoided during pregnancy.  It's excreted in breast milk, making breastfeeding inadvisable while using this medication.

**Drug Interactions:**  While specific drug interactions aren't extensively detailed, it's essential to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are currently taking to assess potential interactions.
