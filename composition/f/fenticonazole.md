# Fenticonazole

**Generic Name:** Fenticonazole

**Usage:** Fenticonazole is an antifungal medication used to treat various fungal infections, primarily:

* **Vaginal yeast infections (candidiasis):** This is the most common use.  It's available as a cream or pessary (vaginal suppository).
* **Ringworm (tinea corporis):**  Treatment of fungal skin infections on the body.  Usually applied topically as a cream.
* **Athlete's foot (tinea pedis):**  Topical treatment for this fungal infection of the feet.
* **Jock itch (tinea cruris):** Topical treatment for this fungal infection in the groin area.

**Note:**  The specific formulation (cream, pessary) and strength will vary depending on the infection being treated. Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and infrequent, but can include:

* **Topical application:** Burning, stinging, redness, or itching at the application site.  These are usually temporary and mild.
* **Vaginal use:** Vaginal irritation, burning, or discomfort.


**How it Works:** Fenticonazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent.  It works by interfering with the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes.  Disrupting ergosterol production damages the fungal cell membrane, leading to cell death and ultimately clearing the infection.
