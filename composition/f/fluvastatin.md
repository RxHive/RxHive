# Fluvastatin
### Generic Name
Fluvastatin

### Usage

Fluvastatin is primarily used to lower high cholesterol levels in the blood.  This includes reducing levels of total cholesterol, LDL ("bad") cholesterol, and triglycerides, while increasing levels of HDL ("good") cholesterol. It's prescribed for people with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (a genetic condition causing high cholesterol) and, as an alternative treatment, for those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (a more severe form).  Fluvastatin also plays a role in preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), a condition where plaque builds up in the arteries, by lowering cholesterol levels and potentially offering other beneficial effects on blood vessels.  Its use in ASCVD prevention is often considered in individuals with specific risk factors, such as age, existing cholesterol levels, and calculated risk of a cardiovascular event.  The specific indication and dosage will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and risk factors.

### Dosage

Fluvastatin dosages vary greatly depending on the individual's condition, response to treatment, and other medications they're taking.  It's crucial to follow your doctor's prescription exactly.

**Adults:** Fluvastatin comes in immediate-release capsules and extended-release tablets. Dosages range from 20 mg to 80 mg daily, sometimes divided into two doses per day.  The choice between immediate-release and extended-release, and the specific dosage, are determined by your doctor based on your individual needs.

**Children:** Fluvastatin is sometimes used in children aged 10 years and older (girls must be at least one year post-menarche).  The starting dose is typically lower than for adults and is carefully titrated upwards (increased gradually) over time as needed, always under a doctor's supervision.  Extended-release tablets are generally not used to initiate treatment in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors such as liver or kidney function.  Individuals with liver problems may need a lower dose or may not be able to take Fluvastatin at all.  The dosage may need to be modified for those with severe kidney impairment. Fluvastatin should be stopped immediately and the doctor consulted if severe muscle pain or fatigue is experienced.

### Side Effects

**Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Insomnia
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Sinusitis
* Bronchitis
* Urinary tract infection

**Less common, but serious side effects (affecting <1% of patients):**  These include, but are not limited to, rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle breakdown), liver damage (hepatotoxicity), pancreatitis, allergic reactions, and certain types of muscle disorders (myopathy and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy).

**Important Note:** If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Fluvastatin is a statin drug that works by inhibiting an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is crucial in the body's production of cholesterol. By inhibiting this enzyme, Fluvastatin lowers the amount of cholesterol produced in the liver, leading to reduced cholesterol levels in the blood.  It also increases levels of HDL ("good") cholesterol.  Beyond its primary effect on cholesterol, Fluvastatin might have additional benefits, such as improving the function of blood vessel linings and reducing inflammation.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fluvastatin is contraindicated in individuals with active liver disease, unexplained persistent elevations in liver enzymes, hypersensitivity to Fluvastatin or its components, during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and in women who may become pregnant.
* **Interactions:** Fluvastatin can interact with other medications, such as cyclosporine, fluconazole, gemfibrozil, other fibrates, niacin (in high doses), glyburide, phenytoin, warfarin, and colchicine. Consult your doctor about any medications you are currently taking.
* **Warnings:**  Fluvastatin can increase the risk of muscle problems (myopathy or rhabdomyolysis), especially when combined with certain other drugs.  Liver function should be monitored regularly.  Older adults may be more sensitive to side effects.  Careful monitoring is required if diabetes develops during treatment.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take Fluvastatin with alcohol?**  A:  While there aren't specific warnings against moderate alcohol consumption, excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of liver damage, so it's best to discuss this with your doctor.

**Q: How should I store Fluvastatin?** A: Store Fluvastatin as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

**Q: Can I stop taking Fluvastatin if I feel better?** A: No, do not stop taking Fluvastatin without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can be harmful.

**Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose.

**Q: Is Fluvastatin safe for long-term use?** A:  Fluvastatin, like other statins, is generally safe for long-term use when prescribed and monitored by a doctor.  However, regular check-ups are essential to monitor for side effects.
