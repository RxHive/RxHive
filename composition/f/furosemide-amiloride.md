# Furosemide + Amiloride

**Generic Name:** Furosemide/Amiloride

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat fluid retention (edema) and high blood pressure (hypertension).  Furosemide is a loop diuretic that increases urine output, removing excess fluid and sodium from the body. Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it helps prevent potassium loss that can occur with loop diuretics like furosemide.  The combination is often prescribed when the diuretic effect of furosemide alone isn't sufficient or when potassium loss needs to be minimized.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects may include:

* **From Furosemide:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, dehydration, low blood pressure (hypotension), muscle cramps, increased thirst, increased urination, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, skin rash.  More serious but less common side effects include hearing loss,  low potassium levels (hypokalemia), low magnesium levels (hypomagnesemia), and low sodium levels (hyponatremia).
* **From Amiloride:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, weakness, and skin rash.  Less common but serious side effects include high potassium levels (hyperkalemia), which can be life-threatening.

**How it Works:**

* **Furosemide:** This potent loop diuretic works in the loop of Henle in the kidneys, inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and water.  This increased excretion of sodium and water leads to a decrease in blood volume and blood pressure.
* **Amiloride:** This potassium-sparing diuretic works in the collecting ducts of the kidneys, blocking sodium channels and preventing sodium reabsorption while minimizing potassium loss.  This reduces blood pressure and helps prevent hypokalemia, a common side effect of furosemide.  The combined effect is a more effective reduction in fluid retention and blood pressure with better potassium balance than furosemide alone.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is this medication right for me?** A:  This is a prescription medication. Only a doctor can determine if this combination is appropriate for your specific health condition and medical history.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
