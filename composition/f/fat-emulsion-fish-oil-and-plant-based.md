# Fat Emulsion (Fish Oil And Plant Based)
### Generic Name
Fat Emulsion (Fish Oil and Plant Based)

### Usage
Fat emulsion (fish oil and plant-based) serves as a vital source of calories, essential fatty acids (including linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid), and omega-3 fatty acids.  Its primary use is in parenteral nutrition for adults who require intravenous feeding.  This is crucial for individuals who cannot receive adequate nutrition through the oral or enteral (feeding tube) routes.  While not explicitly stated in the provided information, the lipid-based nature of this emulsion might also be utilized in managing certain types of toxicity, particularly those involving highly lipid-soluble substances, by acting as a "lipid sink."  However, this is not its primary application.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** The recommended dose is 1-2 grams per kilogram of body weight per day (g/kg/day) administered intravenously (IV).  The daily dose is typically infused over 12-24 hours. The maximum recommended dose is 2.5 g/kg/day.  It's crucial that the calories derived from the fat emulsion do not exceed 60% of the total daily caloric intake. Close monitoring for allergic reactions (e.g., shortness of breath, cyanosis, fever) is essential at the start of therapy.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Safety and efficacy in children have not been established.  This medication should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The provided information does not specify dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. Consult with a healthcare professional for guidance in such cases.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Cardiovascular: Hypertension (high blood pressure), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
* Nervous System: Dizziness, headache
* Dermatologic: Pruritus (itching), skin rash
* Endocrine & Metabolic: Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), increased serum triglycerides, increased gamma-glutamyl transferase levels
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence (gas), dyspepsia (indigestion), cholestasis (reduced bile flow), diarrhea, dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Genitourinary: Urinary tract infection
* Hematologic & Oncologic: Anemia, leukocytosis (increased white blood cells)
* Hepatic: Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels
* Local: Catheter infection, sepsis (severe bloodstream infection)
* Respiratory: Dyspnea (shortness of breath), pneumonia
* Other: Fever


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):** Infection.


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Fat emulsion provides energy and essential fatty acids to the body through intravenous administration.  The body metabolizes the lipids in the emulsion as a source of calories.  It supplies linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, which are crucial for maintaining the structure and function of cell membranes.  In cases of local anesthetic toxicity, the lipid emulsion may help extract the anesthetic from cardiac muscle.  This is referred to as the "lipid sink" effect,  where the lipids offer an alternative binding site for lipid-soluble toxins.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to fish, egg, soybean, or any other component of the formulation.
* Severe hyperlipidemia (high blood fats) or severe lipid metabolism disorders characterized by hypertriglyceridemia (very high triglyceride levels, >1000 mg/dL).

**Increased Risk of:**

* Fat overload syndrome
* Hypertriglyceridemia
* Refeeding syndrome (in malnourished individuals)

**Use with Caution:**

* Patients with anemia
* Patients with bleeding disorders
* Patients at risk of fat embolism
* Patients with hepatic impairment
* Patients with renal impairment
* Patients with pancreatitis (without hyperlipidemia)
* Patients with respiratory disease

**Boxed Warning:**  Fat emulsion administration has been linked to deaths in preterm infants due to intravascular fat accumulation in the lungs.  Preterm and low-birth-weight infants have impaired clearance of IV lipid emulsions.


### FAQs

**Q: How is fat emulsion administered?**
A:  It's given intravenously (IV) through a peripheral or central venous line using DEHP-free administration sets and lines.  The infusion rate should be carefully controlled, starting slowly and gradually increasing as tolerated.

**Q: Can fat emulsion be mixed with other IV fluids?**
A: Yes, it can be simultaneously infused with amino acid dextrose mixtures using a Y-connector.  However, flow rates should be controlled separately, and the osmolarity of the combined solution needs to be considered (solutions with osmolarity â‰¥900 mOsm/L require central venous administration).

**Q: What should be monitored during fat emulsion therapy?**
A:  Regular monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance, blood glucose, blood counts, liver and kidney function tests, and triglyceride levels is crucial.  Patients should also be observed for signs of infection, fat overload, refeeding syndrome, and hypersensitivity reactions.

**Q: How should fat emulsion be stored?**
A: Storage instructions should be found on the product label. Consult the manufacturer's recommendations.
