**How it Works:**

Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).  It works by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, sleep, appetite, and other functions.  By blocking the reuptake of serotonin, fluoxetine allows more serotonin to remain in the synaptic cleft (the space between nerve cells), enhancing its effects.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?**  It usually takes several weeks to notice a significant improvement in symptoms.  Full therapeutic effect may take several months.
* **Can I stop taking it suddenly?**  No, you should never stop taking fluoxetine suddenly.  Stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms, which can be unpleasant and even serious.  Your doctor will help you gradually reduce your dose.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking fluoxetine?**  It's generally recommended to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking fluoxetine, as it can interact with the medication and increase the risk of side effects.
* **Can I take fluoxetine with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.
* **Is fluoxetine addictive?**  Fluoxetine is not considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids or other substances. However, individuals may experience withdrawal symptoms if they stop taking it abruptly.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
