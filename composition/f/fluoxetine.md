# Fluoxetine
### Generic Name
Fluoxetine

### Usage

Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) primarily used to treat depression, both major depressive disorder (unipolar depression) and depression associated with bipolar disorder.  It's also approved for treating bulimia nervosa (when used with psychotherapy), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and panic disorder.  Importantly,  it's often used off-label for various other conditions, including generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), binge-eating disorder, and fibromyalgia.  The effectiveness and safety of fluoxetine for these off-label uses vary, and should always be discussed with a healthcare provider.


### Dosage

Fluoxetine dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and their response to the medication.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.

**Adults:**  Starting doses range from 5mg to 20mg daily, often increasing gradually (over weeks or months) to a higher dose as needed and tolerated, up to a maximum of 80mg daily.  The exact dosage and titration schedule depend on the specific condition being treated. For example, treating depression might start at 20mg daily, whereas panic disorder might begin with a lower dose, such as 5-10mg.  Treatment for PMDD can be continuous daily or intermittent, during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.

**Children and Adolescents:** Fluoxetine is approved for children and adolescents for specific conditions (like depression and OCD) but requires careful dose adjustment based on age and weight.  Dosages are usually significantly lower than adult doses and are always determined by a pediatrician or child psychiatrist.  Lower weight children might start at 5mg daily, while heavier children and adolescents may start at 10mg daily.  Maximum doses are also lower in children.

**Administration:** Fluoxetine is typically available as capsules, oral solution (liquid), and delayed-release capsules.  Take it as directed by your healthcare provider, usually once or twice daily.

### How it Works

Fluoxetine works by selectively blocking the reuptake of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, sleep, appetite, and other functions. By increasing the availability of serotonin in the brain, fluoxetine helps alleviate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other related disorders.  It has minimal effects on other neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fluoxetine should not be used with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. A significant time gap (at least 2 weeks) is required between discontinuing one and starting the other. It is also contraindicated in those hypersensitive to fluoxetine.  Certain other drug combinations are also contraindicated, including pimozide and thioridazine.
* **Interactions:**  Fluoxetine can interact with numerous other medications, including other antidepressants, pain relievers, blood thinners, and herbal supplements.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Fluoxetine is categorized as a Pregnancy Category C drug.  The potential benefits must be carefully weighed against the potential risks to the fetus.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is generally discouraged while taking fluoxetine.
* **Elderly Patients:** Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the side effects of fluoxetine, and lower doses may be necessary.
* **Children and Adolescents:** Increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior has been observed in this population; close monitoring is essential.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed for patients with liver or kidney disease.
