# Ferrous Bisglycinate + Zinc bisglycinate + Folic Acid + Methylcobalamin

**Generic Name:**  Ferrous Bisglycinate + Zinc Bisglycinate + Folic Acid + Methylcobalamin

**Usage:** This combination supplement is primarily used to address deficiencies in iron, zinc, folate (folic acid), and vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin).  It's often recommended for:

* **Iron deficiency anemia:** Iron is crucial for red blood cell production.
* **Zinc deficiency:** Zinc plays a vital role in numerous bodily functions, including immune function and wound healing.
* **Folate deficiency:** Folate is essential for DNA synthesis and cell division, crucial during pregnancy and for overall health. Deficiency can lead to anemia and neural tube defects in developing fetuses.
* **Vitamin B12 deficiency:** B12 is important for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. Deficiency can cause anemia and neurological problems.


**Side Effects:** While generally well-tolerated, side effects can occur, though they are usually mild and depend on the dosage:

* **Iron:** Constipation, nausea, stomach upset, dark stools.  High doses can be harmful.
* **Zinc:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, loss of appetite.  High doses can interfere with copper absorption.
* **Folic Acid:**  Generally well-tolerated, but high doses may mask a vitamin B12 deficiency.
* **Methylcobalamin:** Generally well-tolerated, but some individuals might experience mild digestive upset.


**How it Works:**

* **Ferrous Bisglycinate:**  A highly bioavailable form of iron, meaning the body absorbs it efficiently. It works by providing iron for hemoglobin production in red blood cells.
* **Zinc Bisglycinate:** A highly bioavailable form of zinc, improving absorption compared to other forms.  Zinc participates in numerous enzyme reactions and plays a role in various bodily processes.
* **Folic Acid:**  The synthetic form of folate. It acts as a coenzyme in various metabolic processes, particularly those involving DNA synthesis and cell division.
* **Methylcobalamin:** The active form of vitamin B12. It's essential for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis.
