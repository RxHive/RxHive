# Fusidic Acid

**Generic Name:** Fusidic Acid

**Usage:** Fusidic acid is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial skin infections, such as:

* Impetigo
* Folliculitis (infection of hair follicles)
* Cellulitis (infection of the deeper layers of skin)
* Abscesses (pus-filled lumps)
* Wound infections
* Secondary bacterial infections of eczema or psoriasis


It's available in various forms including creams, ointments, gels, eye drops, and sometimes oral capsules (though less common).  The specific usage will depend on the infection site and severity, as determined by a doctor.  It's crucial to **only use fusidic acid as prescribed by a healthcare professional.**

**Side Effects:** Fusidic acid is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur. These are usually mild and include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, itching, redness, or rash at the application site.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but possible, ranging from mild rash to serious reactions like swelling of the face, lips, or tongue (anaphylaxis). Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* **Eye irritation (with eye drops):** Stinging or burning sensation.


Less common side effects may include:

*  Discoloration of the skin at the application site.
*  Thinning of the skin (especially with prolonged use).


**How it Works:** Fusidic acid is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, meaning it inhibits the growth of bacteria. It works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis, preventing the bacteria from producing essential proteins needed for their survival and reproduction. This ultimately leads to the death of the bacteria causing the infection.  It's effective against a range of Gram-positive bacteria, including *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococcus* species.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I use fusidic acid for any skin infection?** No. It's only effective against bacterial infections and should not be used for viral or fungal infections. A doctor needs to diagnose the infection before prescribing it.
* **How long should I use fusidic acid?** The duration of treatment depends on the severity of the infection and the response to treatment.  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Do not stop treatment prematurely even if the infection seems to have cleared.
* **Can I use fusidic acid while pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Discuss with your doctor before using fusidic acid if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  The benefits and risks need to be carefully weighed.
* **Can I use fusidic acid with other medications?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, to avoid potential drug interactions.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not apply a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent.
