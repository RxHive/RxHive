# Fusidic Acid
### Generic Name
Fusidic Acid

### Usage
Fusidic acid is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial skin infections.  Its primary use is for localized infections like impetigo, folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles), and infected wounds. It's also effective against some types of secondary bacterial infections that complicate eczema or psoriasis.  While primarily a topical antibiotic (applied to the skin), it's available in oral and injection forms for more severe or systemic infections, though these are less common.  It's important to note that fusidic acid is not effective against all types of bacteria, and a doctor should always determine the appropriate treatment based on the specific infection.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the form of fusidic acid (cream, ointment, oral capsule, or injection) and the severity of the infection.  A doctor will prescribe the specific dosage and duration of treatment.  

* **Topical (Cream/Ointment):**  Typically applied a thin layer to the affected area 2-3 times daily.  The exact amount will depend on the size of the affected area.  Always follow the instructions on the prescription label.

* **Oral (Capsules):** Dosage is determined by the doctor based on the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the infection. This is usually prescribed only for more severe infections not responding to topical treatment.

* **Intravenous (Injection):**  This route is reserved for serious systemic infections and is administered under strict medical supervision in a hospital setting. Dosage is determined by a physician based on the patientâ€™s condition.

Dosage for children is always determined by a physician based on weight and the specific condition.  There isn't a standardized child dosage that can be provided here.


### Side Effects
* **Common Side Effects:** Itching, burning, or stinging at the application site (for topical use); nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting (for oral use); injection site reactions (for IV use).
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing); tendon inflammation or rupture (though rare, especially with prolonged use); liver damage (rare).
* **Important Note:** If you experience any side effects, particularly severe or unusual ones, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Fusidic acid is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, meaning it inhibits the growth of bacteria.  It works by binding to a bacterial ribosome, a cellular structure involved in protein synthesis. By interfering with this process, fusidic acid prevents the bacteria from producing the proteins necessary for their survival and replication. This leads to a reduction in the bacterial population and eventually resolves the infection.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Fusidic acid should be avoided if you have a known allergy to it.
* **Drug Interactions:** It can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by the liver.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered under strict medical supervision, weighing the benefits against the potential risks.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.
* **Children:** Use in children should be guided by a physician.  Topical application should avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.
* **Liver Impairment:** Patients with liver problems may require adjustments in dosage or close monitoring.
* **Prolonged use:**  Prolonged use of fusidic acid can lead to the development of resistant bacteria.  Therefore, the course of treatment should be completed as prescribed, even if symptoms improve before the medication is finished.

### FAQs
* **Q: Can I use fusidic acid for any skin infection?** A: No, fusidic acid is only effective against certain bacterial infections. A doctor must diagnose the infection to determine if it's appropriate.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: This varies based on the infection's severity and the form of medication used.  Improvement should be seen within a few days, but a complete course is necessary for eradication.
* **Q: Can I stop taking it early if I feel better?** A: No.  Completing the prescribed course is crucial to prevent the recurrence of infection and the development of antibiotic resistance.
* **Q: How should I store fusidic acid?** A: Store according to the label instructions, usually at room temperature away from direct heat and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult the prescription instructions or your doctor for advice on missed doses.  Generally, don't double up on doses.
* **Q: Is fusidic acid safe for long-term use?** A:  No, long-term use is generally discouraged due to the risk of side effects and the development of antibiotic resistance.  Use should only be as directed and under medical supervision.
