# Fluocinolone acetonide + Neomycin

**Generic Name:** Fluocinolone acetonide and neomycin

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid and antibiotic used to treat various skin conditions involving inflammation and bacterial infection.  Specific uses include:

* **Inflammatory skin conditions with secondary bacterial infection:**  Examples include eczema (dermatitis), psoriasis, and contact dermatitis. The corticosteroid reduces inflammation and itching, while the antibiotic targets bacterial growth preventing further complications.
* **Infected insect bites, minor abrasions, and burns:**  Only in cases where bacterial infection is suspected or present.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the area of application, duration of use, and individual sensitivity.  Common side effects include:

* **At the application site:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness, dryness, skin thinning, irritation, and increased hair growth (hypertrichosis).  Prolonged use can cause skin atrophy (thinning and weakening of the skin).
* **Systemic side effects (less common, but more likely with large surface area application or prolonged use):**  These are rare but can include adrenal suppression (especially in children and with large doses), increased blood sugar levels, and cataracts. Allergic reactions are also possible.
* **Neomycin-specific side effects:**  Neomycin can cause allergic contact dermatitis (a reaction that worsens the skin condition).


**How it Works:**

* **Fluocinolone acetonide:** This is a potent corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation in the skin. It acts by suppressing the activity of the immune system in the affected area, thus reducing redness, swelling, itching, and inflammation.
* **Neomycin:** This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, thus killing or inhibiting the growth of susceptible bacteria commonly associated with skin infections. The combination provides both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects to treat the skin condition effectively.
