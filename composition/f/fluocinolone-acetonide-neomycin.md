# Fluocinolone acetonide + Neomycin
### Generic Name
Fluocinolone acetonide + Neomycin

### Usage

Fluocinolone acetonide and neomycin combination cream or ointment is primarily used to treat inflammatory skin conditions that are complicated by bacterial infection.  This combination therapy targets both the inflammation and the infection simultaneously.  Fluocinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation, itching, and redness. Neomycin is an antibiotic that fights against bacteria commonly found in skin infections.  The primary use is for conditions like eczema or dermatitis that have become secondarily infected.  It's important to note that this combination is not suitable for all skin infections; a doctor should determine the appropriate treatment based on the specific type of bacteria involved.  This medication might also be used for other skin conditions at the discretion of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary depending on the specific formulation (cream, ointment), the severity of the condition, and the age and weight of the patient.  Always follow the prescription instructions precisely.  Generally, a thin layer of the cream or ointment is applied to the affected area two to three times daily.  For children, the dosage is usually lower and determined by a physician.  IV administration is not applicable for this medication as it is a topical treatment.  Do not apply to large areas of skin or under occlusive dressings (bandages) unless specifically instructed to do so by a doctor, as this can increase the absorption of the medication and the risk of side effects.  Always wash your hands thoroughly before and after applying the medication.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Burning, stinging, or itching at the application site; skin thinning; skin discoloration; increased hair growth (hirsutism); stretch marks (striae).
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing); skin infections; worsening of existing skin conditions; systemic absorption of corticosteroids (leading to symptoms like Cushing's syndrome in rare cases).  *Note:* Systemic absorption is much less likely with topical application than with oral or injected corticosteroids.


### How it Works

Fluocinolone acetonide, a potent corticosteroid, works by binding to receptors within skin cells, reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune response that contributes to skin redness, swelling, itching, and discomfort. Neomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis, preventing bacterial growth and ultimately eradicating the infection.  The combined effect tackles both the inflammatory aspect and the bacterial infection of the skin condition.
