# Fibrinogen
### Generic Name
Fibrinogen

### Usage
Fibrinogen (factor I) is a crucial glycoprotein primarily used to treat acute bleeding episodes in individuals with congenital fibrinogen deficiency. This deficiency encompasses conditions like afibrinogenemia (complete absence of fibrinogen) and hypofibrinogenemia (abnormally low levels of fibrinogen).  Essentially, it's a replacement therapy to help the body clot blood effectively when the body isn't producing enough fibrinogen on its own.  It is *not* indicated for the treatment of dysfibrinogenemia (where the fibrinogen is present but functionally abnormal).

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Dosage, treatment duration, and administration frequency are tailored to the patient's bleeding severity, laboratory results (specifically fibrinogen levels), and overall clinical condition.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate regimen.

**Adults (Congenital Fibrinogen Deficiency, Hemorrhage):**

* **Unknown Baseline Fibrinogen Level:**  Intravenous (IV) administration of 70 mg/kg of body weight is typically given.  The goal is to maintain a fibrinogen level of 100 mg/dL until bleeding stops (hemostasis is achieved).

* **Known Baseline Fibrinogen Level:**  The dose is calculated using a formula to reach the target plasma fibrinogen level. This formula considers the patient's measured fibrinogen level, target level (based on bleeding severity), and body weight:  `Dose = (target level in mg/dL - measured level in mg/dL) / 1.7 (mg/dL per mg/kg body weight)`

**Children (Congenital Fibrinogen Deficiency, Hemorrhage):** The dosage is generally the same as for adults, determined on a case-by-case basis by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a physician for guidance in these situations.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (frequency not defined by manufacturer):

* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Arterial thrombosis (blood clot in an artery)
* Deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in a deep vein)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions, ranging from mild hives to severe anaphylaxis)
* Headache
* Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung)
* Fever
* Shivering


Less common but serious side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any adverse effects.


### How it Works

Fibrinogen is a crucial clotting factor.  When a blood vessel is injured, a complex process called the coagulation cascade is triggered.  In this cascade, thrombin (an enzyme) converts fibrinogen into fibrin.  Fibrin forms a mesh-like structure that traps blood cells, creating a blood clot and stopping bleeding. Fibrinogen's role is as a precursor to this essential clotting protein.  Administering fibrinogen directly replaces the deficient clotting factor, facilitating proper clot formation and hemostasis.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fibrinogen is contraindicated in individuals with a known history of severe systemic or anaphylactic reactions to fibrinogen, human plasma-derived products, or any components of the formulation.

* **Increased Risk:** Patients receiving fibrinogen have an increased risk of thrombotic events (blood clots), hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), and transmission of infectious agents (though rigorous screening of donors minimizes this risk).

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Fibrinogen is categorized as pregnancy Category C, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are not fully known. Use during pregnancy should only occur if clearly necessary.  It's also unknown if fibrinogen is excreted in breast milk; caution is advised during breastfeeding.

* **General Precautions:** Administer fibrinogen within 24 hours of reconstitution.  It should be administered through a separate injection site and not mixed with other medications or intravenous solutions.  Infusion should be slow (no more than 5 mL/min).

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Fibrinogen administered?** A: Fibrinogen is administered intravenously (IV) via slow injection.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The effect is relatively rapid, helping to control bleeding quickly. However, the exact timeframe depends on the individual and the severity of the bleeding.

* **Q: How is it stored?** A: Storage instructions will be provided with the specific medication; typically, it requires refrigeration.

* **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?** A: While not comprehensively listed by the manufacturer, there is a potential for interaction with anticoagulants (blood thinners), which should be discussed with your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects.
