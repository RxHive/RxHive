# Flutemetamol F 18
### Generic Name
Flutemetamol F 18

### Usage
Flutemetamol F 18 is a radioactive diagnostic agent used in positron emission tomography (PET) scans of the brain.  Its primary use is to help estimate the density of beta-amyloid neuritic plaques in adults experiencing cognitive impairment. This helps in the evaluation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other potential causes of cognitive decline.  It's important to understand that Flutemetamol F 18 is used as an *adjunct* to other diagnostic tests; it doesn't provide a diagnosis on its own.

### Dosage
**Brain Imaging (Adults):**  The usual dose is 5 mCi (185 MBq), with a maximum mass dose of 20 mcg.  It's administered intravenously (IV) as a single bolus injection within 40 seconds, using a total volume of 10 mL or less, followed by a 5-15 mL saline flush.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Flutemetamol F 18 have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended based on hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment according to the manufacturer's labeling.


### Side Effects
**Common (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Flushing
* Increased blood pressure
* Nausea

**Less Common (<1%):**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (including flushing, shortness of breath, chest pressure)


If you experience any adverse effects, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Flutemetamol F 18 is a radioactive tracer that crosses the blood-brain barrier.  Areas of the brain with a high density of beta-amyloid plaques retain more of the tracer.  By imaging the distribution of Flutemetamol F 18 in the brain, the PET scan provides a visual representation of the amyloid plaque density, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.  The lower the cerebral perfusion, the higher the Flutemetamol F-18 level in the brain.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Flutemetamol F 18 is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, including polysorbate 80.

**Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions and malignancy due to radiation exposure.  Before using Flutemetamol F 18 in women of reproductive potential, pregnancy status must be evaluated.  All radiopharmaceuticals have the potential to cause fetal harm, so elective procedures should be delayed until after delivery.  The excretion of Flutemetamol F 18 in breast milk is unknown; discarding breast milk for 24 hours post-administration is recommended to minimize infant exposure.  Elective procedures should be delayed until breastfeeding ceases.

**General Considerations:**  Appropriate precautions should be taken for handling, disposal, and minimizing exposure to patients and healthcare personnel.  Patients should be encouraged to increase fluid intake before and after administration to reduce bladder radiation exposure and void frequently. A positive scan doesn't confirm a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or other cognitive disorders.  The scan provides an estimate of amyloid plaque density, and clinical information is crucial for accurate diagnosis.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to get the results of a Flutemetamol F 18 PET scan?**  A:  The time it takes to get the results will vary, depending on the imaging center's workflow and the radiologist's interpretation.
* **Q: Is Flutemetamol F 18 safe?** A: Like all medications, Flutemetamol F 18 carries potential risks.  The benefits of the scan must be weighed against the risks of radiation exposure and potential side effects.  A healthcare professional can address any specific concerns.
* **Q: How is Flutemetamol F 18 administered?** A: It's given intravenously as a single injection.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unusual symptoms after the scan.
* **Q: Does a positive scan confirm Alzheimer's disease?** A: No.  A positive scan indicates the presence of amyloid plaques, a characteristic of Alzheimer's, but further clinical evaluation is necessary for diagnosis.  The scan is just one piece of the diagnostic puzzle.
