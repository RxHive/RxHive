# Flortaucipir F18
### Generic Name
Flortaucipir F18

### Usage
Flortaucipir F18 is a radioactive diagnostic agent used in positron emission tomography (PET) scans of the brain. Its primary purpose is to help estimate the density and distribution of aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are undergoing evaluation for Alzheimer's disease (AD).  It helps visualize the tau protein, a hallmark of Alzheimer's, allowing for a better understanding of the disease's progression and severity.  It's important to note that Flortaucipir F18 is *not* indicated for evaluating patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

### Dosage
The recommended dose for adults is 10 mCi (370 MBq), administered as a single intravenous bolus injection in a volume of 10 mL or less. Imaging typically begins approximately 80 minutes after injection.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.  The safety and effectiveness of Flortaucipir F18 in pediatric patients have not been established.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include headache and pain at the injection site.  Less common side effects (less than 1%) can include increased blood pressure.  If you experience any adverse effects, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Flortaucipir F18 works by binding to aggregated tau protein.  In Alzheimer's disease, tau proteins clump together to form NFTs, a key characteristic of the disease.  Flortaucipir F18's ability to bind to these aggregated tau proteins allows it to be visualized on a PET scan, highlighting areas of the brain affected by this abnormal protein accumulation.  While it primarily binds to aggregated tau, it has also been shown to have low-affinity binding to monoamine oxidase-A and -B, which may contribute to some off-target binding.

### Precautions
While no specific contraindications are listed, it is crucial to be aware of potential risks.  There's an increased risk of misdiagnosis in patients evaluated for Alzheimer's disease, particularly concerning misdiagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).  As with all radiopharmaceuticals, Flortaucipir F18 carries the potential for fetal harm, depending on the stage of fetal development and the radiation dose.  Breastfeeding should be avoided for 4 hours after administration to minimize radiation exposure to the infant.  Proper safety measures, including the use of waterproof gloves and shielding, should be followed during handling and administration of this radioactive substance.  All healthcare professionals involved should be appropriately trained and experienced.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the PET scan take after injection?**  A: Imaging usually begins about 80 minutes after the intravenous injection.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, even minor ones, to your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

* **Q: Is Flortaucipir F18 safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  Flortaucipir F18 has the potential to harm a developing fetus.  Breastfeeding should be avoided for 4 hours after administration.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before undergoing the scan if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

* **Q:  Can Flortaucipir F18 diagnose other conditions besides Alzheimer's?** A: No, it's specifically indicated for estimating tau NFTs in patients undergoing evaluation for Alzheimer's disease and is not used for diagnosing other conditions.

* **Q: How is Flortaucipir F18 stored?** A:  This medication is a radioactive substance and requires specialized handling and storage according to regulatory guidelines.  Specific storage instructions will be provided by the facility administering the medication.  Do not attempt to handle or store this medication outside of a properly equipped medical facility.
