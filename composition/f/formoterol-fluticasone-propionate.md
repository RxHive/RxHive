# Formoterol + Fluticasone Propionate

**Generic Name:** Formoterol fumarate and fluticasone propionate

**Usage:**

Formoterol fumarate and fluticasone propionate is a combination inhaler used to prevent and treat symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's specifically for people whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by other medications.  It's *not* for relieving sudden asthma attacks (use a fast-acting reliever inhaler for that).  The fluticasone propionate component reduces inflammation in the airways, while the formoterol fumarate component relaxes the muscles in the airways, making breathing easier.  The specific usage instructions will vary based on the doctor's prescription and the brand name.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Throat irritation:**  A common side effect due to the inhaler itself.
* **Headache:**
* **Cough:**
* **Sore throat:**
* **Muscle aches:**
* **Yeast infection (thrush) in the mouth or throat:**  Rinsing the mouth after each use can help prevent this.
* **Hoarseness:**


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Increased risk of pneumonia:**  Especially in older adults with COPD.
* **Increased risk of bone loss (osteoporosis):** Particularly with long-term use;  discuss this with your doctor.
* **Increased blood sugar levels:**  Monitor blood sugar if you have diabetes.
* **Eye problems (glaucoma, cataracts):**
* **Paradoxically increased wheezing or shortness of breath:** In rare cases.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like hives, swelling of the face or throat, or difficulty breathing.

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list.

**How it Works:**

This medication is a combination of two different types of drugs:

* **Fluticasone propionate (corticosteroid):** This is an anti-inflammatory drug that works by reducing swelling and irritation in the airways. This prevents the airways from becoming narrow and reducing airflow.

* **Formoterol fumarate (long-acting beta2-agonist):** This is a bronchodilator.  It relaxes the muscles around the airways, making them wider and easier to breathe through.  This provides quick relief and long-term prevention of bronchospasm.

By combining these two medications, the inhaler provides both quick relief and long-term control of asthma and COPD symptoms.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I use this for acute asthma attacks?** No.  This is a preventative medication and should not be used to treat sudden asthma attacks. Use a fast-acting reliever inhaler like albuterol (salbutamol) for those.

* **How long does it take to work?**  The bronchodilator (formoterol) works quickly, usually within a few minutes.  The anti-inflammatory effects (fluticasone) take longer, usually several days or weeks to reach their full effect.

* **Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** No.  Stopping suddenly can worsen your condition.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for stopping the medication.

* **What if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.

* **Can I use this medication while pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
