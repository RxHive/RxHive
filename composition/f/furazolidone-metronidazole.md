# Furazolidone + Metronidazole
### Generic Name
Furazolidone + Metronidazole Combination

**Note:**  This information is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice. Always consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition.  Furazolidone + Metronidazole combination is not a standard, pre-packaged formulation readily available in many countries. The information below reflects the individual properties of each drug and their potential combined use as prescribed by a physician, acknowledging the complexities of such a combination.


### Usage

This combination of Furazolidone and Metronidazole is sometimes used to treat specific infections where the synergistic effects of both drugs are beneficial.  It is *not* a standard, readily available combination.  Each drug addresses infections differently:

* **Furazolidone:** Primarily used as an antimicrobial agent, effective against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as some protozoa. It’s often used in cases of intestinal infections.  Its use has diminished due to the emergence of resistant strains.

* **Metronidazole:** A broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against various anaerobic bacteria, some protozoa (like *Giardia lamblia* and *Entamoeba histolytica*), and some anaerobic protozoa. It's frequently used in the treatment of various infections, including those affecting the gastrointestinal tract, vagina, and skin.

A physician might prescribe this combination in cases of severe or complex infections where the individual strengths of both drugs are needed to overcome resistance or treat a mixed infection involving both bacteria and protozoa.  This is typically done on a case-by-case basis, not with a standard pre-mixed product.


### Dosage

**There is no standard dosage for a pre-mixed Furazolidone + Metronidazole combination.** The dosage for each drug would be determined individually by a physician based on factors like the specific infection, the patient's age, weight, overall health, and the severity of the infection.  Dosage information below refers to *individual* drug use and should *not* be interpreted as a combined regimen without direct physician instruction.

* **Furazolidone:** Dosage varies significantly depending on the indication and the patient's condition. It's typically administered orally.  A doctor would determine the precise dose and duration of treatment.

* **Metronidazole:** Dosage also varies depending on the infection being treated and the patient's characteristics.  It can be administered orally, intravenously (IV), or topically (for certain skin infections).  Again, a physician would determine the exact dosage and frequency.

**Children's dosage:** Pediatric dosages for both Furazolidone and Metronidazole are strictly determined by a healthcare professional based on weight and specific infection.


### Side Effects

**Furazolidone:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Peripheral neuropathy (in rare cases with prolonged use)

**Metronidazole:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Metallic taste in the mouth
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Darkened urine
* Seizures (rare, especially in patients with pre-existing neurological conditions)


**Serious (but less common) side effects for both drugs:**  These require immediate medical attention.  Consult your doctor if you experience anything unusual or concerning.

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Liver damage
* Blood disorders
* Neurotoxicity


### How it Works

* **Furazolidone:** Interferes with bacterial protein synthesis and interferes with the bacterial cell’s energy production. This leads to cell death and inhibits further bacterial growth.

* **Metronidazole:**  Once inside the bacteria or protozoa, it’s converted to a cytotoxic agent that damages the DNA of the microorganism, leading to its death.  This mechanism is particularly effective against anaerobic organisms.



### Precautions

* **Furazolidone:**  Should be used cautiously in patients with liver or kidney disease. It can interact with many other drugs; careful monitoring is essential if used concurrently with other medications.  It's contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency due to the risk of hemolytic anemia.

* **Metronidazole:** Should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy.  It can interact with alcohol, leading to a disulfiram-like reaction (nausea, vomiting, flushing).  It’s also best to avoid alcohol for a few days after stopping the medication.  It can interfere with some lab tests.

Both drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of neurological disorders or blood disorders.  Pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children should only use these medications under strict medical supervision.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this combination without a doctor's prescription?** A: No.  This combination is not a standard over-the-counter medicine and should only be taken under a doctor's supervision.

* **Q: How should I store Furazolidone and Metronidazole?** A: Store them as directed on the label, usually in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  Do not double up on doses without medical advice.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of taking these drugs?** A:  Long-term effects are rare, but prolonged use of either drug can lead to problems such as peripheral neuropathy (Furazolidone) or other complications.  Always follow your doctor’s prescribed course of treatment.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking these medications?** A: No, alcohol should be avoided, particularly with Metronidazole.
