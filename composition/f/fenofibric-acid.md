# Fenofibric Acid
### Generic Name
Fenofibric Acid

### Usage

Fenofibric acid is a medication belonging to the fibric acid derivative class. Its primary use is as an adjunct to diet in managing certain lipid disorders.  Specifically, it's used to treat:

* **Severe hypertriglyceridemia:** This condition involves very high levels of triglycerides in the blood, a type of fat that can increase the risk of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and cardiovascular disease. Fenofibric acid helps lower these elevated triglyceride levels.

* **Mixed dyslipidemia:** This refers to a combination of abnormal lipid levels, including high triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ("good" cholesterol).  Fenofibric acid helps improve this lipid profile.

* **Hypercholesterolemia (High Cholesterol) in specific circumstances:** While not its primary indication, fenofibric acid may be used in conjunction with statin therapy for patients at high cardiovascular risk who aren't achieving adequate cholesterol control with statins alone, or when statins are contraindicated or poorly tolerated.


### Dosage

Dosage of fenofibric acid varies depending on the specific formulation (micronized, non-micronized, improved bioavailability), the severity of the condition, and the patient's renal function.  Always follow the healthcare provider's prescribed dosage and instructions.  There is no established safe and effective dosage for children.

**Adults:**

Dosage regimens vary widely depending on the formulation used. A physician will determine the appropriate dosage and formulation based on individual patient needs and response.  Common regimens include:

* **Standard micronized formulation:** 67 mg three times daily (TID) or 200 mg once daily (OD), with potential adjustments up or down based on response.
* **Non-micronized formulation:** 200-300 mg/day in divided doses, with potential adjustments up to 400 mg/day based on response.
* **Improved bioavailability formulation:** 40-160 mg once daily (OD).


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Fenofibric acid is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on creatinine clearance (CrCl).  Consult a healthcare provider for specific guidance as dosage reduction or avoidance of the medication may be necessary.
* **Geriatric Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in >1% of patients):**

* Increased levels of liver enzymes (transaminases)
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Constipation
* Dizziness
* Muscle pain (myalgia)
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Skin rash
* Upper respiratory tract infections


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle breakdown)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Gallstones (cholelithiasis)
* Liver damage (hepatitis)
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)


**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Fenofibric acid works primarily by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-Î±).  This activation leads to several beneficial effects on lipid metabolism:

* **Increased lipoprotein lipase activity:** This enzyme breaks down triglycerides in the blood, leading to lower triglyceride levels.
* **Decreased production of apolipoprotein CIII:** This protein inhibits the breakdown of triglycerides.  By reducing its production, fenofibric acid further contributes to lower triglyceride levels.
* **Increased production of apolipoproteins AI and AII:** These proteins are involved in the formation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ("good" cholesterol).  Increased HDL levels can help protect against cardiovascular disease.


This combined effect results in a decrease in triglyceride levels, an increase in HDL cholesterol, and often a decrease in LDL cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol) levels, ultimately improving the overall lipid profile.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fenofibric acid is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease, severe renal impairment, pre-existing gallbladder disease, and those who are breastfeeding.  It should also be avoided in individuals with hypersensitivity to fenofibric acid or any component of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** Fenofibric acid can interact with several other medications, including statins, other lipid-lowering drugs, anticoagulants (like warfarin), and certain immunosuppressants.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Fenofibric acid is a Pregnancy Category C drug, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been fully established.  It's contraindicated during breastfeeding.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Renal function should be carefully monitored in older adults, as dosage adjustments may be needed.
* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs), lipid profile, and complete blood count (CBC) is essential while taking fenofibric acid.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take fenofibric acid with other medications?**

**A:**  It's essential to discuss all your medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, with your doctor before starting fenofibric acid. Some medications can interact negatively with it.


**Q: How should I store fenofibric acid?**

**A:** Store fenofibric acid as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

**A:** If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.


**Q: How long will it take to see results?**

**A:**  The improvement in lipid levels varies from person to person, and it may take several weeks or months to see significant changes. Regular monitoring is essential to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.


**Q: Can fenofibric acid cause muscle pain?**

**A:** Muscle pain (myalgia) is a potential side effect.  Report any muscle pain or weakness to your doctor immediately, especially if it's severe.
