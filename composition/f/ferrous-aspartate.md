# Ferrous Aspartate
### Generic Name
Ferrous Aspartate

### Usage
Ferrous aspartate is an iron supplement used to treat iron deficiency anemia.  Iron deficiency anemia occurs when the body doesn't have enough iron to produce sufficient hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.  This deficiency leads to fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and other symptoms. Ferrous aspartate is a form of iron that's relatively well-absorbed by the body, making it an effective treatment option. While its primary use is treating iron deficiency anemia, it may also be used to prevent iron deficiency in individuals at risk, such as pregnant women or those with certain dietary restrictions.

### Dosage
The dosage of ferrous aspartate varies depending on the individual's age, the severity of the iron deficiency, and the specific formulation of the medication.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  

* **Adults:**  The typical adult dose ranges from 30 to 200 mg of elemental iron per day, often divided into multiple doses.  This is usually administered orally as a tablet or capsule.  The specific amount of ferrous aspartate needed to provide this elemental iron will vary based on the product; check the label for the elemental iron content.

* **Children:** The dosage for children is determined by their age and weight, and it's crucial to follow the recommendations provided by their pediatrician.  Never give a child an adult dose of ferrous aspartate.  Liquid formulations are often available for easier administration to children.

* **Different Forms:** Ferrous aspartate is available in different forms, including tablets, capsules, and sometimes liquids.  Always follow the instructions provided with your specific medication.

* **Administration:** Ferrous aspartate is typically taken orally with or without food.  However, taking it with food may reduce stomach upset in some individuals.  It's essential to take the medication as directed by your physician.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of ferrous aspartate include:

* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Stomach upset
* Dark stools (this is a normal effect)

Less common, but more serious side effects, warrant immediate medical attention and include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Severe stomach pain
* Bloody or black stools


If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Ferrous aspartate works by providing the body with readily absorbable iron. Iron is a crucial component of hemoglobin, the protein responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. When iron levels are low, the body cannot produce enough hemoglobin, resulting in anemia. By supplementing with ferrous aspartate, the body receives the iron it needs to increase hemoglobin production, improving oxygen-carrying capacity and alleviating the symptoms of iron deficiency anemia.  The aspartate portion of the molecule helps improve the absorption of iron in the gastrointestinal tract.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Ferrous aspartate is contraindicated in individuals with certain conditions like hemochromatosis (iron overload), hemosiderosis (iron deposits in tissues), and some types of anemia not caused by iron deficiency.

* **Drug Interactions:** Ferrous aspartate can interact with certain medications, including antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones), antacids, and some thyroid medications.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While iron is essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding, the dosage of ferrous aspartate should be determined by a doctor.  Self-medicating during these periods is not recommended.

* **Older Adults:** Older adults may have reduced iron absorption, so their doctor might need to adjust the dosage accordingly.

* **Children:**  Always consult a pediatrician before giving ferrous aspartate to a child.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take ferrous aspartate with food?** A: While not strictly necessary, taking it with food may help reduce stomach upset for some individuals.
