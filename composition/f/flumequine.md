# Flumequine
### Generic Name
Flumequine

### Usage
Flumequine is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic.  It's important to note that **flumequine is no longer marketed in many countries, including the United States, for human use.**  Its use was primarily limited to treating certain bacterial infections in the urinary tract. In some regions, it had a very limited role in human medicine.  Historically, its veterinary use was more prevalent, focusing on treating enteric (intestinal) infections in animals.  Given its discontinued status for human use, information below should be considered historical and not a guide for current treatment.

### Dosage
The dosage of flumequine varied depending on the specific infection being treated.  In the past, for urinary tract infections, oral dosages ranged from 400 mg twice daily (BID) to 400 mg three times daily (TID) for at least 10 days.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment were not specifically defined in manufacturer's labeling, warranting caution in such cases.  Information on pediatric dosage is not readily available due to the drug's discontinued use in humans.

### Side Effects
Flumequine, like other fluoroquinolones, could cause several side effects, although the frequency of these is not consistently defined in available historical information.  These could include:

*   Nervous system: Headache, dizziness, insomnia, nervousness, confusion
*   Gastrointestinal: Epigastric and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting
*   Hepatic: Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
*   Dermatologic: Rashes, erythema (redness)
*   Immunologic:  Anaphylactic shock (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
*   Ophthalmic: Bilateral symmetrical macular bullae (blisters on the macula of the eye—a serious side effect)


**It is crucial to note that any serious side effects require immediate medical attention.**

### How it Works
Flumequine is a bactericidal antibiotic.  This means it kills bacteria, unlike bacteriostatic antibiotics, which only inhibit their growth. It works by interfering with the replication of bacterial DNA.  Specifically, it inhibits DNA gyrase, an enzyme essential for bacterial DNA supercoiling.  By disrupting this process, flumequine prevents the bacteria from synthesizing nucleic acids necessary for their growth and survival.

### Precautions
Flumequine was contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to flumequine itself.  Caution was advised in patients with hypersensitivity to other fluoroquinolones, renal or CNS (central nervous system) impairment, or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.  Its use during pregnancy and lactation was not well-established, and therefore caution was warranted.  Interactions with other medications were also a concern, including interactions that might affect blood glucose levels or the effectiveness of other drugs.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Is flumequine still available?** A: No, flumequine is no longer widely marketed for human use in many countries.

*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop taking flumequine and seek immediate medical attention, particularly for severe side effects.

*   **Q: Can I take flumequine with other medications?** A:  Flumequine could interact with several other drugs; consulting a healthcare professional about potential interactions before taking it with other medications is essential—however, given its discontinued use, this is no longer relevant.

*   **Q: How should I store flumequine?** A: Information on storage is not currently relevant given the discontinuation of the drug for human use.
