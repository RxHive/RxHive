# Fexofenadine + Phenylephrine

**Generic Name:** Fexofenadine and Phenylephrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to temporarily relieve symptoms of allergies and the common cold.  Fexofenadine is an antihistamine that reduces allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and hives. Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving nasal congestion.  It's typically used for short-term relief of symptoms.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Common:** Drowsiness, headache, dizziness, nervousness, insomnia, nausea, constipation, dry mouth.
* **Less Common but more serious:**  Rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, difficulty urinating.  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing) are also possible, though rare.

**Important Note:** This list is not exhaustive. Consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects and to discuss any concerns.


**How it Works:**

* **Fexofenadine:** This is a non-sedating antihistamine.  It works by blocking histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking histamine, fexofenadine reduces the allergic symptoms.

* **Phenylephrine:** This is a sympathomimetic decongestant. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages.  This reduces swelling and congestion, making it easier to breathe.
