# Fludeoxyglucose F 18
### Generic Name
Fludeoxyglucose F 18

### Usage

Fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) is a radioactive substance used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans.  It's not a treatment itself, but a diagnostic tool.  Primarily, it helps visualize areas of the body with increased glucose metabolism, which is often a characteristic of cancerous tumors.  Therefore, FDG-PET scans are frequently used in oncology to:

* **Detect cancer:** Identify the presence, location, and size of tumors, helping in diagnosis and staging.
* **Assess cancer response to treatment:** Monitor the effectiveness of therapies like chemotherapy or radiotherapy by observing changes in glucose metabolism within tumors.
* **Identify cancer recurrence:** Detect the reappearance of cancer after initial treatment.

Beyond oncology, FDG-PET also finds application in:

* **Cardiology:**  Evaluating myocardial perfusion (blood flow to the heart muscle) and identifying areas of reversible damage following a heart attack.
* **Neurology:**  Detecting areas of abnormal brain activity associated with epilepsy or other neurological disorders.

It's crucial to remember that FDG-PET is an imaging technique; it's used to guide treatment decisions, not as a stand-alone treatment for any condition.

### Dosage

The dosage of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 varies depending on the patient's weight, the specific indication (oncology, cardiology, or neurology), and the imaging equipment used.  It's always administered intravenously (IV).

* **Adults (Oncology, Cardiology, Neurology):**  A typical dose ranges from 5 to 10 millicuries (mCi) or 185 to 370 megabecquerels (MBq) for a 70 kg individual.  The exact dose is determined by the physician based on individual patient factors.

* **Pediatrics (Neurology):**  A common dose is 2.6 mCi (96.2 MBq).  However, there isn't a universally established method for dose adjustment based on a child's weight or size.

The physician will determine the appropriate dosage in consultation with the radiology department and based on the specific imaging protocol.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not established.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) are generally mild and transient.

* **Endocrine and Metabolic:** Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) or hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).

Less frequent side effects (1-10% of patients):

* **Cardiovascular:** Transient hypotension (temporary low blood pressure).
* **Hepatic:** A temporary elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (a liver enzyme).

Serious side effects are rare.  Any unusual symptoms or prolonged effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is a radioactive tracer that mimics glucose, the primary energy source for cells.  Cancer cells often exhibit increased glucose uptake and metabolism compared to normal cells.

Once injected, FDG is transported into cells via glucose transporters.  Inside the cell, it's phosphorylated (a chemical modification) and becomes trapped, as it cannot easily leave the cell.  Areas with high FDG concentration, detected by the PET scanner, indicate increased glucose metabolism, often suggesting cancerous or other metabolically active tissue.  The images produced help visualize these areas.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any component of the formulation.

* **Increased Risk:** Patients with blood glucose abnormalities have an increased risk of complications.  Blood glucose levels are often carefully monitored before administration.  For oncology and neurology patients, fasting may be required before the procedure to optimize image quality. For cardiology patients, consuming glucose may be needed.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** FDG crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. While long-term effects on the fetus are unknown, precautions are taken to minimize radiation exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding is often temporarily interrupted following administration, and specific recommendations will be provided by the healthcare team.

* **Radiation Safety:** Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is radioactive. Special handling and disposal procedures are necessary to minimize radiation exposure to healthcare personnel and the patient.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the procedure take?**  A: The injection is quick, but the scan itself can last 30-60 minutes or longer, depending on the area being imaged.

* **Q: What should I do before the scan?** A:  Your doctor will provide specific instructions, but generally, this may include fasting and adequate hydration.

* **Q: Are there any dietary restrictions after the scan?** A:  Usually, there are no dietary restrictions after the scan.

* **Q: Is the radiation from FDG dangerous?** A: The amount of radiation used is relatively low and considered safe. However, appropriate safety protocols are followed to minimize exposure.

* **Q: When will I get the results?** A: The time to get results will vary depending on the healthcare facility, but the radiologist will interpret the images and provide a report to the referring physician, who will then discuss the findings with the patient.
