# Fluticasone Furoate + Azelastine

**Generic Name:** Fluticasone Furoate/Azelastine Nasal Spray

**Usage:**

Fluticasone furoate/azelastine nasal spray is used to relieve symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in adults and children 12 years of age and older.  These symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, itchy/watery eyes, and congestion. It's a combination medication, meaning it contains two active ingredients that work in different ways to address allergy symptoms.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Nose and throat:** Nosebleeds, nose irritation, throat irritation, sore throat, unpleasant taste.
* **Other:** Headache, dizziness.

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention.  These include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
* Increased risk of infection in the nose and throat.
* Eye problems.


**How it Works:**

This combination medication contains two active ingredients:

* **Fluticasone furoate:** This is a corticosteroid (a type of steroid). It works by reducing inflammation in the nasal passages, thereby decreasing swelling and mucus production.  It doesn't treat the underlying allergy but reduces the body's reaction to the allergen.
* **Azelastine:** This is an antihistamine. It blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. Histamine is responsible for many allergy symptoms like sneezing, itching, and runny nose.


By combining these two active ingredients, the medication provides both anti-inflammatory and antihistamine effects, offering broader symptom relief than either ingredient alone.
