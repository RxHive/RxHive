# Fluticasone Furoate + Azelastine
### Generic Name
Fluticasone Furoate + Azelastine

### Usage

Fluticasone furoate + azelastine is a combination nasal spray used to treat seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in adults and children aged 12 years and older.  It combines two active ingredients:

* **Fluticasone furoate:** A corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the nasal passages. This helps to alleviate symptoms like nasal congestion, sneezing, and runny nose by decreasing the swelling and irritation of the nasal lining.  It's a potent anti-inflammatory, working to prevent the allergic response itself.

* **Azelastine:** An antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine is a primary culprit behind many allergy symptoms, particularly sneezing, itching, and runny nose. Azelastine works quickly to alleviate these symptoms.


This combination therapy targets both the inflammatory component and the histamine-mediated symptoms of allergic rhinitis, providing broader symptom relief than either drug alone.  While primarily used for seasonal allergies, it may also offer some benefit in managing perennial allergic rhinitis (allergies present year-round), although this is less commonly the focus of its prescription.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions should always be followed precisely as directed by a physician or pharmacist.  The typical dosage for adults and children 12 years and older is one spray in each nostril once daily.  This is usually administered in the morning.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Children under 12:** This medication is not approved for use in children younger than 12 years old.
* **Missed Dose:** If a dose is missed, administer it as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Form:** This medication is only available as a nasal spray.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Nasal irritation
* Nosebleeds
* Headache
* Bitter or unpleasant taste
* Sneezing


Less common, but more serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention.  These include:

*  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) – characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, and hives.
*  Increased risk of infections (due to immunosuppressive effects of the corticosteroid)


If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to contact a healthcare provider for guidance.


### How it Works

Fluticasone furoate and azelastine work synergistically to control allergy symptoms. Fluticasone furoate, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation in the nasal passages by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators. This decreases nasal congestion and swelling. Azelastine, an antihistamine, blocks the action of histamine, a key chemical responsible for many allergy symptoms such as sneezing, itching, and runny nose.  By combining these two mechanisms, the medication offers comprehensive relief of allergy symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to fluticasone furoate, azelastine, or any component of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** While generally well-tolerated, potential interactions with other medications exist. It’s important to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins, being taken concurrently.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult a doctor before using this medication if pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  The safety profile during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.
* **Elderly:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects. Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on individual health status.
* **Liver or Kidney Disease:**  Patients with impaired liver or kidney function should use caution and potentially require dosage adjustments, based on their physician’s recommendation.



### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?**  A:  While azelastine provides relatively quick relief, the full benefit of fluticasone furoate may take several days to become apparent as inflammation reduces.  Consistent use is crucial for optimal results.

* **Q: Can I use this medication with other allergy medications?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist before using this medication with other allergy medications, as interactions may occur.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the nasal spray at room temperature, away from moisture and extreme temperatures. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I stop taking it when my symptoms improve?** A: Continue using the medication as directed by your doctor even if symptoms improve to prevent relapse.  Do not abruptly discontinue use.

* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally inhale too much?** A: In case of accidental overdose, seek immediate medical attention.
