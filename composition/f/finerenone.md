# Finerenone
### Generic Name
Finerenone

### Usage
Finerenone is a medication primarily used to reduce the risk of kidney disease progression, cardiovascular death, heart attack, and heart failure hospitalization in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D).  Its main purpose is to slow the decline in kidney function and decrease the risk of serious cardiovascular events in this specific patient population.  It achieves this by targeting the mineralocorticoid receptor, a key player in processes that contribute to kidney damage and cardiovascular complications.

### Dosage

**Adults (Chronic Kidney Disease with Type 2 Diabetes):**

* **Initial Dose:** The starting dose depends on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR):
    * eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²: 20 mg once daily (OD)
    * eGFR ≥ 25 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m²: 10 mg OD
    * eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m²:  Finerenone is not recommended.

* **Maintenance Dose:**  The maintenance dose is determined by serum potassium levels, checked four weeks after starting treatment or any dose adjustment, and periodically thereafter.  If potassium levels are consistently above a certain threshold (typically > 5.5 mEq/L), the dose may need to be reduced or temporarily stopped.  Precise adjustments should always be guided by a doctor based on individual patient response and potassium monitoring.

* **Administration:** Finerenone is taken orally. The tablet can be swallowed whole or crushed and mixed with water or applesauce and taken immediately.


**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of finerenone in children haven't been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dose adjustments might be necessary based on liver and kidney function. Patients with mild-to-moderate liver impairment may not require dose adjustments but should have closer monitoring of potassium levels.  Severe liver impairment contraindicates the use of finerenone.  Renal impairment does not necessitate a standard dose alteration; however, initial dosing and adjustments are carefully based on eGFR and potassium levels.

### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) is the most frequent side effect.
* **Other (1-10%):** Hypotension (low blood pressure), Hyponatremia (low sodium levels).
* **Serious (Less Common):** While less frequent, serious side effects can occur.  It's crucial to promptly report any concerning symptoms to a healthcare provider.

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any side effects.

### How it Works

Finerenone is a selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA).  The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a protein inside cells involved in regulating fluid and electrolyte balance, blood pressure, and inflammation.  Aldosterone, a hormone influencing MR, is often overactive in patients with CKD and T2D, contributing to kidney damage and cardiovascular issues.  Finerenone blocks the harmful effects of aldosterone by attaching to and blocking the MR, reducing sodium reabsorption in the kidneys and lessening inflammation in various tissues. By modulating these actions, finerenone helps protect the kidneys and cardiovascular system.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Finerenone is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (certain medications that affect how the body processes finerenone) and those with adrenal insufficiency (a condition affecting hormone production).
* **Interactions:**  The drug interacts with other medications, particularly CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers (substances that alter the metabolism of finerenone). Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided.  Careful monitoring is necessary if finerenone is used with moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.  Your physician should be made aware of all medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Hyperkalemia is a potential risk, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney issues. Regular monitoring of potassium levels is vital.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of finerenone during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. It's generally recommended to avoid finerenone during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take finerenone with other medications?** A:  Discuss all medications and supplements you are taking with your doctor before starting finerenone.  Some medications can interact with finerenone.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, but only if it's still the same day. If you miss a dose and it's the next day, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule.
* **Q: How should I store finerenone?** A:  Store finerenone as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.
