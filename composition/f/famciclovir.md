# Famciclovir
### Generic Name
Famciclovir

### Usage
Famciclovir is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat various infections caused by the herpes viruses.  Its main applications include:

* **Acute Herpes Zoster (Shingles):** Famciclovir effectively shortens the duration and severity of shingles in immunocompetent adults (those with healthy immune systems).  Treatment should ideally begin within 72 hours of symptom onset.

* **Genital Herpes:**  Famciclovir is used to treat both initial and recurrent episodes of genital herpes in immunocompetent adults. It can also be used for suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of outbreaks.

* **Herpes Labialis (Cold Sores):** Famciclovir can treat both initial and recurrent cold sores.  For recurrent episodes, it's most effective when taken at the very first sign of a cold sore (tingling, itching, or burning).

* **Recurrent Orolabial/Genital Herpes Simplex in HIV-infected Adults:** Famciclovir plays a role in managing recurrent herpes infections in adults with HIV, both for treatment of outbreaks and for preventative suppressive therapy.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies depending on the specific condition being treated. Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Acute Herpes Zoster:** 500 mg every 8 hours for 7 days (Start within 72 hours of symptom onset). Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with kidney impairment (see Dosage Adjustments below).

* **Genital Herpes (Initial Episode):** 250 mg three times daily (TID) for 7-10 days.  Treatment might be extended if healing isn't complete after 10 days.

* **Genital Herpes (Recurrence):** 125 mg twice daily (BID) for 5 days, or a single 500mg dose followed by 250mg BID for 2 days.

* **Genital Herpes (Suppressive Therapy):** 250 mg BID.

* **Herpes Labialis (Initial Episode):** 250 mg every 8 hours for 7-10 days.

* **Herpes Labialis (Recurrence):** 1500 mg as a single dose (taken at the first sign of symptoms).

* **Herpes Labialis (Suppressive Therapy):** 250 mg every 12 hours for 12 months.

* **Herpes in HIV-infected Adults (Treatment of Recurrence):** 500 mg every 12 hours for 5-10 days (start within 48 hours of symptom onset).

* **Herpes in HIV-infected Adults (Prevention of Reactivation):** 500 mg every 12 hours.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of famciclovir haven't been established in children under 18 years of age.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired kidney function.  These adjustments depend on the creatinine clearance (CrCl) rate and whether the patient is on hemodialysis.  Consult the prescribing information for detailed guidelines on dose modification based on CrCl levels.  Mild to moderate hepatic impairment typically doesn't require dose adjustment.

### How it Works

Famciclovir is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, penciclovir, in the body. Penciclovir then becomes penciclovir triphosphate, which inhibits the DNA polymerase enzyme crucial for herpes virus replication. By blocking this enzyme, famciclovir prevents the virus from multiplying and spreading, thus helping to control the infection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Famciclovir is contraindicated for individuals with a known hypersensitivity to famciclovir, penciclovir, or any component of the medication.

* **Renal Impairment:** Use caution in patients with kidney problems as famciclovir is primarily eliminated through the kidneys. Dosage adjustments are essential (see Dosage Adjustments above).

* **Hepatic Impairment:** While generally not requiring dose adjustment for mild to moderate impairment, patients with severe liver disease should be monitored closely.

* **Drug Interactions:** Famciclovir can interact with several other medications, including probenecid, raloxifene, tenofovir, pemetrexed, entecavir, and digoxin. Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking. It may also diminish the effectiveness of certain vaccines (zoster and varicella).

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Famciclovir is categorized as pregnancy category B. While generally considered safe, discuss its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding with your doctor to weigh the benefits against potential risks.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking famciclovir?** A:  There's no direct interaction, but alcohol might worsen some side effects like nausea. Consult your doctor if you have concerns.

* **Q: How should I store famciclovir?** A: Store famciclovir at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Does famciclovir cure herpes?** A: No, famciclovir doesn't cure herpes, but it effectively manages symptoms, reduces the frequency and severity of outbreaks, and can prevent future occurrences with suppressive therapy.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking famciclovir when my symptoms improve?** A: No, continue taking the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better.  Stopping early can lead to recurrence or incomplete treatment.
