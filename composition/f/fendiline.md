# Fendiline
### Generic Name
Fendiline

### Usage
Fendiline was a vasodilator used in the treatment of ischemic heart disease.  It worked by improving blood flow to the heart muscle.  However, it's important to note that **Fendiline has been withdrawn from the market** due to safety concerns and is no longer available for prescription.  This information is for educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for use.

### Dosage
Because Fendiline is no longer available, dosage information is provided for historical context only.  Prescribing information varied depending on the specific formulation and the patient's condition.  Dosage was typically determined by a physician based on individual needs and response to treatment.  Different formulations (e.g., tablets, capsules) may have had varying strengths.  **Do not attempt to obtain or use Fendiline.**

### Side Effects
Since Fendiline is no longer available, this list is for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a comprehensive list of all potential side effects.  Reported side effects included:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Constipation
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* **More serious, but less common side effects included liver damage and agranulocytosis (a dangerous decrease in white blood cells).**

If you experienced any adverse effects from a medication in the past, consult a healthcare professional for advice.

### How it Works
Fendiline belonged to a class of drugs known as diphenylalkylamines. It acted as a non-selective calcium channel blocker, meaning it inhibited the influx of calcium ions into heart muscle cells and smooth muscle cells of blood vessels.  This calcium channel blocking action, along with its calmodulin inhibitory properties, led to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing the workload on the heart and improving blood flow to the heart muscle.  This helped alleviate the symptoms of angina (chest pain) associated with ischemic heart disease.

### Precautions
Because Fendiline is no longer marketed, this section is provided for educational purposes.  It is crucial to remember **Fendiline should not be used.**  However, based on historical data, precautions likely included:

* **Contraindications:**  Fendiline was contraindicated in patients with certain pre-existing conditions, which would have been specified in its original prescribing information.  This information is not readily available as the drug is no longer used.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Interactions with other medications were possible and would have been detailed in the original prescribing information.
