# Favipiravir

**Generic Name:** Favipiravir

**Usage:**

Favipiravir is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat influenza (flu) and COVID-19.  Its use in treating COVID-19 is more controversial and its effectiveness is still under evaluation by many medical authorities.  It's important to note that favipiravir is *not* a first-line treatment for either condition in most places, and its use is often reserved for specific situations, such as severe cases where other treatments have failed or are contraindicated.  It may also be used off-label for certain other viral infections in some regions, but this should only be done under strict medical supervision.  The specific usage guidelines vary depending on the country and the prevailing health authority recommendations.

**Side Effects:**

Favipiravir can cause a range of side effects, some mild and some serious. Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash
* Elevated liver enzymes (liver function tests may show abnormalities)

More serious, though less common, side effects can include:

* Severe allergic reactions
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Liver damage
* Gout
* Renal impairment (kidney problems)
* Increased risk of birth defects (teratogenic effects, hence contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding)


It is crucial to report any concerning side effects to a doctor immediately.  The severity and frequency of side effects can vary significantly between individuals.

**How it Works:**

Favipiravir is a nucleoside analog RNA polymerase inhibitor.  This means it interferes with the ability of RNA viruses, like influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), to replicate their genetic material (RNA). By inhibiting RNA polymerase, the virus cannot produce the necessary components for its reproduction, thus slowing down or halting the viral infection.  Its mechanism of action is different from other antiviral drugs, offering a potential alternative in cases of resistance to other medications.

It is not currently considered a first-line treatment by most major health organizations.

* **Is Favipiravir safe?** Favipiravir has potential side effects, some of which can be serious.  It's essential to use it under strict medical supervision and to report any adverse reactions immediately.
