# Favipiravir
### Generic Name
Favipiravir

### Usage
Favipiravir is primarily an antiviral medication used to treat influenza virus infections, particularly when other antiviral agents are ineffective or insufficiently effective.  It's important to note that its use in influenza is primarily licensed in Japan.  While Favipiravir has seen emergency use authorization in some countries (like India) for mild to moderate COVID-19,  updated guidelines (as of 2023) from organizations like the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) recommend against its use for COVID-19 treatment.  Therefore, its current primary clinical application remains focused on influenza.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies depending on the specific indication.  

* **Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 - *Note: This was an emergency use authorization and is no longer recommended by many health organizations*)**: The previously recommended dosage was 1800 mg twice daily (BID) on day one, followed by 800 mg BID for up to 14 days.  This dosage is outdated and should not be used.
* **Novel or re-emerging influenza virus infections (Licensed in Japan):**  The recommended dosage is 1600 mg BID on day one, followed by 600 mg BID for four days, for a total treatment duration of five days. Treatment should begin promptly after the onset of influenza-like symptoms.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of favipiravir in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Favipiravir is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment due to the risk of increased drug levels in the body.

### Side Effects

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed above or any unusual symptoms, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Favipiravir is a pyrazine carboxamide derivative that acts as a nucleotide analog.  Once inside virus-infected cells, it inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza viruses and other RNA viruses. This enzyme is crucial for viral replication.  By inhibiting this enzyme, favipiravir prevents the virus from making copies of itself, thereby limiting the infection.  Furthermore, it's thought to induce lethal mutations in the viral RNA, further impairing the virus's ability to replicate and spread.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Favipiravir is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, severe hepatic or renal impairment, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women.  It is known to be teratogenic (causing birth defects).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Favipiravir can interact with several medications.  For example, concomitant use with pyrazinamide increases blood uric acid levels.  Its interaction with other drugs such as repaglinide, theophylline, famciclovir, and sulindac should be carefully considered.
* **Warnings:**  Favipiravir use carries an increased risk of various serious adverse effects, including shock, anaphylaxis, pneumonia, severe liver damage (hepatitis fulminant), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), acute kidney injury, and neurological or psychiatric symptoms.  It should be used with caution in patients with gout or hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels).

### FAQs
