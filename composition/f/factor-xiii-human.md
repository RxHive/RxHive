# Factor XIII Human
### Generic Name
Factor XIII Human

### Usage
Factor XIII human concentrate is primarily used for preventing bleeding episodes and managing bleeding during and after surgery in adults and children with congenital Factor XIII deficiency.  This deficiency is a rare inherited bleeding disorder where the blood doesn't clot properly due to a lack of Factor XIII, a crucial clotting protein.  The medication is used prophylactically (preventatively) to reduce the risk of spontaneous bleeding and therapeutically to control bleeding that occurs.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Dosage adjustments are based on individual patient response and Factor XIII activity levels, as measured by appropriate laboratory tests (such as the Berichrom activity assay).  Always follow the specific instructions provided by your healthcare professional.

**Adults:**

* **Prophylaxis (prevention of bleeding):**  The initial intravenous (IV) dose is typically 40 units/kg.  Maintenance dosing requires monitoring of Factor XIII activity levels (aiming for 5-20% using a Berichrom activity assay) and adjusting the dose accordingly every 28 days.  Adjustments are made based on whether trough levels are below 5%, within 5-20%, above 20% or above 25%.  Your doctor will guide you on the appropriate adjustment strategy.

* **Perioperative Management (bleeding during or after surgery):** The IV dose ranges from 10-50 units/kg, individualized based on Factor XIII activity levels, the type of surgery, and the patient's response.  If a prophylactic dose has been given recently (within 7 days), an additional dose may not be necessary.  If more time has passed (8-28 days), a partial or full dose may be necessary, depending on the Factor XIII level.

**Children and Adolescents:** Dosage is the same as for adults, adjusted according to weight.

**Dosage Adjustments for Renal or Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with impaired liver or kidney function.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 1% of patients):**

* Headache
* Chills
* Skin rash (erythema, pruritus)
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels
* Hematoma (bruising)
* Hypersensitivity reaction (allergic reaction)
* Joint pain (arthralgia, arthritis)
* Fever


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Development of antibodies against Factor XIII
* Infection
* Acute ischemia (lack of blood flow to tissues)
* Thromboembolism (blood clots in blood vessels)


**Important:** If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Factor XIII (FXIII) is a naturally occurring clotting protein. This medication provides a missing or deficient Factor XIII. In the presence of calcium ions, FXIII is activated to FXIIIa.  Activated FXIIIa cross-links fibrin (a protein involved in blood clot formation) and strengthens the blood clot, making it more stable and preventing excessive bleeding.  Essentially, it helps the blood clot more effectively.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Factor XIII human concentrate is contraindicated in patients with known severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis to human plasma-derived products.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients using this medication may have an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, development of antibodies against Factor XIII, thromboembolic complications (blood clots), and transmission of infectious agents (although the risk is minimized through rigorous screening and processing of the donor plasma).
* **Use with Caution:** Use with caution in patients with risk factors for thrombosis (blood clot formation).  The risk of thrombosis increases with the amount of concentrate administered.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Factor XIII human concentrate is a Category C drug during pregnancy. It should only be used if clearly needed and the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Maternal Factor XIII levels decrease during pregnancy, requiring potential adjustments to dosing frequency. The excretion of Factor XIII in breast milk is unknown, therefore caution is advised while breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Factor XIII human concentrate administered?**
    * **A:** It's given intravenously (IV) by infusion, typically at a rate no faster than 4 mL/min.  The product should be brought to room temperature before infusion and administered through a separate IV line.


* **Q: How is the medication stored?**
    * **A:** Storage instructions will be provided on the product label.  Typically, this involves refrigeration.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
    * **A:** Contact your doctor immediately. Do not attempt to adjust your dosage regimen without consulting your healthcare provider.


* **Q: Are there any potential risks associated with using this medication?**
    * **A:** Yes. Potential risks include allergic reactions, blood clots, and infection.  It's crucial to discuss potential risks and benefits with your healthcare provider before starting treatment.


* **Q: How long will I need to take this medication?**
    * **A:** The duration of treatment depends on your individual condition and response to therapy. Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.
