# Fleroxacin
### Generic Name
Fleroxacin

### Usage
Fleroxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic effective against a range of bacteria.  Its primary use is in treating bacterial infections in several areas of the body. This includes bacterial enteritis (inflammation of the intestines, which can manifest as traveler's diarrhea), skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and lower respiratory tract infections (like acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis).  While it has shown efficacy in these areas, its current availability and approval status vary across different regions; it is currently approved and used in China, but its availability in Europe and the USA is uncertain.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the infection being treated and the route of administration (oral or intravenous).  Always follow your doctor's prescription and instructions.

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Bacterial enteritis (including traveler's diarrhea), skin and soft tissue infections, lower respiratory tract infections:**  Oral: 400 mg once daily.
* **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI):**
    * **Uncomplicated UTI:** Oral: 200-600 mg/day.  The exact dosage and duration will be determined by your physician.
    * **Complicated UTI:** Oral: 200 mg once daily or 400 mg once daily for 10 days; Intravenous: 400 mg single dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for liver impairment; use with caution and under close medical supervision.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of less than 30 mL/min.  Specific adjustments will be determined by your doctor, considering your individual kidney function. For those undergoing hemodialysis, a 400 mg dose at the end of dialysis every other day might be prescribed.  Patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) may receive an 800 mg loading dose initially, followed by a 400 mg daily maintenance dose.

### How it Works

Fleroxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic. This means it kills bacteria.  It achieves this by inhibiting two crucial enzymes in bacteria: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. These enzymes are essential for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. By blocking these enzymes, fleroxacin prevents bacterial cells from multiplying and ultimately leads to their death.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fleroxacin is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to fleroxacin, other quinolones, or any component of the medication.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with a history of psychosis or other psychiatric disorders, photosensitivity, underlying central nervous system (CNS) disorders, renal impairment, or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Fleroxacin is excreted in breast milk, and its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally not recommended unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Consult your doctor for specific guidance.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Fleroxacin may interact with other medications. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
