# Flupenthixol + Escitalopram Oxalate
### Generic Name
Flupenthixol + Escitalopram Oxalate

### Usage

Flupenthixol + Escitalopram Oxalate is a combination medication used to treat depression with psychotic symptoms.  This means it's prescribed for individuals experiencing symptoms of both depression (such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, changes in sleep or appetite) and psychosis (such as hallucinations or delusions).  The combination of flupenthixol, an antipsychotic, and escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI antidepressant), addresses both aspects of the condition.  It's important to note that this is not a first-line treatment for depression; it's generally reserved for cases where depression is accompanied by significant psychotic features that haven't responded adequately to other treatments.

### Dosage

Dosage of Flupenthixol + Escitalopram Oxalate is highly individualized and determined by a healthcare professional based on the patient's specific needs and response to treatment. There is no standard dosage for children.  The medication typically comes in tablet form.  The physician will gradually increase the dosage over time to find the most effective and well-tolerated amount.  It's crucial to follow the doctor's prescribed dosage regimen precisely.  Abruptly stopping the medication can lead to withdrawal symptoms, so any dosage adjustments should always be made under medical supervision.  Specific dosage information is not provided here because it is critical to consult a doctor or pharmacist for personalized instructions.  This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Important:**  Never adjust the dosage without consulting your doctor or pharmacist.  This combination medication is only available via prescription.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

*   Drowsiness or fatigue
*   Nausea
*   Weight changes (gain or loss)
*   Dry mouth
*   Constipation
*   Dizziness
*   Restlessness or anxiety
*   Sexual dysfunction
*   Headaches
*   Blurred vision

Less common but serious side effects include:

*   Serotonin syndrome (a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, and altered mental state)
*   Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) (a rare but serious neurological disorder characterized by muscle rigidity, fever, altered mental status, and autonomic instability)
*   Suicidal thoughts or behavior (though SSRIs can sometimes be associated with increased risk in certain vulnerable individuals, it's critical to understand that this is a complex issue not solely tied to the medication itself.)

If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Flupenthixol works by blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with psychosis, and by reducing its activity, flupenthixol helps to alleviate symptoms like hallucinations and delusions. Escitalopram, on the other hand, selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, another neurotransmitter associated with mood regulation.  By increasing serotonin levels in the brain, escitalopram helps to improve mood and reduce depressive symptoms.  The combination of these two mechanisms of action is intended to comprehensively treat the dual symptoms of depression and psychosis.
