# Foscarnet
### Generic Name
Foscarnet

### Usage

Foscarnet is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat serious viral infections that are resistant to other antiviral drugs. Its main applications are:

* **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in individuals with AIDS:** CMV retinitis is a potentially blinding eye infection common in people with weakened immune systems due to AIDS. Foscarnet is used when other treatments, like ganciclovir, have failed or are unsuitable.

* **Acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in immunocompromised individuals:**  This refers to skin and mucous membrane infections caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) that do not respond to acyclovir, a common antiviral treatment. Foscarnet is a valuable option in these cases, particularly when the patient's immune system is compromised.

Foscarnet also has off-label uses (meaning it's used for conditions not specifically approved by regulatory agencies) including treating CMV infections in other parts of the body (like the gastrointestinal tract) and certain neurological conditions.  However, these off-label applications should only be considered under the guidance of a healthcare professional experienced in managing these complex infections.


### Dosage

Dosage of Foscarnet is highly individualized and depends heavily on the specific condition being treated, the patient's weight, and especially their kidney function (creatinine clearance).  The information below is for general guidance only;  *always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage and instructions.*

**Intravenous (IV) Administration:**  Foscarnet is typically administered intravenously over a specified time (e.g., 1-2 hours depending on the dose).  The drug should never be injected rapidly.

* **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection (Acyclovir-Resistant):**  Dosage varies from 40 mg/kg every 8-12 hours for 14-21 days, or until lesions heal.

* **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis (AIDS Patients):**  
    * **Induction:** 60 mg/kg every 8 hours or 90 mg/kg every 12 hours for 14-21 days.  May be combined with intravitreal injections for severe cases.
    * **Maintenance:** 90-120 mg/kg daily, duration determined by clinical response and CD4 cell count.

* **Other Off-Label Uses (CMV, Neurological):** Dosages vary significantly depending on the specific indication and are usually determined by a specialist.

**Intravitreal Injection:**  In some cases, for eye infections, Foscarnet may be injected directly into the eye (intravitreally).  This procedure is always performed by a qualified ophthalmologist. The dosage for intravitreal injection is significantly lower than for intravenous administration.  The precise dosage and frequency are determined by the physician.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of Foscarnet in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Low levels of potassium, calcium, magnesium, or phosphorus (electrolyte imbalances)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Seizures (often related to electrolyte imbalances)
* Kidney problems (nephrotoxicity), ranging from mild impairment to acute kidney failure
* Anemia
* Low white blood cell count (neutropenia)
* Abnormal heart rhythms (QT prolongation)

*Neurological side effects*:  anxiety, confusion, depression, dizziness, fatigue,  neuropathy, paresthesia, etc.

*Gastrointestinal side effects*: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, etc.

**If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

Foscarnet works by interfering with the ability of viruses like CMV and HSV to replicate. Specifically, it inhibits viral DNA polymerase, an enzyme crucial for viral DNA synthesis.  By blocking this enzyme, Foscarnet prevents the virus from making copies of itself, thus hindering its spread and allowing the body's immune system to control the infection.


### Precautions

* **Kidney Function:** Foscarnet can harm the kidneys (nephrotoxicity).  Regular monitoring of kidney function is vital, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney issues. Dose adjustments are often necessary based on creatinine clearance.

* **Electrolyte Imbalances:**  Foscarnet can cause low levels of various electrolytes (potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus).  Regular blood tests to monitor these levels are essential.  Supplementation may be required.

* **Seizures:**  Electrolyte imbalances can increase the risk of seizures.  Close monitoring and appropriate management of electrolytes are crucial to prevent this complication.

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible.

* **Drug Interactions:** Foscarnet can interact with other medications, particularly those also affecting kidney function.  Discuss all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies) with your doctor.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Foscarnet use during pregnancy is generally avoided unless the benefit outweighs the potential risks to the fetus.  It's unclear whether the drug passes into breast milk, so caution is advised.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take Foscarnet?**  A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the condition, response to therapy, and individual patient factors.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment length.

* **Q: How is Foscarnet stored?** A: Follow the specific storage instructions provided on the medication label.  Generally, it should be stored at room temperature, protected from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor as soon as possible to determine the best course of action.  Never double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Foscarnet?** A:  Alcohol can stress the liver and kidneys. Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor, especially if you have pre-existing liver or kidney problems.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Foscarnet?** A:  Long-term effects are possible, particularly related to kidney function and electrolyte balance.  Regular monitoring is necessary to detect and manage any potential problems.  Discuss long-term concerns with your healthcare provider.
