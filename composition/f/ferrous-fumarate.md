# Ferrous Fumarate
### Generic Name
Ferrous Fumarate

### Usage
Ferrous fumarate is primarily used to treat and prevent iron-deficiency anemia.  This condition arises when the body doesn't have enough iron to produce sufficient hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.  Iron deficiency can lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.  While its primary use focuses on anemia, ferrous fumarate might be used off-label in certain populations to prevent iron deficiency, especially in areas with high prevalence of anemia among women of reproductive age and children.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  The dosages below are expressed in terms of elemental iron. Ferrous fumarate contains 33% elemental iron.  Always refer to your doctor's prescription and the product labeling for the correct dosage based on the specific formulation you are using.

**Adults:**

* **Treatment of Iron-Deficiency Anemia:** 65-200 mg of elemental iron per day, divided into up to three doses.  Alternate-day dosing (e.g., every other day or Monday, Wednesday, Friday) may improve absorption.
* **Prevention of Iron Deficiency (Off-label):**  30-60 mg of elemental iron daily for three consecutive months per year (This is based on World Health Organization guidelines and should only be considered under a doctorâ€™s supervision).


**Children and Adolescents:**

Dosage for children and adolescents varies considerably depending on age and weight.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions. General guidelines, often expressed as milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day), are available but individual needs vary significantly.   Treatment for Iron deficiency usually ranges from 3-6 mg/kg/day in three divided doses, with a maximum daily dose of 200 mg elemental iron. Prevention dosages (off-label) are based on World Health Organization guidelines and will vary significantly based on age and prevalence of anemia in their geographical location.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, for patients with chronic kidney disease (not on dialysis), close monitoring of hemoglobin levels, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation is crucial.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Constipation
* Darkening of stools
* Stomach cramps
* Nausea
* Vomiting


**Less Common Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

**Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Although rare, allergic reactions can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.


If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Ferrous fumarate provides iron in a form that the body can easily absorb.  Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin and myoglobin, proteins responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. By increasing the body's iron stores, ferrous fumarate helps restore normal hemoglobin levels and alleviate symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ferrous fumarate is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to iron salts, hemochromatosis (iron overload), hemosiderosis (excess iron deposition), active peptic ulcers, regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and anemias not caused by iron deficiency.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ferrous fumarate can interact with numerous medications, including but not limited to antacids, tetracyclines, quinolones, and levothyroxine.  Inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Ferrous fumarate can be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding under a doctor's supervision.  However, careful monitoring of iron levels is recommended.
* **Other Precautions:** Do not crush or chew sustained-release formulations. Take with water or juice between meals for best absorption; however, taking it with food may reduce gastrointestinal upset. Avoid taking it with dairy products, tea, or coffee, which can hinder absorption.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take ferrous fumarate with food?** A: While taking it between meals is optimal for absorption, you can take it with food if you experience gastrointestinal discomfort. However, this may reduce absorption slightly.

* **Q: How long should I take ferrous fumarate?** A: Treatment duration varies. Typically, it is continued until hemoglobin levels normalize and for a few months thereafter to replenish iron stores.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store ferrous fumarate?** A: Store it as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and light. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Are there any dietary changes I should make while taking ferrous fumarate?** A: A balanced diet rich in iron-containing foods and foods that enhance iron absorption is beneficial. Your doctor or a registered dietitian can offer personalized dietary advice.
