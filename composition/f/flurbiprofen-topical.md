# Flurbiprofen (Topical)
### Generic Name
Flurbiprofen (Topical)

### Usage
Flurbiprofen topical is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve symptoms associated with various musculoskeletal and joint disorders.  Its primary use is to treat pain and inflammation from conditions such as rheumatic pain, arthritis, soft tissue injuries (sprains, strains, tendinitis), and trauma.  It's applied directly to the affected area to provide localized relief.

### Dosage
**Adults:**  The typical dosage involves applying one 40mg patch to the affected area twice daily (BID).

**Children:**  Flurbiprofen topical should not be used in children under 30 months of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before using this medication if you have liver or kidney problems.

**Administration:** Clean the affected area before applying the patch. Apply the patch to intact, healthy skin, avoiding areas with eczema, rashes, mucous membranes, or broken skin.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Erythema (redness)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin rash

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur.  These include:

* Fever
* Anaphylactoid reactions (especially in individuals with a history of aspirin or NSAID-induced asthma or the aspirin triad â€“ asthma, aspirin intolerance, and rhinitis)
* Severe skin reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)

**If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works
Flurbiprofen is an NSAID that works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, substances that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, flurbiprofen helps alleviate pain and inflammation at the site of application.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to flurbiprofen or any components of the formulation.
* History of aspirin- or NSAID-induced asthma.

**Warnings and Increased Risks:**

* Patients with the aspirin triad (bronchial asthma, aspirin intolerance, and rhinitis) are at increased risk of anaphylactoid reactions.
* There's an increased risk of severe skin reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Use of flurbiprofen topical during pregnancy is not recommended.  The excretion of flurbiprofen in breast milk after topical application is unknown.
