# Fenoterol
### Generic Name
Fenoterol

### Usage

Fenoterol is a bronchodilator primarily used to treat the symptoms of reversible obstructive airway diseases.  Its main application is in relieving acute asthma attacks and bronchospasm. It's also used to alleviate airway narrowing in conditions like chronic obstructive bronchitis and emphysema.  While effective for short-term symptom relief, it's crucial to remember that fenoterol doesn't address the underlying cause of these conditions. It's typically used as a rescue medication for sudden breathing difficulties, not for long-term disease management.  It may also be used to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies significantly depending on the severity of symptoms and the route of administration (inhalation is preferred).

* **Acute bronchospasm (mild to moderate):**
    * **Inhalation (Metered-dose inhaler):** 1 inhalation initially, repeating every 5 minutes as needed, up to a maximum of 8 inhalations per day.
    * **Inhalation (Nebulization):** 0.5–1.25 mg (2–5 drops) every 4 hours as needed, up to a maximum of 2 mg (8 drops) per day.
    * **Oral (Solution/Tablet):** 2.5–5 mg (10–20 drops) three times daily (TID). Oral administration is not the preferred route.

* **Severe asthma exacerbation:** Dosages are significantly higher and administered more frequently under medical supervision. Consult a doctor for specific instructions.

* **Exercise-induced bronchospasm (prevention):**
    * **Inhalation (Metered-dose inhaler):** 1–2 inhalations before exercise, up to a maximum of 8 inhalations per day.
    * **Inhalation (Nebulization):** 0.5 mg (2 drops) before exercise.


**Pediatric Dosage:** Pediatric dosing is significantly more complex and dependent on age and weight.  It's crucial to follow a physician's precise instructions.  Dosages are generally lower than adult doses and are often calculated based on body weight.  Inhalation is the preferred method, with nebulization solution frequently used for younger children.  Oral administration is generally avoided unless inhalation is impossible. Always consult a pediatrician or other qualified healthcare professional for the correct pediatric dosage.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Tremor
* Cough

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Palpitations
* Increased heart rate (tachycardia)
* Changes in blood pressure
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Muscle spasms
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties)

If any of these or other adverse effects occur, contact a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Fenoterol is a beta-2 agonist.  This means it works by binding to beta-2 receptors found in the lungs. This binding triggers a series of reactions that relax the muscles surrounding the airways, leading to bronchodilation (widening of the airways).  This increased airflow allows for easier breathing and relief from symptoms like wheezing and shortness of breath.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fenoterol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenoterol or other sympathomimetic amines, tachyarrhythmias, and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Fenoterol's effects can be altered by several other medications, including beta-blockers, MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and xanthines.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use caution in pregnant or breastfeeding women, patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, hypokalemia, or pheochromocytoma.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Paradoxical Bronchospasm:**  A rare but serious side effect is paradoxical bronchospasm, where breathing difficulties worsen.  If this occurs, discontinue use immediately and seek medical attention.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store fenoterol?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.

* **Q: Can I use fenoterol long-term?** A: Fenoterol is a rescue medication for acute symptoms. It's not typically for long-term use.  Your doctor may prescribe other medications for long-term asthma or COPD management.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for the next dose. Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Is fenoterol habit-forming?** A: No, fenoterol is not considered habit-forming.

* **Q: Can I use fenoterol if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: Use only under strict medical supervision, as it can potentially affect uterine contractility during pregnancy and may be passed into breast milk.
