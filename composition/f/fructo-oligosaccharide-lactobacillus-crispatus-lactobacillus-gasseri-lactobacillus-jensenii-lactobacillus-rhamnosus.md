# Fructo Oligosaccharide + Lactobacillus crispatus + Lactobacillus gasseri + Lactobacillus jensenii + Lactobacillus rhamnosus

**Generic Name:**  Fructooligosaccharide (FOS) + *Lactobacillus crispatus* + *Lactobacillus gasseri* + *Lactobacillus jensenii* + *Lactobacillus rhamnosus*  (This is a combination product, so there isn't one single generic name.)

**Usage:** This combination is typically used as a probiotic supplement aimed at improving gut health and potentially supporting vaginal health.  The fructooligosaccharides (FOS) serve as prebiotics, feeding the beneficial lactobacillus bacteria. The lactobacillus strains are selected for their potential to:

* **Restore vaginal microbiota balance:**  Addressing bacterial vaginosis (BV) or preventing recurrence.  *L. crispatus* is specifically associated with a healthy vaginal environment.
* **Improve gut microbiota diversity and function:** Contributing to better digestion, improved immunity, and potentially reducing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
* **Enhance the immune system:** By stimulating the production of beneficial immune cells in the gut and potentially vagina.

**Note:**  The effectiveness of this specific combination in treating or preventing any specific condition needs to be determined by clinical trials.  Claims regarding specific health benefits should be viewed with caution until supported by robust scientific evidence.

**Side Effects:**  Generally, this combination is considered well-tolerated. However, some individuals may experience mild gastrointestinal side effects such as:

* Gas
* Bloating
* Mild abdominal discomfort
* Diarrhea

These side effects are usually temporary and resolve as the body adjusts to the supplement.  More severe side effects are rare.  If severe side effects occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.

**How it Works:**

* **Prebiotic effect (FOS):** FOS are non-digestible carbohydrates that act as food for beneficial bacteria, specifically the lactobacillus strains in this combination. This promotes their growth and proliferation.
* **Probiotic effect (Lactobacillus strains):** The *Lactobacillus* strains colonize the gut and/or vagina, competing with harmful bacteria for space and resources.  They produce substances that inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria and contribute to a healthier microbial balance.  They may also produce beneficial metabolites that support gut and immune function.
* **Synergistic Effect:** The combination of prebiotics and probiotics is believed to create a synergistic effect, where the prebiotics enhance the growth and activity of the probiotics, leading to a more significant positive impact on gut and/or vaginal health.


**FAQs:**
