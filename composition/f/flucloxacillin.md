# Flucloxacillin
### Generic Name
Flucloxacillin

### Usage

Flucloxacillin, also known as Floxacillin, is a type of antibiotic belonging to the penicillin family.  It's specifically designed to fight against bacteria that produce an enzyme called penicillinase, which can break down many other penicillins, rendering them ineffective.  This makes flucloxacillin particularly useful for infections caused by penicillinase-producing staphylococci (a type of bacteria commonly found on the skin and in the nose).

Flucloxacillin's primary use is in treating infections caused by these bacteria. These infections can affect various parts of the body, including:

* **Skin and soft tissue infections:** Boils, abscesses, cellulitis, and wound infections.
* **Respiratory tract infections:**  Pneumonia, bronchitis (though less common than other antibiotics for this).
* **Bone infections (osteomyelitis):**  Serious infections of the bone and bone marrow.
* **Infections of the heart lining (endocarditis):**  A life-threatening condition.
* **Other infections:**  Flucloxacillin may also be used in treating certain urinary tract infections, meningitis (in some specific situations), and bloodstream infections (septicemia).

It's important to note that flucloxacillin is a *narrow-spectrum* antibiotic, meaning it's effective against a limited range of bacteria. It is not effective against many common bacterial infections, and a doctor should always determine the appropriate antibiotic based on the infecting organism.  Flucloxacillin is also used prophylactically (to prevent infection) in certain surgical procedures, particularly those with a high risk of staphylococcal infection.

### Dosage

Flucloxacillin dosage varies greatly depending on the type of infection, the patient's age, weight, and kidney function.  Always follow a doctor's prescription precisely.  There is no single "standard" dose.  The following information is for general understanding only and should not be used to self-medicate.

**Adults:** Dosages typically range from 250mg to 500mg every six hours orally,  or significantly higher doses administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM) for severe infections, sometimes up to several grams per day divided into multiple doses.  Specific dosages for osteomyelitis and endocarditis are considerably higher and involve longer treatment durations (weeks, rather than days).  The maximum daily dose varies depending on the route of administration and the severity of the infection.

**Children:** Pediatric dosages are weight-based, calculated by a doctor based on the child's weight and the severity of the infection.  Oral formulations may be available as suspensions or liquids for easier administration to children.  Again, precise dosage and regimen will be determined by a physician.

**Different Forms:** Flucloxacillin is available in oral capsules or liquid suspensions, and also in injectable forms (IV or IM).  The choice of form depends on the severity of the infection and the patient's ability to take oral medication.

**Administration Guidelines:** Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Oral medication should be taken with food to reduce the risk of stomach upset.  Injectable forms should only be administered by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Flucloxacillin, like all medications, can cause side effects.  Most are mild and temporary, but some can be serious.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:

* **Common Side Effects:**
    * Nausea
    * Vomiting
    * Diarrhea
    * Stomach upset
    * Rash

* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**
    * Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), including difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or throat, and severe skin reactions
    * Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine)
    * Kidney problems (changes in urine)
    * Blood disorders (decreased white blood cells)
    * *Clostridium difficile* colitis (a serious intestinal infection)


If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works

Flucloxacillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic. It works by interfering with the bacterial cell wall's construction.  Specifically, it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in the bacteria, preventing the bacteria from building and maintaining their cell walls. This disruption leads to cell lysis (rupture) and bacterial death.  Flucloxacillin's resistance to penicillinase makes it effective against bacteria that would otherwise inactivate many other penicillins.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Do not take flucloxacillin if you have a known allergy to penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g., cephalosporins).  Inform your doctor of any allergies before starting treatment.
* **Liver and Kidney Problems:** Flucloxacillin should be used cautiously in individuals with liver or kidney disease. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Discuss flucloxacillin use with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Interactions with Other Medications:** Flucloxacillin can interact with certain medications. Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Other Precautions:**  Monitor for signs of allergic reactions, especially after the first dose.  The drug may contain sodium; this should be considered in individuals on a sodium-restricted diet.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take flucloxacillin with food?** A:  Yes, taking it with food can help reduce stomach upset.

* **Q: How long should I take flucloxacillin?** A:  The duration of treatment varies depending on the infection and your response to treatment.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.

* **Q: Can I stop taking flucloxacillin early if I feel better?** A: No, completing the entire course of antibiotics is crucial to ensure the infection is completely eradicated and to prevent resistance.

* **Q: How should I store flucloxacillin?** A: Store as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What if I experience a severe allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  This is a medical emergency.
