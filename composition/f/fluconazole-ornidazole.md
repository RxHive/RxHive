# Fluconazole + Ornidazole
### Generic Name

Fluconazole + Ornidazole


### Usage

Fluconazole + Ornidazole is a combination medication used to treat various fungal and bacterial infections, particularly those affecting the vagina and gastrointestinal tract.  It's primarily used for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infections) complicated by bacterial vaginosis.  The fluconazole component targets fungal infections caused by *Candida* species, while the ornidazole component tackles bacterial infections, primarily those caused by anaerobic bacteria such as *Gardnerella vaginalis* (a common cause of bacterial vaginosis).  While primarily used for vaginal infections,  in some instances, it might be prescribed off-label for other infections based on a doctor's assessment. It's crucial to understand that this combination is not effective against all types of infections.  A proper diagnosis from a healthcare professional is essential before initiating treatment.


### Dosage

Dosage should always be determined and supervised by a healthcare professional.  There is no standard, universally applicable dosage for this combination drug as it is often formulated and prescribed individually by healthcare providers depending on the specific needs of the patient and the severity of infection.  Dosage will vary based on factors such as the patient's age, weight, overall health, and the specific type and severity of the infection being treated.  

Oral formulations are most common. The usual course of treatment involves a single dose or a short course of medication, but the precise duration and frequency will be determined by the doctor.  

**Important Note:** There is no established pediatric or IV dosage for this specific combination.  Fluconazole and Ornidazole may be given individually via IV in certain cases, but this would require a prescription tailored to the individual patient's needs. Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.



### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Changes in taste
* Vaginal irritation or discharge (though this can also be a sign of ongoing infection)

Less common but serious side effects require immediate medical attention and include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Seizures
* Liver damage (indicated by jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools)
* Blood disorders
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)


If you experience any of these side effects, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.  By disrupting ergosterol production, fluconazole weakens the fungal cell membrane, leading to fungal cell death.  Ornidazole, on the other hand, is an anti-bacterial agent that works by damaging the DNA of anaerobic bacteria, ultimately killing them.  The combined effect provides targeted treatment for both fungal and bacterial components of certain infections.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Do not use this combination if you are allergic to fluconazole, ornidazole, or any of its inactive ingredients.
* **Liver Disease:** This combination should be used with caution in patients with liver disease, as it can potentially affect liver function. Regular liver function tests may be required during treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  Fluconazole and Ornidazole may not be suitable during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Alcohol Consumption:** Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment with ornidazole, as this can lead to severe side effects.
* **Drug Interactions:** This medication can interact with other drugs, including certain blood thinners, anticonvulsants, and other medications metabolized by the liver.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Neurological Conditions:** Patients with epilepsy or other neurological conditions should use this medication with caution, as it may increase the risk of seizures.
