# Fluconazole + Ornidazole

**Generic Name:** Fluconazole + Ornidazole

**Usage:** This combination is used to treat vaginal infections caused by a mix of yeast (Candida) and bacteria (Trichomonas or Gardnerella).  It's specifically indicated for vulvovaginal candidiasis with a bacterial component,  a condition often presenting with symptoms like itching, burning, discharge, and odor.  **Important Note:** This combination is not a first-line treatment for most vaginal infections and should only be used when prescribed by a doctor after confirming the specific infection through testing.  Self-medicating can be harmful.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Some common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* **Headache:**  Mild to moderate headache
* **Skin reactions:** Rash, itching
* **Hepatic:** (Rare but serious) Liver inflammation (hepatitis), changes in liver function tests
* **Hematologic:** (Rare) Changes in blood cell counts
* **Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, changes in taste
* **Allergic reactions:**  In rare cases, severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur.

This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.

**How it Works:**

* **Fluconazole:** This is an antifungal medication that works by interfering with the production of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. This disruption leads to fungal cell death.
* **Ornidazole:** This is an anti-protozoal and antibacterial medication.  It works by damaging the DNA of microorganisms, leading to their death.  It is effective against several bacteria and protozoa, including Trichomonas vaginalis and Gardnerella vaginalis.

The combination of fluconazole and ornidazole provides broad-spectrum coverage against both fungal and bacterial pathogens commonly involved in mixed vaginal infections.
