# Fluphenazine

**Generic Name:** Fluphenazine

**Usage:**

Fluphenazine is an antipsychotic medication used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.  It can help reduce hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. It's also sometimes used to treat severe behavioral problems in individuals with certain conditions.  The specific formulation (e.g., decanoate for injection) will dictate the frequency of administration.  It's important to note that fluphenazine is a potent medication and should only be used under the strict supervision of a psychiatrist or other qualified healthcare professional.


**Side Effects:**

Fluphenazine can cause a wide range of side effects, varying in severity.  Some common side effects include:

* **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):** These are movement disorders that can include akathisia (restlessness), dystonia (muscle spasms), parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, slow movement), and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements, often of the face and mouth – this can be irreversible).
* **Sedation and drowsiness:** This is a common side effect, especially in the initial stages of treatment.
* **Dry mouth:**  A very frequent side effect.
* **Constipation:**  Another common side effect.
* **Blurred vision:** Can occur in some individuals.
* **Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing):** This can cause dizziness and fainting.
* **Weight gain:**  Can be a significant side effect for some.
* **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):** This is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.  Seek immediate medical attention if symptoms occur.
* **Photosensitivity:** Increased sensitivity to sunlight.
* **Sexual dysfunction:**  Can affect libido and sexual performance.
* **Blood disorders:**  Rare but serious.


**How it Works:**

Fluphenazine is a typical antipsychotic that works primarily by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, movement, and thought processes. By blocking dopamine receptors, fluphenazine reduces the symptoms of psychosis. It also affects other neurotransmitters, like serotonin, to a lesser extent, contributing to its overall effects.


**FAQs:**

* **Is fluphenazine addictive?**  Fluphenazine itself isn't considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids, but individuals can develop tolerance, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect.  Stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms, so tapering off under medical supervision is crucial.

* **How long does it take to work?**  The onset of effects varies, but it may take several weeks to see a significant improvement in symptoms.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking fluphenazine?**  Alcohol can worsen the side effects of fluphenazine, particularly sedation and dizziness. It’s best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.

* **Can fluphenazine be taken with other medications?**  Many drug interactions are possible. Always inform your doctor and pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **What are the long-term effects of fluphenazine?**  Long-term use can increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia and other movement disorders. Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential.
