# Fluphenazine
### Generic Name
Fluphenazine

### Usage

Fluphenazine is a first-generation antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat the symptoms of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.  These symptoms can include hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there), delusions (fixed, false beliefs), disorganized thinking, and severely disturbed behavior.  It's particularly helpful in managing acute psychotic episodes and for long-term maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.  While not its primary use, fluphenazine may also be used to treat severe anxiety and agitation in some cases, although other medications are often preferred for these conditions.  It's important to note that fluphenazine is *not* effective for treating behavioral problems in individuals with intellectual disabilities.

### Dosage

Fluphenazine comes in several forms: oral tablets and liquid concentrate, and intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SubQ) injections (decanoate, a long-acting form).  Dosage varies significantly depending on the formulation, the individual's response, and the severity of their condition.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's instructions precisely.  

**Adults:**

* **Oral (hydrochloride):**  Initial doses typically range from 2.5 to 10 mg per day, divided into several doses.  Maintenance doses are usually lower, between 1 and 5 mg per day.  Higher doses may be necessary in some cases but should be carefully managed by a physician due to increased risk of side effects.
* **Intramuscular (hydrochloride):**  Initial doses are generally lower, starting at 1.25 mg as a single dose.  Higher doses may be needed, but exceeding 10 mg per day requires careful monitoring.
* **Intramuscular/Subcutaneous (decanoate, long-acting):** This is given as an injection and has a much longer duration of effect. Initial doses range from 12.5 to 25 mg, with subsequent doses adjusted based on the individual's response.  The effects of a single injection can last for several weeks.

**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of fluphenazine have not been established in children.  The long-acting decanoate form is contraindicated in children under 12.


### Side Effects

Fluphenazine, like other antipsychotics, can cause a range of side effects.  These vary in frequency and severity.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Blurred vision
* Weight gain
* Restlessness or akathisia (inability to sit still)


**Serious, but Less Common Side Effects:**

* **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):** A rare but life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.  Seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms occur.
* **Tardive dyskinesia:**  A potentially irreversible movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, and other body parts.  Risk increases with longer duration of use.
* **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):**  These include Parkinson-like symptoms (tremor, rigidity, slow movement), dystonia (muscle spasms), and akathisia.
* **Agranulocytosis:**  A severe drop in white blood cells, increasing the risk of infection.  Regular blood tests are often recommended.
* **Orthostatic hypotension:**  A sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing, which can cause dizziness and fainting.

This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects are possible.  Consult a healthcare provider if you experience any concerning side effects.

### How it Works

Fluphenazine is a dopamine receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain.  In psychotic disorders, dopamine activity is thought to be abnormally high in certain brain regions. By blocking dopamine receptors, fluphenazine reduces the severity of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions.  It also affects other neurotransmitters, which contributes to its effects on other symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fluphenazine should not be used by individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication or other phenothiazines, severe CNS depression, coma, blood dyscrasias, or severe hepatic disease.  The long-acting decanoate form is contraindicated in children under 12.
* **Drug Interactions:** Fluphenazine can interact with many other medications.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.  Particular caution is advised with medications that prolong the QT interval, antihypertensives, lithium, and CNS depressants.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Fluphenazine is a Category C drug during pregnancy.  Its use should be carefully weighed against the potential risks. It's excreted in breast milk and is generally not recommended during breastfeeding.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Increased mortality risk has been observed in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotics. Fluphenazine is not approved for this use.
* **Other Precautions:**  Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, liver or kidney impairment, a history of seizures, or those at risk for orthostatic hypotension or aspiration pneumonia.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking fluphenazine suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping fluphenazine abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always follow your healthcare provider's instructions for gradually tapering off the medication.

* **Q: How should I store fluphenazine?** A: Store fluphenazine as directed on the label, usually at room temperature away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is it safe to drink alcohol while taking fluphenazine?** A: No. Alcohol can worsen the sedative effects of fluphenazine and increase the risk of side effects.

* **Q: Can I drive while taking fluphenazine?** A:  Drowsiness is a common side effect, so you should avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you.
