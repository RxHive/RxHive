# Fosfestrol

**Generic Name:** Diethylstilbestrol (DES)

**Usage:**  Fosfestrol is not a current, accepted generic name.  The information below refers to Diethylstilbestrol (DES), a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen that was widely used in the past, but is largely obsolete due to significant safety concerns.  Its use was primarily:

* **Treatment of certain hormone-dependent cancers:**  In the past, DES was used to treat some types of breast cancer, prostate cancer, and uterine cancer.  This is rarely done now due to better, safer alternatives.
* **Prevention of miscarriage:**  DES was historically prescribed to prevent miscarriage in high-risk pregnancies.  This practice has been discontinued due to serious adverse effects.
* **Treatment of menopause symptoms:** Again, due to safety concerns, this is no longer a use.
* **Other obsolete uses:** It had various other obsolete uses, such as treatment of endometriosis and certain types of infertility (again, not used now).

**Side Effects:**  DES carries significant risks, many of which only manifest years later. These include:

* **Vaginal and cervical abnormalities in female offspring exposed in utero:**  This includes clear cell adenocarcinoma (a rare but serious cancer), structural abnormalities, and infertility.
* **Reproductive tract abnormalities in male offspring exposed in utero:**  These include abnormalities of the reproductive organs and reduced sperm count.
* **Increased risk of certain cancers:**  Both the person taking DES and their offspring are at increased risk for certain cancers.
* **Thromboembolic events (blood clots):**  Increased risk of blood clots.
* **Gynecomastia (breast development in males):**  In males taking DES.
* **Nausea, vomiting:** Common side effects.
* **Breast tenderness:** Common side effects.
* **Fluid retention:** Common side effects.


**How it Works:** DES mimics the effects of estrogen in the body by binding to estrogen receptors.  This affects various tissues and processes throughout the body,  leading to its past uses in hormone-dependent cancers and conditions.

**FAQs:**

* **Is DES still prescribed?** No, it's largely obsolete due to its significant side effects and the availability of safer alternatives.  It's rarely, if ever, used now.
* **What are the long-term effects of DES exposure?**  Long-term effects can include reproductive tract abnormalities, increased cancer risk, and other health problems in both the person taking the drug and their offspring.
* **Should I be concerned if I was exposed to DES in utero?** If you suspect you were exposed to DES in utero, consult a doctor.  Regular screenings and monitoring are crucial.
* **Are there any safe alternatives to DES?** Yes, many safer and more effective alternatives exist for treating conditions where DES was once used.
