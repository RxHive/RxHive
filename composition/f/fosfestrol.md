# Fosfestrol
### Generic Name
Fosfestrol (Diethylstilbestrol Diphosphate)

### Usage
Fosfestrol is primarily used in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer in men.  It works by reducing testosterone levels, which can help slow the growth of prostate cancer cells.  It's important to note that Fosfestrol is not a first-line treatment for prostate cancer and is typically used when other treatments haven't been effective.

### Dosage
Dosage of Fosfestrol varies significantly depending on the route of administration (intravenous or oral) and the patient's response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow the physician's prescribed dosage regimen precisely.  There is no established pediatric use for Fosfestrol; it is contraindicated in children.

**Adult Dosage (Prostate Cancer):**

* **Intravenous (IV) Infusion:** The initial dose is typically 600-1200 mg per day administered slowly over one hour for 5-10 days.  This is often followed by a maintenance dose of 300 mg/day for 10-20 days, potentially decreasing further to 300-600 mg four times per week or even once weekly over several months, as determined by the physician.

* **Oral:** Initial doses may be 360-480 mg three times daily (TID), later reducing to a maintenance dose of 120-240 mg TID or even 240 mg daily, depending on the individual's response and tolerance.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary based on individual patient response and potential side effects.  Patients with liver impairment require careful monitoring and potentially reduced dosage.  Always consult with a healthcare professional for any dosage changes.

### Side Effects
Fosfestrol, like other hormonal therapies, can cause several side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency.

* **Common:** Edema (swelling), gynecomastia (breast enlargement in men).
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), hyperprolactinemia (high prolactin levels), hypocalcemia (low blood calcium), hypogonadism (low sex hormone production), hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells), pancytopenia (deficiency of all blood cells), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), hepatitis (liver inflammation), dysuria (painful urination), and various types of cancer (breast, cervical, ovarian, testicular).  Note that some listed side effects, such as various cancers, may be related to the underlying disease or long-term effects of hormone therapy, rather than a direct result of Fosfestrol.
* **Other possible side effects:**  Hirsutism (excess hair growth), papillomatosis (wart-like growths), porphyria (disorder affecting heme synthesis), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), and speech disturbances.

**Important:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.


### How it Works
Fosfestrol is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into an active form (diethylstilbestrol) in the body.  It acts as an estrogen agonist, binding to estrogen receptors and exerting its effects primarily by suppressing testosterone production in men. This suppression of testosterone helps slow the growth of prostate cancer cells, which are often dependent on androgens (male sex hormones) for growth. Fosfestrol might also have direct cytotoxic effects (killing cancer cells) on prostate cells.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Fosfestrol is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, men with estrogen-dependent neoplasia (cancers stimulated by estrogen), active thrombophlebitis (blood clots in veins), pregnant or breastfeeding women, and children.

* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with a history of heart disease or liver impairment.  Alcohol consumption should be avoided during treatment.

* **Drug Interactions:** Fosfestrol can interact with several medications, including bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, hepatotoxic medications, protease inhibitors, somatrem/somatropin, and tamoxifen.  Consult a physician about any medications you are currently taking before starting Fosfestrol.
