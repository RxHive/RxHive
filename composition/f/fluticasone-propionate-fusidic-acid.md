# Fluticasone Propionate + Fusidic Acid
### Generic Name
Fluticasone Propionate + Fusidic Acid

### Usage
Fluticasone propionate and fusidic acid combination cream or ointment is primarily used to treat skin infections that involve both inflammation and bacterial infection.  This combination is particularly effective for conditions like eczema (atopic dermatitis) that have become secondarily infected with bacteria.  The fluticasone propionate component is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation, swelling, redness, and itching associated with eczema and other inflammatory skin conditions.  The fusidic acid component is an antibiotic that targets and kills bacteria commonly responsible for secondary skin infections, such as *Staphylococcus aureus*. This dual action makes it a valuable treatment for managing both the inflammatory and infectious aspects of the skin problem simultaneously.  It's important to note that this combination is not suitable for all skin conditions, and a doctor should always diagnose and recommend the appropriate treatment.


### Dosage
Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific product formulation (cream or ointment), the affected area, and the severity of the condition. Always follow the directions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Generally, a thin layer of the cream or ointment is applied to the affected area twice daily. The application should be gentle and spread evenly.  For children, the dosage and application should be determined by a healthcare professional based on age, weight, and the extent of the skin condition.  There's no intravenous (IV) formulation of this combination; it is applied topically only.  Do not use more than prescribed, as this will not increase effectiveness and could lead to increased side effects.  The duration of treatment also varies; usually, improvement is seen within a few days, but a course of treatment as directed by your physician is usually needed for complete resolution.


### Side Effects
* **Common Side Effects:** Skin burning or stinging at the application site, itching, dryness, redness. These are usually mild and temporary.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Thinning of the skin, skin discoloration, acne-like eruptions, increased hair growth (hypertrichosis), stretch marks (striae). Allergic reactions such as rash or swelling are also possible though rare.  Prolonged or excessive use can also lead to the suppression of the adrenal glands (although this is unlikely with topical application of a short course).
* **If you experience any of these side effects, particularly those that are persistent or severe, stop using the medication and seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works
Fluticasone propionate, a corticosteroid, works by reducing inflammation.  It achieves this by suppressing the activity of inflammatory cells within the skin, decreasing the production of inflammatory chemicals, and constricting blood vessels, thereby reducing swelling and redness. Fusidic acid, an antibiotic, works by interfering with the protein synthesis of bacteria, ultimately preventing their growth and reproduction. By combining these two active ingredients, this medication provides a two-pronged approach to managing skin conditions involving both inflammation and bacterial infection.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used if you are allergic to fluticasone propionate, fusidic acid, or any of its ingredients.
* **Drug Interactions:** While not many direct drug interactions are known, inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements, as potential interactions cannot be completely ruled out.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be discussed with a healthcare professional. While the amount absorbed systemically is minimal,  it's crucial to weigh the benefits against potential risks.
* **Children:**  Use in children should be under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.  Avoid applying to large areas of the body or for extended durations in young children.
* **Vulnerable populations:**  Patients with impaired immune systems or those with thin or fragile skin should use this medication with caution and under close medical supervision. Avoid applying to the face, groin, or armpits unless directed by a physician.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use it on my face?**  A: Unless specifically directed by your doctor, avoid applying it to the face, groin or armpits as these areas have thinner skin and are more prone to side effects.
