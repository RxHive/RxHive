# Fotemustine
### Generic Name
Fotemustine

### Usage
Fotemustine is a chemotherapy medication primarily used to treat disseminated malignant melanoma, including cases with metastasis to the brain.  It can be used as a single agent or in combination with other anticancer drugs.  Additionally, it's indicated for the treatment of early-stage malignant brain tumors.  The specific use and combination therapy will be determined by a physician based on the individual patient's condition and response to treatment.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The dosage of Fotemustine varies depending on whether it's used for induction or maintenance therapy and whether it's administered intravenously (IV) or intra-arterially.  

* **Malignant Melanoma & Brain Tumors (Induction):**  The typical dose is 100 mg/m² administered once weekly for three weeks as a single agent, or for two weeks as part of a combination chemotherapy regimen.
* **Malignant Melanoma & Brain Tumors (Maintenance):**  After a 4-5 week break following induction, the maintenance dose is 100 mg/m² once every three weeks.  Maintenance treatment is only considered when the platelet count is >100,000/mm³ and the granulocyte count is >2000/mm³.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Fotemustine is contraindicated in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are typically made based on blood counts (specifically granulocyte and platelet levels) to manage hematologic toxicity.  If counts fall below certain thresholds, the dose may be reduced or treatment delayed.  The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  A healthcare professional will monitor blood counts closely and adjust the dose accordingly.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Nausea and vomiting
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Pancytopenia (severe deficiency of all blood cells)

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Fotemustine is a type of chemotherapy drug called an alkylating agent.  It works by interfering with the DNA of cancer cells, preventing them from dividing and growing. Specifically, it has both alkylating and carbamoylating effects. Fotemustine also causes cancer cells to accumulate in the G2M phase of the cell cycle, further inhibiting their growth and replication.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Fotemustine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, pregnant or breastfeeding women, women of childbearing age not using effective contraception, children under 18 years of age, and those receiving the yellow fever vaccine concurrently.

**Warnings:**  Fotemustine can cause bone marrow suppression, central nervous system effects, extravasation (leakage from the vein during IV administration), gastrointestinal toxicity, hepatic impairment, and ophthalmic effects.  It should be used with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and in elderly patients.

**Drug Interactions:** Fotemustine may interact with numerous other medications. It's vital to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Interactions can affect the effectiveness of Fotemustine or increase the risk of side effects.

### FAQs

**Q: How is Fotemustine stored?** A:  Storage instructions will be provided by your pharmacist and should be followed carefully.

**Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Fotemustine?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while undergoing chemotherapy. Alcohol can exacerbate side effects like nausea and vomiting.  Discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for guidance; do not attempt to double up on a missed dose.

**Q: How long will I be on Fotemustine?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your individual condition and response to therapy. This will be determined by your oncologist.
