# Formoterol + Tiotropium

**Generic Name:** Formoterol fumarate and tiotropium bromide

**Usage:**

Formoterol fumarate and tiotropium bromide is a combination inhaler used to prevent and treat symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It's prescribed to help improve breathing and reduce shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing.  This combination is *not* typically used for asthma.  It is used for patients with COPD who require both a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA).


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Dry mouth
* Headache
* Constipation
* Sore throat
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Urinary tract infections
* Dizziness
* Increased heart rate (tachycardia)

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Glaucoma
* Increased risk of pneumonia (particularly in patients with a history of pneumonia)
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing)
* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias)
* Increased risk of cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack, stroke) in some patients

**How it Works:**

This combination inhaler contains two different medications that work in different ways to improve lung function:

* **Formoterol fumarate (LABA):**  Relaxes the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.  It works by stimulating beta2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs.  The effect is long-lasting.

* **Tiotropium bromide (LAMA):** Blocks the action of acetylcholine, a chemical that causes the airways to tighten. This also helps to relax and open the airways, improving breathing. The effect is long-lasting.

By combining these two medications, the inhaler provides a broader and more effective approach to managing COPD symptoms than either medication alone.

**FAQs:**

* **How often should I use it?**  Usually, one inhalation once daily at the same time each day.  **Never exceed the prescribed dose.**
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once to make up for a missed dose.
* **Can I use this inhaler for asthma?** No, this combination is generally not recommended for asthma.  Different medications are typically used for asthma management.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, increased heart rate, or worsening breathing.
* **How should I store it?** Store the inhaler at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Can I use other medications with this inhaler?**  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins, to avoid potential interactions.
