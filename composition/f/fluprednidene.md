# Fluprednidene
### Generic Name
Fluprednidene

### Usage
Fluprednidene is a topical corticosteroid primarily used to treat corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.  These are skin conditions that improve with corticosteroid treatment.  While it's not a cure-all for every skin problem, it effectively manages inflammation and itching associated with various conditions.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, the typical application involves a thin layer of Fluprednidene cream (0.1%) or ointment (0.05% or 0.1%) applied to the affected skin area and gently rubbed in.  The frequency of application isn't standardized and depends on the severity of the condition and the physician's instructions.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Fluprednidene in children haven't been established. Therefore, its use in children is generally not recommended.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before using this medication if you have any liver or kidney problems.


### Side Effects
Common side effects, though their frequency isn't precisely defined, can include:

* Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)
* Skin thinning and atrophy (thinning or wasting away of the skin)
* Skin dryness and irritation
* Epistaxis (nosebleeds) â€“ although this is less common with topical application
* Loss of skin collagen
* Local hypopigmentation (loss of skin color)
* Burning sensation
* Erythema (redness)
* Dermatitis (inflammation of the skin)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Secondary infection (infection occurring as a result of the primary condition or treatment)
* Skin atrophy


Less common but serious side effects may occur with prolonged use or extensive application and include systemic effects such as manifestations of Cushing's syndrome (a hormonal disorder), hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), or glycosuria (glucose in the urine).  If any of these occur, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Fluprednidene belongs to a class of drugs called corticosteroids. It works by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune system in the affected skin area. This action is achieved through the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins (lipocortins).  These proteins interfere with the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes, substances that contribute to swelling, pain, and redness.  Essentially, it dampens the inflammatory response in the skin, alleviating symptoms.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  Fluprednidene is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to it or who have untreated bacterial, fungal, viral, or tubercular skin lesions; rosacea, perioral dermatitis, and ulcerative skin conditions.  Also, avoid using it with occlusive dressings (bandages that prevent air from reaching the skin). Avoid indiscriminate use for simple pruritus (itching).


**Interactions:**  Fluprednidene's effects may be reduced when used concurrently with certain drugs like barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, and rifampicin. It can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding when combined with NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and decrease the effectiveness of antimuscarinics (used in conditions like myasthenia gravis).  Concomitant use with these medications should be avoided or carefully monitored by a physician. It can also increase the requirement for antidiabetics and antihypertensives.


**Warnings:**  Long-term or extensive use of Fluprednidene may increase the risk of systemic side effects, secondary infections, or reactivation of latent tuberculosis.  Use with caution in pregnant or breastfeeding women, the elderly, and children (long-term use in children is discouraged).
