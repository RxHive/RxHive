# Fluspirilene
### Generic Name
Fluspirilene

### Usage
Fluspirilene is a long-acting antipsychotic medication primarily used to manage psychoses, particularly schizophrenia.  Its mechanism involves blocking dopamine receptors in the brain, which helps alleviate the positive symptoms of schizophrenia like hallucinations and delusions.  It's also used to manage anxiety, although this is a secondary, less common application.

### Dosage
Fluspirilene is administered intramuscularly (IM). Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the individual patient's response.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's precise instructions.

**Psychoses (including Schizophrenia):**

* **Initial Dose:**  Typically starts at 2 mg per week.
* **Maintenance Dose:**  Ranges from 1 to 10 mg per week, adjusted based on individual needs.  Higher doses might be necessary for some patients, while others may find 1 mg sufficient.
* **Elderly Patients:** Often require a reduced dose (25-50% of the standard adult initial dose) due to increased sensitivity.

**Anxiety:**

* **Typical Dose:** 1.5 mg weekly;  1 mg weekly might suffice in cases with mild anxiety.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised when using fluspirilene in patients with these conditions.  A doctor should carefully monitor the patient's response and adjust the dosage as needed.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Parkinsonian symptoms (tremors, rigidity)
* Dystonia (muscle spasms)
* Akathisia (restlessness)
* Tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements)
* Problems with temperature regulation
* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a rare but serious condition)
* Central nervous system effects (e.g., drowsiness, dizziness)
* Gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, constipation)
* Nasal congestion
* Antimuscarinic effects (e.g., dry mouth, blurred vision)
* Cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., changes in heart rate or blood pressure)
* ECG changes
* Endocrine effects (e.g., changes in hormone levels)
* Blood disorders
* Photosensitivity
* Skin reactions (rashes, contact dermatitis)
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
* Corneal and lens opacities
* Pigmentation of the skin, cornea, conjunctiva, and retina (purplish discoloration)


Serious but less common side effects necessitate immediate medical attention.  Consult a healthcare provider if any adverse effects occur.


### How it Works
Fluspirilene is a diphenylbutylpiperidine antipsychotic, similar in some ways to chlorpromazine (a phenothiazine).  It works primarily by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, movement, and thought processes.  By reducing dopamine activity, fluspirilene helps to alleviate the positive symptoms associated with psychotic disorders like schizophrenia.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Fluspirilene is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to fluspirilene or other diphenylbutylpiperidines, comatose states, CNS depression, and pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the adrenal gland).

**Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of coma due to hepatotoxicity (liver damage) and photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight) at higher doses.

**Cautions:** Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, depression, myasthenia gravis, prostatic hypertrophy, severe respiratory disease, blood disorders, a history of jaundice, and in elderly patients.

**Drug Interactions:**  Fluspirilene can interact significantly with a wide range of medications, including ACE inhibitors, alpha-blockers, amantadine, general anesthetics, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, antiarrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants, anxiolytics and hypnotics, apomorphine, and many others.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

**Important Note:** Fluspirilene should only be administered intramuscularly.  It should never be given subcutaneously or intraarticularly, nor injected into areas with poor blood flow. Injection sites should be rotated to avoid pain and induration.  Discontinuation should be gradual, with a slow tapering of the dose.  Driving or operating machinery may be impaired.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for fluspirilene to work?** A: The onset of action varies, but therapeutic effects usually aren't fully realized for several weeks.

* **Q: Can I stop taking fluspirilene suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping fluspirilene abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering the dose.

* **Q: How should I store fluspirilene?** A: Store it as directed by your doctor or pharmacist, typically in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for guidance.  Do not try to adjust the dosage yourself.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking fluspirilene?** A:  There aren't any specific dietary restrictions, but maintaining a healthy diet is generally beneficial.
