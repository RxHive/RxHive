# Fexofenadine
### Generic Name
Fexofenadine

### Usage

Fexofenadine is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives).  Seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion.  Chronic idiopathic urticaria is characterized by recurrent hives (urticaria) lasting for six weeks or longer, with or without angioedema (swelling). Fexofenadine works by blocking histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  By blocking histamine, it reduces the inflammatory response and alleviates allergic symptoms.  While not its primary indication, fexofenadine may be used off-label in other allergic conditions at the discretion of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **For upper respiratory allergies:**  The usual adult dose is 60 mg twice daily (every 12 hours), not exceeding 120 mg per day.  Some once-daily formulations are available at a dose of 180 mg.  Always follow the dosage instructions provided with your specific medication.
* **For chronic idiopathic urticaria:** The typical dose is 180 mg once daily, but dosages ranging from 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily have been used. This is an off-label use and should be discussed with your doctor.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Dosage for children depends significantly on age and weight, and the available formulation.  Always consult a pediatrician or follow the prescription instructions carefully.  Generally:

* Infants and toddlers (6 months to 2 years): Dosages typically start at 15 mg twice daily, increasing to 30mg twice daily as needed.
* Children (2-11 years):  30mg twice daily is often prescribed.
* Children 12 years and older:  The adult dosage can usually be given.

The medication comes in various forms, including tablets, orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs), and liquid suspension.  Always follow the instructions provided with your specific medication for administration.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in more than 1% of patients):**

* Headache
* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  While rare, serious side effects like hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and difficulty breathing),  can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any such reaction.  Other less common side effects include:

* Vomiting (especially in young children)
* Insomnia
* Nervousness


**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Fexofenadine is a selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonist. This means it blocks the action of histamine at its receptor sites on cells involved in allergic reactions (mainly in the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels, and respiratory tract). Histamine causes the symptoms of allergic reactions like itching, swelling, and inflammation.  By blocking histamine's action, fexofenadine reduces these symptoms without significantly crossing the blood-brain barrier, which accounts for its generally low sedative effects compared to other antihistamines.


### Precautions

* **Renal impairment:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with kidney problems. Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on your kidney function.
* **Hepatic impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is usually needed, but itâ€™s best to discuss this with your doctor.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Fexofenadine is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are not fully understood. Consult your doctor before taking fexofenadine if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.
* **Interactions with other medications:** Fexofenadine can interact with other drugs, including some antacids. Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **High-fat meals and fruit juices:** Consuming high-fat meals and certain fruit juices (grapefruit, apple, orange) can reduce the absorption of fexofenadine.  It's best to avoid consuming these with the medication.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take fexofenadine with antacids?** A: It is generally recommended to avoid taking fexofenadine concurrently with aluminum and magnesium-containing antacids as it may reduce its effectiveness.  Maintain a sufficient time gap between taking both medications.
* **Q: How should I store fexofenadine?** A: Store fexofenadine as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q:  Can I drive after taking fexofenadine?** A: While less sedating than some antihistamines, fexofenadine may cause drowsiness in some individuals.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if you feel drowsy.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Is fexofenadine habit-forming?** A: No, fexofenadine is not a controlled substance and does not have a potential for abuse or dependence.
