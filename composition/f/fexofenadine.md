# Fexofenadine

**Generic Name:** Fexofenadine

**Usage:**

Fexofenadine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies such as:

* Sneezing
* Runny nose
* Itchy, watery eyes
* Itchy nose and throat
* Hives (urticaria)

It's effective in treating both seasonal allergies (hay fever) and year-round allergies.  It's also sometimes used to treat itching caused by chronic idiopathic urticaria (a type of chronic hives).  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions for dosage and usage.  Different formulations (tablets, capsules, etc.) may have slightly different administration guidelines.


**Side Effects:**

Fexofenadine is generally well-tolerated, but some people may experience side effects, which are usually mild.  These can include:

* Headache
* Drowsiness (although less common than with some other antihistamines)
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Dry mouth
* Fatigue


Serious side effects are rare, but you should contact your doctor immediately if you experience:

* Severe allergic reactions (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Fast or irregular heartbeat
* Seizures


**How it Works:**

Fexofenadine is a selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonist.  In simpler terms, it works by blocking the effects of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine is responsible for many allergy symptoms. By blocking histamine's action, fexofenadine reduces or prevents these symptoms.  Importantly, it does not cross the blood-brain barrier as readily as some older antihistamines, leading to a lower incidence of drowsiness.
