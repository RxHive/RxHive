# Flubendazole
### Generic Name
Flubendazole

### Usage
Flubendazole is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic medication, meaning it's effective against various parasitic worms. Its primary use is in treating intestinal infections caused by several types of worms:

*   **Enterobiasis (pinworm infection):** This is a common parasitic infection, especially in children, caused by the *Enterobius vermicularis* worm.
*   **Ascariasis (roundworm infection):** This infection is caused by the *Ascaris lumbricoides* worm.
*   **Trichuriasis (whipworm infection):** Caused by the *Trichuris trichiura* worm.
*   **Hookworm infections:** Primarily caused by *Ancylostoma duodenale* and *Necator americanus* worms.

Flubendazole works by disrupting the worms' metabolism, ultimately leading to their death and elimination from the body.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** The information below is for general knowledge and should not replace consultation with a healthcare professional.  Dosage should always be determined by a doctor based on individual needs.

**Adults:**

*   **Enterobiasis:**  A single 100mg oral dose. A repeat dose may be necessary after 2-3 weeks, as determined by a physician.
*   **Trichuriasis, Ascariasis, Hookworm infections:** 100mg twice daily (BID) for three days.


**Children:**

*Safety and efficacy have not been established in children under 1 year old.*

*   **Enterobiasis:** A single 100mg oral dose.  A repeat dose may be necessary after 2-3 weeks, as determined by a physician.
*   **Trichuriasis, Ascariasis, Hookworm infections:** 100mg twice daily (BID) for three days.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dose adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before administering flubendazole to patients with impaired liver or kidney function.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include gastrointestinal disturbances (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal cramps).  Less common, but potentially serious side effects include headache, dizziness, allergic reactions (like skin rashes or itching), elevated liver enzyme levels, hair loss (alopecia), and bone marrow suppression.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, immediately consult a healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Flubendazole disrupts the worms' ability to function by interfering with their microtubules. Microtubules are essential structures within the worm's cells involved in nutrient uptake and energy production. By disrupting these microtubules, flubendazole prevents the worms from absorbing glucose and storing glycogen, leading to their death and eventual expulsion from the body.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Flubendazole is contraindicated (should not be used) in pregnant women and individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to flubendazole or any of its components.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Flubendazole is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, use caution if breastfeeding. Consult a physician before using flubendazole while breastfeeding.
*   **Children:** Use with caution in children under 1 year of age, as safety and efficacy have not been established in this age group.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Flubendazole may interact with methotrexate, potentially delaying the excretion of methotrexate.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
*   **Increased Risk:** Patients may experience an increased risk of gastrointestinal disturbances.


### FAQs
