# Fosnetupitant + Palonosetron
### Generic Name
Fosnetupitant + Palonosetron

### Usage
Fosnetupitant and Palonosetron is a combination medication used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, specifically highly emetogenic chemotherapy (including cisplatin-based regimens).  It's administered before the chemotherapy begins to help minimize both the acute (short-term) and delayed (longer-term) side effects of nausea and vomiting.  This combination therapy is typically used as part of a broader antiemetic regimen, often including other drugs like dexamethasone and sometimes olanzapine.  It is not used to treat nausea and vomiting from other causes.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy):**

*   **Intravenous (IV):**  A single dose of Fosnetupitant 235 mg and Palonosetron 0.25 mg is given 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy on day 1.  This is typically part of a multi-drug regimen that also includes dexamethasone (12mg 30 minutes before chemotherapy on day 1 and 8mg daily on days 2-4) and often olanzapine (days 1-4).  Always follow the specific instructions provided by your oncologist or healthcare provider.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and efficacy of Fosnetupitant and Palonosetron have not been established in children under 18 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

*   **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for mild or moderate impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B).  Avoid use in cases of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
*   **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for creatinine clearance (CrCl) of â‰¥30 mL/min. Avoid use if CrCl is <30 mL/min or in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include: nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, fatigue, and slowed heart rate. Less common but serious side effects include:  blurred vision, chest pain or discomfort, confusion, difficulty breathing, fainting, fever, irregular heartbeats, sweating, and unusual weakness.  

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Fosnetupitant is a neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonist.  It blocks the action of substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in triggering nausea and vomiting. Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that also blocks neurotransmitters that contribute to nausea and vomiting. By acting through different mechanisms, the combination provides broader antiemetic coverage.

### Precautions

*   **Interactions:**  Fosnetupitant is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4.  Therefore, concomitant use with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 or that affect CYP3A4 activity may alter the levels of Fosnetupitant, Palonosetron or other medications, potentially increasing the risk of side effects or reducing the effectiveness of the treatment.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.  Strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the effectiveness of this medication.
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Fosnetupitant and Palonosetron during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
*   **Cardiac Considerations:** Use caution in elderly patients and in those with existing or potential cardiac conduction abnormalities (e.g., QT prolongation).
*   **Hypersensitivity:** Be aware of the potential for hypersensitivity reactions and serotonin syndrome (a serious but rare condition).  Seek immediate medical attention if symptoms such as mental status changes, autonomic instability, neuromuscular symptoms, seizures, or gastrointestinal symptoms occur.
* **Other Warnings**: There are no other contraindications listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
