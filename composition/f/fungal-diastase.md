# Fungal Diastase
### Generic Name
Fungal Diastase with Pepsin

### Usage
Fungal diastase, combined with pepsin, is primarily used as a digestive aid.  It's indicated for the symptomatic relief of various gastrointestinal issues, including acid indigestion, sour stomach, flatulence (gas), epigastric distress (discomfort in the upper abdomen), dyspepsia (indigestion), eructation (belching), and reduced appetite.  While it's often used to address these symptoms, it's crucial to remember that it doesn't treat the underlying cause of these problems.  If symptoms persist or worsen, consulting a doctor is essential to determine the root cause and appropriate treatment.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the formulation (capsule, drops, syrup) and the specific indication.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  

**Adults:**  The typical adult dose for dyspepsia, sour stomach, heartburn, acid indigestion, belching, epigastric distress, bloating after meals, flatulence, and as a digestive supplement during pregnancy is:

* **Capsules:** One capsule containing 50mg of fungal diastase and 10mg of pepsin, taken after meals, twice or thrice daily (BID or TID).
* **Drops:** The dose will vary depending on the concentration; refer to product labeling for exact instructions. A common concentration is 33.33 mg of fungal diastase and 5 mg of pepsin per 5 mL of solution.
* **Syrup:** Similar to drops, the dose is specific to the product. A common formulation contains 50mg of fungal diastase and 10mg of pepsin per 5mL of syrup.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of fungal diastase with pepsin in children have not been established. It should not be given to children without specific guidance from a pediatrician.

### Side Effects
Common side effects, although not definitively quantified in terms of frequency, may include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal cramping

While rare, serious adverse reactions are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms after taking this medication, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Fungal diastase is a starch-degrading enzyme. It works by catalyzing the breakdown of alpha 1-4 glycosidic linkages in polysaccharides (complex carbohydrates). This process yields simpler sugars like dextrins, oligosaccharides, maltose, and glucose.  This enzymatic action aids in digestion, particularly of starchy foods.  Pepsin, the other component, aids in protein digestion.  Together, they can alleviate some digestive discomfort associated with incomplete digestion.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Fungal diastase with pepsin is contraindicated in individuals with:

* Known hypersensitivity (allergy) to any of the ingredients.
* Acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
* Acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis.

**Warnings:**

* Pregnancy and Lactation: The safety of fungal diastase with pepsin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your doctor before use.
* Interactions:  While not extensively documented, potential interactions with other medications are possible. Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are currently taking.
* Other considerations:  Always follow dosage instructions precisely.  Overuse may lead to undesirable effects.  If symptoms persist or worsen, consult a healthcare professional.
