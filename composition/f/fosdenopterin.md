# Fosdenopterin
### Generic Name
Fosdenopterin

### Usage

Fosdenopterin is a medication used to treat molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) Type A.  MoCD Type A is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder affecting the body's ability to process sulfur-containing compounds.  This deficiency leads to a buildup of toxic substances, causing severe neurological problems.  Fosdenopterin's primary use is to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with this condition.  It does not cure MoCD Type A, but it helps manage the disease's progression and potentially improves outcomes.


### Dosage

Fosdenopterin is administered intravenously (IV). Dosage varies depending on the patient's age and weight.

**Adults:** The recommended dose is 0.9 mg/kg once daily, using the patient's actual body weight.

**Children:** Dosage is more complex and depends on the child's age and gestational age if born prematurely.

* **Children under 1 year old (preterm, gestational age <37 weeks):**  The initial dose is 0.4 mg/kg daily. This increases to 0.7 mg/kg daily at one month of age and 0.9 mg/kg daily at three months of age.
* **Children under 1 year old (term, gestational age ≥37 weeks):** The initial dose is 0.55 mg/kg daily, increasing to 0.75 mg/kg daily at one month and 0.9 mg/kg daily at three months.
* **Children 1 year and older:** The dose is the same as for adults (0.9 mg/kg daily).

**Important Note:** Fosdenopterin should only be started if a patient has a confirmed or presumptive diagnosis of MoCD Type A.  If a presumptive diagnosis is made, confirmation via genetic testing is crucial after starting treatment. If the diagnosis is not confirmed, the medication should be stopped.  The medication should be administered via IV infusion at a rate of 1.5 mL/minute through a 0.2-micron filter with non-DEHP tubing.  The entire infusion should be completed within 4 hours of reconstitution.  Do not mix or administer with other medications.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of Fosdenopterin may include:

* Nervous system: Agitation, seizures
* Respiratory: Cough, lower respiratory tract infection, oropharyngeal pain, pneumonia, sneezing, tonsillitis, upper respiratory tract infection
* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, vomiting
* Dermatologic: Maculopapular rash
* Hematologic/Oncologic: Anemia
* Infection: Bacteremia, influenza, viral infection
* Local (at IV site): Catheter complications
* Ophthalmic: Eye swelling
* Otic: Otitis media
* Other: Fever


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, are possible.  If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Fosdenopterin is a cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) analogue.  In patients with MoCD Type A, mutations in the MOCS1 gene impair the synthesis of cPMP, a crucial intermediate in the production of the molybdenum cofactor. This cofactor is essential for the activity of several vital enzymes, including sulfite oxidase.  Sulfite oxidase helps break down sulfite, a toxic compound.  By providing an exogenous source of cPMP, Fosdenopterin helps restore the production of the molybdenum cofactor, reducing the levels of harmful sulfites.


### Precautions

* **No known contraindications are reported in the manufacturer's labeling.** However, there is an increased risk of photosensitivity. Patients should avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight and UV light.  Protective measures like wearing protective clothing, hats, and broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF ≥30) are advised.
* There is limited data on Fosdenopterin use in pregnant or breastfeeding women. The benefits and risks should be carefully evaluated before use in these populations.
* No dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic or renal impairment.
* Monitor patients for anemia, elevated white blood cell counts, and signs of infection. Eye exams before starting therapy are recommended.
