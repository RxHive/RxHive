# Fusidic Acid (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Fusidic Acid (Systemic)

### Usage
Fusidic acid is a systemic antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Staphylococcus bacteria.  These infections can range from skin infections (cutaneous infections) to more serious conditions like bone infections (osteomyelitis), pneumonia, bloodstream infections (septicemia), wound infections, endocarditis (infection of the heart valves), and infections complicating cystic fibrosis.  It's crucial to understand that fusidic acid is primarily effective against Staphylococcus bacteria and may not be suitable for other types of bacterial infections.


### Dosage

**Important Note:** The dosage forms of fusidic acid (tablets as sodium fusidate and oral suspension as fusidic acid hemihydrate) are not bioequivalent, meaning they don't have the same bioavailability.  This is important to consider when switching between these forms.

**Adults:**

* **Mild to Moderate Staphylococcal Infections:** Oral tablets (250 mg twice daily) for 5-10 days.
* **Severe Staphylococcal Infections:**
    * Oral suspension: 750 mg to 1.5 g three times daily.
    * Oral tablets: 500-1000 mg three times daily.
    * Intravenous (IV):  Patients <50 kg: 6-7 mg/kg three times daily; Patients â‰¥50 kg: 500 mg three times daily. Treatment duration typically ranges from 5-10 days, but severe infections may require longer treatment.

**Children:**

Dosages for children vary significantly based on age and weight.  Always follow a doctor's prescription and instructions carefully.  Generally,  dosing is calculated based on weight (mg/kg/day) divided into three doses, with adjustments for age and severity.  The use of oral suspension is generally preferred for children under 12 years old.  Consult your pediatrician or healthcare professional for precise guidance on pediatric dosing.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are needed for renal impairment. For patients with hepatic impairment, caution is advised and close monitoring is necessary; consult with a healthcare provider.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (frequency >10%):**

* Nausea

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, lethargy
* Diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, flatulence
* Increased liver enzyme levels, hyperbilirubinemia (increased bilirubin in the blood), jaundice
* Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein), venous irritation (at the IV site)
* Asthenia (weakness)

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), agranulocytosis, anaphylactic shock, anaphylaxis, various blood disorders (anemia, thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, pancytopenia),  liver problems (hepatitis, hepatic failure, cholestasis, hepatic insufficiency), DRESS syndrome (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms), skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, various rashes), kidney problems (renal failure), rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown).

If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as rare but serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Fusidic acid is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, meaning it stops the growth of bacteria rather than directly killing them.  It achieves this by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis.  Specifically, it binds to the bacterial ribosome (the cellular machinery that makes proteins), blocking the transfer of aminoacyl-tRNA, a crucial step in the protein building process.  By inhibiting protein synthesis, fusidic acid prevents the bacteria from multiplying and allows the body's immune system to clear the infection.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to fusidic acid or any formulation components.
* Concurrent use with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), as this combination increases the risk of adverse events.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of skin reactions, including rare but severe ones like DRESS syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
* Increased risk of fungal or bacterial superinfections, including *Clostridioides difficile* infection.
* Caution is advised in patients with liver impairment and those with impaired bilirubin transport/metabolism.
* Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Avoid use during pregnancy due to the potential for neonatal kernicterus (brain damage). Fusidic acid is excreted in breast milk.
*  The drug can interact with several other medications such as penicillins, protease inhibitors, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors; consult a physician.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take fusidic acid with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as fusidic acid can interact with some drugs, potentially affecting their effectiveness or causing adverse effects.
* **Q: How should I store fusidic acid?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q:  Is fusidic acid safe for everyone?** A:  No, fusidic acid has contraindications and precautions, especially for individuals with certain pre-existing conditions or allergies. Always consult a healthcare provider to determine suitability.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The time it takes to see improvement depends on the type and severity of the infection. Symptoms usually improve gradually within a few days. However, always complete the full course of treatment, as directed by your doctor.
