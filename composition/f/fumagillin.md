# Fumagillin
### Generic Name
Fumagillin

### Usage
Fumagillin is primarily used as an amebicide, meaning it's effective against amoebas, specifically *Entamoeba histolytica*, which can cause amoebiasis, a potentially severe intestinal infection.  Historically, it has also seen limited topical use in treating microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis, an infection of the eye's conjunctiva and cornea.  However, its use in these areas is now largely restricted due to its toxicity.  Research continues to explore Fumagillin's potential in cancer treatment due to its ability to inhibit angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels), a process crucial for tumor growth.


### Dosage
Dosage information for Fumagillin is complex and depends heavily on the specific application (which is limited due to toxicity concerns). There is no standardized, widely accepted dosage regimen for general use.  Historically, in treating amoebiasis, dosages varied significantly and were determined on a case-by-case basis by a physician, considering the patient's condition and response to treatment.   Topical use for microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis also involved individualized dosing determined by an ophthalmologist.  **It is crucial to emphasize that Fumagillin should only be administered under strict medical supervision.**  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.


### Side Effects
Fumagillin's toxicity significantly limits its use. Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Fever
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Anemia

More serious, but less frequent, side effects may include:
* Renal (kidney) toxicity
* Hepatic (liver) toxicity
* Bone marrow suppression

**If any adverse effects occur, it's imperative to seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works
Fumagillin's primary mechanism of action is its ability to inhibit methionine aminopeptidase type 2 (MetAP-2), an enzyme crucial for the growth and survival of certain parasites and potentially cancer cells. By inhibiting MetAP-2, Fumagillin disrupts protein synthesis, ultimately leading to the death of the target organism or cell.  Additionally, research suggests that its anti-angiogenic properties contribute to its anti-cancer potential by hindering the formation of new blood vessels that supply tumors.


### Precautions
Fumagillin has a narrow therapeutic index (the difference between the effective dose and the toxic dose), meaning there's a significant risk of toxicity at doses slightly higher than those needed for therapeutic effect.  Therefore, extreme caution is warranted.

* **Contraindications:**  Fumagillin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug.  
* **Drug Interactions:** Interactions with other medications are possible, so informing your physician of all medications being taken is crucial.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally avoided due to potential risks to the fetus or infant.
* **Hepatic or Renal Impairment:** Patients with impaired liver or kidney function require close monitoring if Fumagillin is considered.
* **Elderly and Children:**  Use in the elderly and children requires particular caution due to increased susceptibility to toxicity.

**Fumagillin should only be used under the strict supervision of a qualified physician familiar with its risks and benefits.**


### FAQs

* **Q: Is Fumagillin available over-the-counter?**  A: No, Fumagillin is not available over-the-counter and requires a prescription from a physician.

* **Q: How is Fumagillin stored?** A: Storage instructions should be obtained from the prescribing physician or pharmacist, as it varies depending on the specific formulation.

* **Q:  Are there alternatives to Fumagillin?** A: Yes, there are several other effective anti-amoebic medications and treatments for microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis, which are generally preferred due to Fumagillin's toxicity.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not attempt to adjust the dosage regimen on your own.  Consult your physician for guidance.

* **Q:  Is Fumagillin used for cancer treatment?** A:  While research suggests potential anti-cancer effects, Fumagillin is not currently a standard cancer treatment.  Clinical trials may be exploring this further.
