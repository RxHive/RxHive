# Fish oil triglycerides
### Generic Name
Fish Oil Triglycerides

### Usage

Fish oil triglycerides are primarily used in pediatric patients to treat parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC).  PNAC is a liver condition that develops in infants and children receiving long-term intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition).  This medication provides essential fatty acids and calories, helping to improve liver function and reduce the symptoms of PNAC.  It is crucial to understand that fish oil triglycerides are *not* indicated for the prevention of PNAC.


### Dosage

**Pediatric Dosage (Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Cholestasis):**

* **Intravenous (IV):** The recommended dose is 1 g/kg/day, infused over 8 to 24 hours.  The maximum daily dose is 1 g/kg/day.  The initial infusion rate should be no more than 0.05 mL/min for the first 15-30 minutes, gradually increasing to the required rate. The maximum infusion rate should not exceed 1.5 mL/kg/hour (0.15 g/kg/hour). If hypertriglyceridemia develops (serum triglycerides >250 mg/dL in neonates and infants, or >400 mg/dL in older children), the infusion should be discontinued for 4 hours, and then resumed at a potentially reduced dose (0.5-0.75 g/kg/day) with incremental increases to 1 g/kg/day as tolerated, based on repeat triglyceride levels.

**Adult Dosage:**  Fish oil triglycerides are not indicated for adult use.

### Side Effects

The following side effects have been reported:

**Common (>10%):** Vomiting, agitation, bradycardia (slow heart rate), apnea (temporary cessation of breathing), viral infection, erythema (redness of the skin).

**Less Common (1-10%):** Rash, abscess, neutropenia (low white blood cell count), hypertonia (increased muscle tone), incision site erythema.


**Serious but Less Common:**  Fat overload syndrome, refeeding syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia (high levels of triglycerides in the blood), aluminum toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions (including potentially fatal reactions), infections, and death (in preterm infants due to pulmonary lipid accumulation).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious adverse effects.


### How it Works

Fish oil triglycerides are composed of fatty acids that serve as important substrates for energy production in the body.  The primary mechanism of action involves beta-oxidation, a metabolic process where fatty acids are broken down to generate energy.  Additionally, these fatty acids are crucial for cell membrane structure and function, act as precursors for bioactive molecules, and influence gene expression.  In the context of PNAC, providing these essential fatty acids helps to support liver function and overall health in children receiving parenteral nutrition.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Fish oil triglycerides are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to fish or egg protein, or any other component of the product.

**Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of death in preterm infants due to pulmonary lipid accumulation, hypersensitivity reactions, infections, fat overload syndrome, refeeding syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, and aluminum toxicity.

**Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use with antiplatelet agents (blood thinners) and anticoagulants may increase their effects.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of fish oil triglycerides during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.

**Other Precautions:** Before starting fish oil triglycerides, correct severe fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and measure baseline serum triglyceride levels.  Closely monitor for signs and symptoms of infections, essential fatty acid deficiency, fat overload, refeeding syndrome, pleural or pericardial effusion, and hypersensitivity reactions.  Regular blood glucose, complete blood count (CBC), hepatic and renal function tests, fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, and serum triglycerides should be monitored.

### FAQs

**Q:  What is parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC)?**
A: PNAC is a liver disorder that occurs in some infants and children receiving long-term intravenous nutrition.  It can cause jaundice and other symptoms.

**Q: How is fish oil triglycerides administered?**
A: It's administered intravenously (IV) as a slow infusion.

**Q: What should I do if my child experiences side effects?**
A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately.  Some side effects can be serious.

**Q: How should I store fish oil triglycerides?**
A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the product label.
