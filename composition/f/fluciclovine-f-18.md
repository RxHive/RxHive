# Fluciclovine F 18
### Generic Name
Fluciclovine F-18

### Usage
Fluciclovine F-18 is a radioactive diagnostic agent used in positron emission tomography (PET) scans.  Its primary use is in men who have previously been treated for prostate cancer and now have elevated levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in their blood, suggesting a possible recurrence of the cancer.  The scan helps to locate the potential site(s) of recurrence.  It is not used to diagnose prostate cancer initially or to treat it; its purpose is solely diagnostic.

### Dosage
**Diagnostic Imaging (Adults):** The standard intravenous (IV) dose is 370 MBq (10 mCi). PET scanning should begin 3-5 minutes after the injection is complete.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Fluciclovine F-18 have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are specified in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):

*   Dysgeusia (distorted taste)
*   Erythema (redness) at the injection site
*   Pain at the injection site

Less common, but potentially serious side effects:  Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), and the potential for cancer due to radiation accumulation are theoretical risks.  Any adverse reaction should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Fluciclovine F-18 is a radiotracer.  It's designed to accumulate in areas of the body with high metabolic activity, such as prostate cancer cells.  After intravenous injection, the tracer is taken up by these cells. A PET scan then detects this uptake, allowing visualization of potential areas of prostate cancer recurrence.  The intensity of the uptake is compared to surrounding tissues to determine if it's suggestive of cancer.  It's important to understand that Fluciclovine F-18 uptake is not specific to prostate cancer; it can occur in other cancers or benign conditions.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients have an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and potential cancer due to radiation accumulation.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Fluciclovine F-18 is not indicated for use in pregnant women.  It is unknown whether it is excreted in breast milk.
* **Other Precautions:** Patients should avoid eating or drinking (except for small amounts of water for medication) for at least 4 hours before the injection and refrain from significant exercise for at least one day prior. They should void their bladder about 30-60 minutes before the injection and hold urine until the scan is complete. Appropriate precautions for handling and disposal of radioactive materials must be followed.


### FAQs

* **Q: How accurate is a Fluciclovine F-18 PET scan?** A:  A negative scan doesn't rule out recurrent prostate cancer, and a positive scan doesn't definitively confirm it.  Results are interpreted in conjunction with other clinical information, including PSA levels and patient history.
* **Q: What should I expect during the scan?** A: You will receive an IV injection and then lie still for the scan duration.  You may experience a slight burning sensation at the injection site.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects from Fluciclovine F-18?** A: The radiation dose from Fluciclovine F-18 is relatively low, and significant long-term effects are unlikely.  However, any concerns should be discussed with your doctor.
* **Q: How is the Fluciclovine F-18 disposed of?** A:  Disposal follows strict radiation safety protocols that are handled by the medical facility.  You do not need to worry about disposal.
