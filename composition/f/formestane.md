# Formestane
### Generic Name
Formestane

### Usage
Formestane is a steroidal aromatase inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women.  Its mechanism involves blocking the production of estrogen, a hormone that fuels the growth of many breast cancers.  It's important to note that Formestane is no longer widely available due to the development of newer, more effective aromatase inhibitors.  It was never approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).


### Dosage
Because Formestane is no longer commercially available, specific dosage information is not readily accessible.  Previously, it was administered as an intramuscular injection, with the dosage regimen varying based on the individual patient and their response to treatment.  Any information found regarding specific dosages should be considered outdated and unreliable for current medical practice.  Consult with an oncologist for appropriate and current treatment options for breast cancer.


### Side Effects
Since Formestane is no longer available, a comprehensive list of side effects based on current usage is not possible.  However, based on past use, potential side effects could have included:

* **Common:**  Information unavailable due to the drug's unavailability.
* **Serious (Less Common):** Information unavailable due to the drug's unavailability.  Any serious side effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

**Disclaimer:**  This information is based on historical data and should not be used as a guide for current treatment.


### How it Works
Formestane works by irreversibly inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Aromatase is responsible for converting androgens (male hormones) into estrogens (female hormones). By blocking this conversion, Formestane significantly reduces the amount of estrogen in the body.  This reduction in estrogen levels helps to slow or stop the growth of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells that rely on estrogen for their growth and survival.


### Precautions
Because Formestane is no longer available, specific current precautions cannot be provided. However, based on its mechanism and past use, potential precautions would have included:

* **Contraindications:**  Information unavailable due to the drug's unavailability.  Prior medical history would have played a significant role in determining suitability.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Information unavailable due to the drug's unavailability. Potential interactions with other medications would have needed to be carefully considered.
* **Specific Warnings:** Information unavailable due to the drug's unavailability.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women would not have been candidates for this treatment.  Older adults or those with pre-existing conditions would have required careful monitoring.
