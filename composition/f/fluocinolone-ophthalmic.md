# Fluocinolone (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Fluocinolone (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Fluocinolone ophthalmic, administered as an intravitreal implant, is primarily used to treat two specific eye conditions: chronic noninfectious uveitis and diabetic macular edema.  Chronic noninfectious uveitis is inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye, which can cause significant vision impairment. Diabetic macular edema is swelling in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision, often a complication of diabetes.  The implant's sustained release of fluocinolone aims to reduce inflammation and associated vision problems in these conditions.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The dosage varies depending on the specific condition and the type of implant used.  Precise administration requires the expertise of an ophthalmologist.

* **Diabetic macular edema:** A single 0.19 mg implant is injected into the affected eye. This implant is designed to release fluocinolone at an initial rate of 0.25 mcg daily for 36 months.

* **Chronic noninfectious uveitis:**  Treatment involves either:
    * A single 0.59 mg silicone-encased tablet surgically implanted into the posterior segment of the affected eye. This tablet releases fluocinolone at a rate that decreases over 30 days to a steady-state release of 0.3-0.4 mcg/day for 30 months. Reimplantation might be necessary if uveitis recurs, indicating implant depletion.
    * A single 0.18 mg implant injected into the affected eye. This implant releases fluocinolone at an initial rate of 0.25 mcg/day for 36 months.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of fluocinolone ophthalmic implants in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dose adjustments for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Fluocinolone is a corticosteroid with intermediate potency.  It works by suppressing the body's inflammatory response. Specifically, it inhibits the formation, release, and activity of inflammatory mediators like kinins, histamine, and prostaglandins.  This action helps reduce inflammation in the eye, thereby alleviating the symptoms and complications of chronic noninfectious uveitis and diabetic macular edema.  The sustained-release mechanism of the implant provides prolonged therapeutic benefit.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fluocinolone ophthalmic implants are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fluocinolone or other corticosteroids; those with glaucoma and a cup-to-disc ratio greater than 0.8; those with active or suspected ocular or periocular infections (including most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva); and those with active bacterial, mycobacterial, or fungal eye infections.

* **Warnings:**  Increased risk of cataract formation, increased intraocular pressure and glaucoma, immunosuppression, and other ocular effects exists.

* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution in patients with a history of eye infections, glaucoma, or those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.  The information regarding excretion in breast milk is unknown.

* **Drug Interactions:** Fluocinolone may interact with other medications.  For instance, it may enhance the hyperglycemic effect of ceritinib, and ophthalmic NSAIDs may enhance its adverse effects. Discuss all medications with a healthcare provider before using fluocinolone implants.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the fluocinolone implant last?**  A: The duration varies depending on the implant type and the specific condition being treated; it ranges from 30 to 36 months.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your ophthalmologist or healthcare provider immediately to report any side effects.

* **Q: Can I use other eye drops with the fluocinolone implant?** A:  Discuss this with your doctor. Some medications might interact with fluocinolone or interfere with its effectiveness.

* **Q: How is the implant administered?** A: Fluocinolone ophthalmic implants are administered via intravitreal injection or surgical implantation by an ophthalmologist in a sterile environment.

* **Q: How should I store the implant?** A: Follow the instructions provided by your ophthalmologist and the manufacturer's labeling.
