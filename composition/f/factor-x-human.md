# Factor X Human
### Generic Name
Coagulation Factor X (Human)

### Usage
Coagulation Factor X (human) is a plasma-derived medication used to prevent and treat bleeding episodes in individuals with hereditary Factor X deficiency. This includes both children and adults.  It's primarily used for treating bleeding events but also plays a crucial role in the perioperative management (before, during, and after surgery) of bleeding in patients with mild to moderate Factor X deficiency.  It's important to note that its use in major surgery for patients with severe Factor X deficiency hasn't been extensively studied.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Dosage, frequency, and duration depend heavily on the location and severity of bleeding, the patient's overall health, and their response to treatment.  One unit of Factor X per kilogram of body weight generally increases circulating Factor X levels by approximately 2 units/dL in adults and about 1.7 units/dL in children under 12.  Always follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Bleeding Episodes (Treatment):**  The typical initial dose is 25 units/kg. This may be repeated every 24 hours until bleeding stops. Alternatively, a healthcare professional may calculate a patient-specific dose to reach a target peak Factor X level. The maximum daily dose is 60 units/kg.  Target trough levels are generally 10-20 units/dL, but higher levels (>40 units/dL) may be considered.

* **Bleeding Episodes (Prophylaxis):** An initial dose of 25 units/kg is given twice weekly. Dosage adjustments are made based on the patient's response and trough Factor X levels (aiming for ≥5 units/dL), not exceeding a peak of 120 units/dL.

* **Perioperative Management:** Before surgery, a calculated dose aims to raise Factor X levels to 70-90 units/dL. After surgery, the goal is to maintain levels at ≥50 units/dL until the risk of bleeding subsides.  The maximum daily dose remains 60 units/kg. Dosage calculations often use a formula based on body weight and desired Factor X increase.

**Children:**

* Dosages for children vary based on age (<12 years or ≥12 years) and follow a similar pattern to adult dosing, but with adjusted initial doses and formulas for calculating the required amount based on body weight and desired Factor X increase.  Always consult a pediatrician or healthcare professional for precise dosing instructions in pediatric patients.

**Administration:** Coagulation Factor X (human) is administered intravenously (IV).  Specific instructions for reconstitution and infusion rate should be followed carefully.


### Side Effects

* Fatigue
* Back pain
* Infusion-site reaction
* Infusion-site pain
* Anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Hypersensitivity reactions


It's crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately if any adverse effects occur.  While less common, serious side effects such as severe allergic reactions are possible.


### How it Works

Coagulation Factor X (human) is a replacement therapy for individuals lacking sufficient Factor X, a vital protein in the blood clotting cascade. Factor X is typically inactive until activated by other clotting factors. Once activated (to Factor Xa), it forms part of a complex that converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin is then essential for the formation of a stable fibrin clot, stopping bleeding.  By supplying the missing Factor X, this medication helps restore normal blood clotting.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:**  This medication is derived from human plasma and carries a risk of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.  Patients with a history of severe reactions should not use this medication.

* **Inhibitors:**  The body might develop antibodies (inhibitors) that neutralize the effects of Factor X.  Regular monitoring is important.

* **Infectious Diseases:** Because it’s derived from human plasma, there's a theoretical risk of transmitting infectious agents, although rigorous screening and processing significantly reduce this risk.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While Factor X levels may naturally increase during pregnancy, women with severe Factor X deficiency are still at risk of bleeding. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with a healthcare provider, weighing the benefits against potential risks.


* **Drug Interactions:**  Concurrent use of anticoagulants (especially those inhibiting Factor Xa) may reduce the effectiveness of Coagulation Factor X (human).

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Specific dosage adjustments for patients with liver or kidney problems are not specified in current guidelines.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is this medication stored?** A: Storage instructions vary depending on the specific product, so carefully check the product label and packaging.

* **Q:  How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action depends on the dose and the patient's individual response.  Effects are usually seen relatively quickly following intravenous administration.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to determine the appropriate course of action.  Do not attempt to double up on doses.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A: Long-term effects are uncommon, but regular monitoring for adverse reactions and inhibitor formation is recommended.

* **Q: What if I experience an allergic reaction?** A:  Stop taking the medication immediately and seek medical attention. Allergic reactions can range from mild to severe (anaphylaxis), so prompt treatment is crucial.
