# Fomepizole
### Generic Name
Fomepizole

### Usage
Fomepizole is a medication used to treat poisoning caused by methanol or ethylene glycol.  It works by blocking the enzymes in the body that convert these alcohols into toxic substances. This prevents the development of serious complications associated with methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning, such as metabolic acidosis, kidney failure, and central nervous system depression.  Fomepizole is often used in conjunction with other supportive treatments such as hemodialysis, particularly in severe cases.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Fomepizole treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion.

**Adult Dosage (Ethylene glycol/methanol toxicity):**

* **Initial Dose:** 15 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV).
* **Maintenance Dose:**  10 mg/kg every 12 hours for four doses, followed by 15 mg/kg every 12 hours until:
    * Ethylene glycol or methanol levels are less than 20 mg/dL.
    * The patient is asymptomatic.
    * Blood pH is normal.

**Pediatric Dosage (Ethylene glycol/methanol toxicity - off-label use):**

The dosage for children is the same as for adults. However, it's crucial to note that this is an off-label use, meaning it's not officially approved by regulatory bodies for use in children but is sometimes used by clinicians based on their professional judgment and the child's specific needs.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dose adjustments for patients with liver problems. Close monitoring is vital.
* **Renal Impairment:** Hemodialysis should be considered alongside Fomepizole for patients with kidney failure, significant or worsening metabolic acidosis, or ethylene glycol/methanol levels â‰¥50 mg/dL.  The dosing schedule changes during and after hemodialysis, requiring careful adherence to modified guidelines provided by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nausea

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Tachycardia (fast heart rate)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Seizures
* Allergic reactions
* Changes in liver enzyme levels

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list. Any unusual or concerning side effects should be reported immediately to a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Fomepizole acts as an antidote by inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the body that metabolizes methanol and ethylene glycol. By blocking this enzyme, Fomepizole prevents the formation of toxic metabolites (formaldehyde from methanol and glycolic acid/oxalic acid from ethylene glycol) responsible for the serious complications associated with these types of poisoning.  This allows the body to naturally eliminate the ingested alcohols.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fomepizole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fomepizole or any of its components.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with impaired liver or kidney function, and in pediatric patients (off-label use).  Close monitoring is essential in these populations.
* **Drug Interactions:** Fomepizole can reduce the rate of ethanol (alcohol) excretion.  Concurrent use with ethanol is not recommended.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Fomepizole is categorized as Pregnancy Category C (potential risk to fetus cannot be ruled out). The excretion in breast milk is unknown, hence use during breastfeeding should be approached with caution and under close medical supervision.


### FAQs

**Q: How is Fomepizole administered?**

A: Fomepizole is administered intravenously (IV) as a slow infusion, never as a bolus injection or undiluted.

**Q: How long does treatment usually last?**

A: The duration of treatment depends on the severity of the poisoning and the patient's response.  Treatment typically continues until toxin levels are below a safe threshold and the patient is clinically stable.

**Q: What should I do if I suspect someone has ingested methanol or ethylene glycol?**

A:  Seek immediate medical attention. Call emergency services or go to the nearest hospital.  Time is critical in these types of poisonings.

**Q: Is Fomepizole safe for everyone?**

A: While generally safe when used as directed, Fomepizole, like all medications, carries potential risks.  It's crucial to discuss its use with a healthcare provider to assess individual risks and benefits.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should carefully discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors.

**Q: How is Fomepizole stored?**

A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by the pharmacist or on the product label.
