# Fenoprofen
### Generic Name
Fenoprofen

### Usage
Fenoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in adults.  It's also used to treat mild to moderate pain in adults.  While primarily used for these conditions, it's important to note that fenoprofen is not a first-line treatment for all types of pain or inflammatory conditions.  Always consult a healthcare professional to determine if fenoprofen is the appropriate medication for your specific needs.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual's response to the medication.  It's crucial to follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Adults:**

* **Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis:** The usual dose is 400-600 mg three or four times daily (TID or QID). The total daily dose should not exceed 3200 mg.  Your doctor may adjust the dosage based on your individual needs and response.

* **Mild to Moderate Pain:** The typical dose is 200 mg every 4-6 hours as needed for pain relief.  Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dosage.

**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of fenoprofen have not been established in children.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment or mild to moderate renal (kidney) impairment; however, caution is advised, and use is contraindicated in individuals with significantly impaired kidney function.  Fenoprofen is not removed by hemodialysis.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of users):**

* Nervous system: Drowsiness, headache, dizziness, nervousness, fatigue, confusion
* Cardiovascular: Peripheral edema (swelling), palpitations

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in less than 1% of users, based on post-marketing data and case reports):**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), serious skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), blood disorders (anemia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis), liver damage (hepatotoxicity), kidney problems (renal failure), gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers, cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke).

If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Fenoprofen is a non-selective NSAID that inhibits the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2.  These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which play a significant role in inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, fenoprofen decreases inflammation, pain, and fever.  Additional mechanisms of action may contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects, such as modulation of immune cell activity.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fenoprofen is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components; a history of asthma, urticaria (hives), or allergic-type reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs;  in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery; and those with significantly impaired kidney function.
* **Interactions:**  Fenoprofen can interact with numerous medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, lithium, and other NSAIDs.  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Fenoprofen is categorized as Pregnancy Category C (first and second trimesters) and Category D (third trimester).  Use during pregnancy, particularly in the later stages, should be avoided unless the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.  Fenoprofen is excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised if breastfeeding.
* **Elderly and Vulnerable Populations:** Elderly patients and individuals with existing health conditions like heart, liver, or kidney disease may be at increased risk of adverse effects.  Close monitoring is essential.
* **Other Precautions:**  Avoid alcohol consumption while taking fenoprofen, as it can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Use caution when operating machinery or driving, as drowsiness or dizziness may occur.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take fenoprofen with other pain relievers?** A:  It's best to consult your doctor before combining fenoprofen with other medications, especially other NSAIDs or pain relievers, to avoid potential interactions and adverse effects.

* **Q: How should I store fenoprofen?** A: Store fenoprofen at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: How long does it take for fenoprofen to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the individual and the dosage, but generally, you should begin to feel relief within 30 to 60 minutes after taking the medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I stop taking fenoprofen suddenly?** A: It's generally advisable to gradually reduce your dosage under your doctor's guidance rather than stopping abruptly.  Sudden discontinuation can sometimes lead to withdrawal symptoms or exacerbations of underlying conditions.

* **Q: Is fenoprofen addictive?** A: Fenoprofen is not considered addictive in the same way as opioid pain relievers. However, long-term use should always be monitored by a physician.
