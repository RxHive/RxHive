# Flurbiprofen + Gatifloxacin
While Flurbiprofen and Gatifloxacin are both medications, they are not typically combined into a single generic medicine.  They address different health concerns and are prescribed separately.  Therefore, providing a single composition description as requested is not possible.  However, individual information about each drug can be given:

### Flurbiprofen

**Generic Name:** Flurbiprofen

**Usage:** Flurbiprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.  Its main uses include treating:

* **Osteoarthritis:** Reducing pain and inflammation in joints affected by osteoarthritis.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis:** Similar to osteoarthritis, it helps manage pain and inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
* **Dental pain:**  Provides relief from post-operative dental pain and inflammation.
* **Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea):** Alleviates pain and discomfort.
* **Tendinitis and bursitis:** Reduces inflammation and pain in tendons and bursae.

**Dosage:** Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, and overall health.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescription precisely.  Flurbiprofen is typically available as tablets and capsules for oral administration.  Specific dosages must be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Heartburn
* Stomach upset
* Dizziness
* Headache
*  Increased risk of bleeding or bruising

Less common but serious side effects include allergic reactions, kidney problems, and cardiovascular events.

**How it Works:** Flurbiprofen works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to pain and inflammation. By reducing prostaglandin levels, Flurbiprofen alleviates pain and reduces swelling.

**Precautions:**  Flurbiprofen should be used cautiously in individuals with a history of stomach ulcers, kidney problems, heart conditions, or allergies to NSAIDs.  It should be avoided during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, and breastfeeding unless explicitly advised by a doctor.  Interactions with other medications, including blood thinners, are possible.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take Flurbiprofen with alcohol?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking Flurbiprofen as it can increase the risk of stomach upset and bleeding.
* **Q: How should I store Flurbiprofen?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the next dose. Never double the dose.


### Gatifloxacin

**Generic Name:** Gatifloxacin

**Usage:** Gatifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections.  Its primary uses include:

* **Community-acquired pneumonia:** Bacterial infection of the lungs.
* **Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis:** Worsening of a chronic lung condition due to bacteria.
* **Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections:** Infections affecting the skin and underlying tissues.

**Dosage:** The dosage of Gatifloxacin varies depending on the infection being treated and the patient's age and health. It's usually administered orally as a tablet.  Specific dosages and duration must be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)

Less common but serious side effects include tendonitis, tendon rupture, and peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage).

**How it Works:** Gatifloxacin works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and cell division. This action leads to bacterial cell death.

**Precautions:** Gatifloxacin should be used cautiously in patients with a history of tendon problems, seizures, or central nervous system disorders. It should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless specifically recommended by a physician.  It can interact with other medications.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can Gatifloxacin treat viral infections?** A: No, Gatifloxacin is only effective against bacterial infections.
* **Q: How long does it take to see improvement after starting Gatifloxacin?** A:  Improvement typically occurs within a few days, but the full course of treatment must be completed.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience a serious side effect?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.
