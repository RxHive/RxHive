# Fluticasone Furoate + Oxymetazoline

**Generic Name:** Fluticasone Furoate + Oxymetazoline nasal spray

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to relieve nasal congestion and symptoms of seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  It's typically used for short-term treatment of symptoms.  Fluticasone furoate is a corticosteroid that reduces nasal inflammation, while oxymetazoline is a decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nose.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects may include:

* **Burning or stinging sensation in the nose:** This is often temporary and lessens with continued use.
* **Nosebleeds:**  Especially with prolonged or excessive use.
* **Headache:**  Relatively common, usually mild.
* **Dryness or irritation in the nose:**  May lead to crusting or discomfort.
* **Bad taste in the mouth:**  A relatively common side effect.
* **Sneezing:** Paradoxically, some individuals may experience increased sneezing initially.


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Systemic corticosteroid effects (rare, especially with prolonged high doses):** These can include increased blood sugar, cataracts, glaucoma, thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), and changes in mood or behavior.  This is less likely with nasal spray compared to oral corticosteroids.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, hives, itching, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these.
* **Rebound congestion:**  This is a worsening of congestion after stopping the medication.  It's more likely with prolonged or excessive use of oxymetazoline.

This is not an exhaustive list. Consult the patient information leaflet for a complete list of potential side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Fluticasone Furoate:** This is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation in the nasal passages.  It decreases the swelling of the nasal lining, thereby reducing congestion and other allergy symptoms like sneezing and runny nose.

* **Oxymetazoline:** This is a decongestant that shrinks the blood vessels in the nasal passages. This reduces swelling and opens up the airways, providing quick relief from nasal congestion.
