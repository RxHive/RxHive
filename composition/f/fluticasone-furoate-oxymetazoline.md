# Fluticasone Furoate + Oxymetazoline
### Generic Name
Fluticasone Furoate + Oxymetazoline


### Usage

Fluticasone furoate + oxymetazoline is a combination nasal spray used to treat nasal congestion and inflammation associated with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and the common cold.  Fluticasone furoate is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the nasal passages, while oxymetazoline is a decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels, relieving stuffiness. This combination tackles both the inflammatory and congestion aspects of nasal symptoms.  While primarily used for short-term relief of cold symptoms and seasonal allergies, it can also offer some benefit in managing persistent allergic rhinitis when used as directed by a physician.  It's important to note that this combination is not intended for long-term use due to the potential for rebound congestion with the decongestant component.


### Dosage

**Dosage information should always be obtained from your physician or pharmacist as it is crucial to follow their specific instructions.**  The typical dosage for adults and children over 12 years old is one spray in each nostril once or twice daily.  Children under 12 should not use this medication unless specifically prescribed by a doctor.  The medication comes as a nasal spray; it is not available in oral or IV forms.  Do not exceed the recommended dose.  Do not use this medication for longer than 3-7 days without consulting a healthcare professional.  Prolonged use can lead to rebound congestion, where your nasal congestion worsens after stopping the medication.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

*   Burning or stinging sensation in the nose
*   Headache
*   Nosebleeds
*   Dryness in the nose
*   Bad taste in the mouth

Less common, but more serious, side effects are possible and necessitate immediate medical attention.  These may include:

*   Increased heart rate
*   High blood pressure
*   Irregular heartbeat
*   Difficulty breathing
*   Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, discontinue use and contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Fluticasone furoate works by reducing inflammation in the nasal passages.  It's a corticosteroid that binds to receptors within nasal cells, suppressing the release of inflammatory substances that cause swelling, itching, and congestion. Oxymetazoline, a sympathomimetic amine, acts as a decongestant by constricting blood vessels in the nasal lining. This vasoconstriction reduces swelling, allowing for easier airflow and relief from nasal congestion.  The combination provides both anti-inflammatory and decongestant effects for comprehensive symptom relief.
