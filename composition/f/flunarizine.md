# Flunarizine
### Generic Name
Flunarizine

### Usage
Flunarizine is primarily used for the prevention (prophylaxis) of migraine headaches, both with and without aura, in adults.  It's specifically indicated for individuals experiencing frequent and severe migraine attacks that haven't responded well to other treatments or where the side effects of other medications are unacceptable.  It's crucial to understand that flunarizine does *not* treat acute migraine attacks; it's solely for preventing future attacks.

### Dosage
**Adults (<65 years):** The typical oral dose is 10 mg once daily, usually taken at bedtime.  Some off-label prescribing may involve 5-10mg daily. To potentially reduce side effects, some clinicians may recommend taking the medication for only 5 days a week, with two consecutive medication-free days.  If there's no significant improvement after three months of treatment, the medication should be discontinued.

**Adults (â‰¥65 years):** The safety and effectiveness of flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis in elderly individuals haven't been established.  Use in this age group requires careful consideration and monitoring by a healthcare professional.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of flunarizine in children under 18 years of age haven't been established. It's not recommended for use in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised when using flunarizine in individuals with liver problems.  Always consult a doctor before taking flunarizine if you have any kidney or liver issues.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Weight gain
* Headache
* Depression
* Upset stomach
* Dry mouth
* Insomnia
* Extrapyramidal reactions (movement disorders)
* Galactorrhea (abnormal milk production)
* Skin rash
* Muscle pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Increased appetite


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, warrant immediate medical attention.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Flunarizine is a calcium channel blocker. It works by reducing the excessive influx of calcium ions into cells. This action helps to stabilize the membranes of brain cells and reduces the release of certain chemicals that trigger migraine attacks.  Flunarizine also possesses antihistamine properties, although its primary mechanism in migraine prevention is related to calcium channel blockage.  It reduces the *frequency* of migraines rather than significantly impacting the duration or intensity of individual attacks.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Flunarizine is contraindicated (absolutely should not be used) in individuals with a history of depression, Parkinson's disease, other extrapyramidal disorders, or hypersensitivity to flunarizine or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Flunarizine can interact with numerous other medications, including CNS depressants (such as alcohol, sedatives, and tranquilizers),  antipsychotics, and certain antidepressants. This interaction can increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Flunarizine is categorized as pregnancy Category C, meaning the risk to the fetus is not fully established. Breastfeeding while using flunarizine is not recommended due to the uncertainty about its excretion in breast milk.
* **Other Precautions:**  Use caution in patients with hepatic impairment.  Individuals taking flunarizine should avoid tasks requiring alertness, such as driving or operating machinery, especially during the initial phase of treatment.  Long-term use may increase the risk of weight gain.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take flunarizine for an acute migraine attack?** A: No, flunarizine is a preventative medication, not a treatment for acute migraine attacks.  Use a specific acute migraine medication as prescribed by your doctor for immediate relief.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from flunarizine?** A: It usually takes several weeks of regular use before the full preventative effects of flunarizine are noticeable.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: How should I store flunarizine?** A: Store flunarizine as directed on the medication label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I stop taking flunarizine suddenly?** A:  No. Consult your physician before discontinuing flunarizine; sudden cessation might result in a rebound effect of increased migraine frequency.  They can help you gradually reduce the dosage to minimize any potential withdrawal symptoms.
