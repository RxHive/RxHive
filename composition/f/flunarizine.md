# Flunarizine

**Generic Name:** Flunarizine

**Usage:**

Flunarizine is a calcium channel blocker primarily used to prevent migraine headaches and vertigo (dizziness) associated with Ménière's disease and other vestibular disorders.  It's also sometimes used off-label for other conditions involving impaired cerebral blood flow, though this use is less common and requires careful consideration by a physician.  It's important to note that it's not a treatment for acute migraine attacks; it's a preventative medication.

**Side Effects:**

Flunarizine can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less so.  These can include:

* **Common:**  Weight gain, drowsiness, fatigue, depression, extrapyramidal symptoms (such as Parkinsonism-like symptoms: tremors, rigidity, slow movement), and galactorrhea (abnormal milk production).
* **Less Common but More Serious:**  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) – a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by muscle rigidity, high fever, and altered mental status;  tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements, particularly of the face and tongue – usually develops after long-term use); liver dysfunction; blood disorders.

It's crucial to report any unusual or concerning side effects to a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:**

Flunarizine is a calcium channel blocker with multiple mechanisms of action believed to contribute to its effectiveness in preventing migraine and vertigo:

* **Calcium Channel Blockade:** It blocks calcium channels in smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). This improved blood flow is thought to help prevent migraine attacks, particularly those related to vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels).
* **Stabilization of Neuronal Membranes:** Flunarizine also affects neuronal membranes, reducing their excitability. This can help stabilize the vestibular system (involved in balance and spatial orientation), potentially reducing vertigo episodes.
* **Serotonin Modulation (Possibly):** Some studies suggest that it might also interact with serotonin pathways, though this mechanism is less well-understood.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The full benefit of flunarizine usually takes several weeks to develop.  It's important to continue taking it as prescribed even if you don't notice immediate improvement.
* **Q: Can I take it with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible. Certain medications, particularly those affecting the central nervous system, may increase the risk of side effects.
* **Q: Can I stop taking it suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping flunarizine suddenly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  It should be discontinued gradually under the supervision of a physician.
* **Q: Is it safe for everyone?** A: No. Flunarizine is not suitable for everyone, particularly individuals with certain medical conditions (e.g., severe liver or kidney disease, Parkinson's disease, depression) or those taking specific medications.  A doctor will assess your suitability for this drug.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
