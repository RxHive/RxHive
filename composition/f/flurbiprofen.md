# Flurbiprofen
### Generic Name
Flurbiprofen

### Usage
Flurbiprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.  Its main application is in treating mild to moderate pain, including menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea), dental pain, and other types of musculoskeletal pain such as arthritis, sprains, and strains.  It's also sometimes used to reduce inflammation associated with certain conditions, but this is generally less common than its analgesic (pain-relieving) role.  It's important to note that while it can reduce fever, this isn't typically its primary clinical use.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation (tablet, capsule, topical gel, or injection), the individual's age, weight, and the severity of the condition.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  There is no standard children's dosage widely available as it's primarily used in adults.  Pediatric use should only be determined by a healthcare professional.

* **Oral (Adults):**  Typical doses range from 50mg to 100mg, taken two to three times daily.  The total daily dose should not exceed 300mg unless otherwise directed by a doctor.
* **Topical (Adults):**  Topical gels and creams are applied directly to the affected area as directed on the product labeling.  This dosage will vary based on the product concentration.
* **IV (Adults):** Intravenous administration is not a typical route for flurbiprofen and is usually only used in specific clinical settings under the close supervision of a healthcare professional. Dosage and frequency would be determined on a case-by-case basis.

### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Upset stomach
* Nausea
* Heartburn
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Constipation
* Diarrhea

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Stomach ulcers
* Bleeding in the stomach or intestines

* Liver or kidney problems


If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, consult your doctor or other healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Flurbiprofen works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever.  By reducing prostaglandin production, flurbiprofen helps to alleviate pain and reduce swelling and inflammation at the site of injury or illness.


### Precautions
* **Allergy:** Do not use flurbiprofen if you are allergic to it or to other NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen.
* **Pregnant or breastfeeding women:** Use should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Consult a doctor before using this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Children:**  The use of flurbiprofen in children is not typically recommended due to a lack of sufficient data and potential risks.
* **Older adults:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of flurbiprofen, particularly those related to the stomach, kidneys, and heart.
* **Interactions:** Flurbiprofen may interact with certain medications, including blood thinners, other NSAIDs, and some diuretics. Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.
* **Stomach problems:** Patients with a history of stomach ulcers or bleeding should use flurbiprofen with caution.
* **Kidney or liver disease:**  Use with caution in patients with kidney or liver problems.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take flurbiprofen with alcohol?** A: Combining flurbiprofen with alcohol can increase the risk of stomach irritation and bleeding. It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.
