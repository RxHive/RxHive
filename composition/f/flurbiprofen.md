# Flurbiprofen

**Generic Name:** Flurbiprofen

**Usage:**

Flurbiprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.  Its specific uses include:

* **Relief of mild to moderate pain:** This can include pain from headaches, menstrual cramps, dental procedures, and other sources of musculoskeletal pain.
* **Reduction of inflammation:** It's effective in reducing swelling, redness, and pain associated with inflammation.
* **Treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis:** Flurbiprofen helps manage the pain and inflammation associated with these conditions.

It's important to note that flurbiprofen is available in different formulations (e.g., tablets, capsules, topical gels/creams) depending on the intended use.  Always follow the prescribed dosage and route of administration.


**Side Effects:**

Like other NSAIDs, flurbiprofen can cause side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Heartburn, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and ulcers (in more serious cases).
* **Central nervous system effects:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, nervousness, insomnia.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling (especially of the face, lips, or tongue), difficulty breathing.
* **Cardiovascular effects:** Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and high blood pressure (particularly with long-term use or high doses).
* **Renal effects:** Reduced kidney function, particularly in individuals with pre-existing kidney problems.
* **Hepatic effects:** Liver damage (rare but serious).


This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and likelihood of side effects can vary depending on individual factors, dosage, and duration of use.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe side effects.


**How it Works:**

Flurbiprofen works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are substances in the body that trigger inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, flurbiprofen helps alleviate pain and inflammation.
