# Fenoldopam
### Generic Name
Fenoldopam

### Usage
Fenoldopam is a medication used for the short-term management of severe hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults and children.  In adults, it's used for up to 48 hours in a hospital setting when rapid and reversible blood pressure reduction is needed, particularly in cases of malignant hypertension with deteriorating organ function.  In children, its use is limited to a maximum of 4 hours in a hospital setting for short-term blood pressure reduction.  It works by directly relaxing blood vessels, particularly in the kidneys, leading to improved blood flow and a decrease in overall blood pressure.

### Dosage

**Adults (Severe Hypertension):**

* **Route:** Intravenous (IV) continuous infusion only.  Never administer as a bolus injection.  The medication must be diluted before infusion.
* **Initial Dose:** 0.01–0.3 mcg/kg/min
* **Maintenance Dose:** The dose is increased by 0.05–0.1 mcg/kg/min every 15 minutes until the desired blood pressure is reached.
* **Maximum Dose:** 1.6 mcg/kg/min.  Treatment should not exceed 48 hours.
* **Concomitant Therapy:** Oral antihypertensive medications may be added during or after the Fenoldopam infusion.

**Children (Severe Hypertension):**

* **Route:** Intravenous (IV) continuous infusion only, administered using an infusion pump.
* **Initial Dose:** 0.2 mcg/kg/min
* **Maintenance Dose:** The dose is increased by 0.3–0.5 mcg/kg/min every 20–30 minutes until the desired blood pressure is reached.
* **Maximum Dose:** 0.8 mcg/kg/min. Treatment should not exceed 48 hours.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Fenoldopam is a selective dopamine receptor agonist, specifically targeting D1 receptors in blood vessels. By activating these receptors, it causes relaxation and widening of the blood vessels (vasodilation), primarily in the kidneys. This vasodilation reduces peripheral vascular resistance, resulting in lower blood pressure.  It also increases renal blood flow, promoting diuresis (increased urination) and natriuresis (increased excretion of sodium).  This combination contributes to the overall reduction in blood pressure.  Fenoldopam is significantly more potent than dopamine in causing renal vasodilation and has minimal effects on the adrenergic system.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  Fenoldopam is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Fenoldopam or any component of the formulation (such as sulfites).

**Increased Risk:**  Fenoldopam may increase the risk of hypokalemia (low potassium), tachycardia (fast heart rate), and increased intraocular pressure (especially in patients with glaucoma or intraocular hypertension).  Allergic reactions associated with sulfites are also a potential concern.

**Use with Caution:**  Fenoldopam should be used with caution in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease or active angina pectoris, and in patients with intraocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.

**Drug Interactions:**  Fenoldopam may enhance the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.  Concomitant use should be avoided.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Fenoldopam is categorized as Pregnancy Category B. The effects on a nursing infant are unknown; the decision to discontinue breastfeeding or the medication should be made considering the benefits of treatment for the mother.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take Fenoldopam with food?** A:  This medication is given intravenously, so food intake is not a factor.

**Q: How is Fenoldopam stored?** A: Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions.

**Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action is relatively rapid, but the exact timeframe will vary depending on the individual and the dose.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Fenoldopam is administered intravenously and continuously by healthcare professionals, so missing a dose is not applicable in this context.  Contact your doctor immediately if you have any concerns about your treatment.

**Q: Can I stop taking Fenoldopam suddenly?** A:  Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided. The healthcare provider will manage the gradual reduction of the infusion rate as clinically indicated.
