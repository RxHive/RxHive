# Ferumoxytol
### Generic Name
Ferumoxytol

### Usage
Ferumoxytol is an intravenous (IV) iron medication used to treat iron deficiency anemia in adults.  It's primarily indicated for individuals who can't tolerate or haven't responded well to oral iron supplements, or those with chronic kidney disease.  While its primary use is in adult populations, it's crucial to note that its safety and effectiveness haven't been established in children.

### Dosage
Dosage is expressed in milligrams (mg) of elemental iron.  There are two main regimens:

* **Two-dose regimen:**  510 mg administered intravenously over at least 15 minutes.  This dose is repeated after 3-8 days.  A response assessment should be done at least 30 days after the second dose.  The regimen can be repeated if anemia persists or recurs.

* **Single-dose regimen:** 1020 mg (1.02 g) administered intravenously over approximately 30 minutes as a single dose.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Pediatric Use:**  Ferumoxytol's safety and efficacy haven't been established in children.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with liver problems.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for those with kidney impairment. However, for patients on hemodialysis, administer the dose at least one hour after dialysis concludes and once blood pressure has stabilized.


### Side Effects

### How it Works
Ferumoxytol is a type of intravenous iron preparation.  It's composed of superparamagnetic iron oxide coated with a carbohydrate. This complex enters the body's macrophages (immune cells) in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.  The iron is then released from this complex and either stored or transported via transferrin (an iron-transporting protein) to be incorporated into hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Ferumoxytol is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to Ferumoxytol, other intravenous iron products, or any component of the formulation.
* **Hypersensitivity Reactions:** There's a heightened risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including potentially fatal anaphylaxis.  Close monitoring is essential during and after administration.
* **Hypotension:**  Ferumoxytol can cause hypotension; blood pressure monitoring is crucial.
* **Drug Interactions:** Dimercaprol (used to treat heavy metal poisoning) may increase the risk of kidney damage when taken with Ferumoxytol.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ferumoxytol is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its effects on pregnancy are unknown.  Use during pregnancy should be carefully considered and ideally delayed until the second or third trimester if possible. The impact on breastfeeding isn't fully understood; a healthcare professional should help weigh the risks and benefits.
* **Other Considerations:**  Ferumoxytol can interfere with MRI scans, impacting the results for up to three months after administration.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Ferumoxytol administered?** A: It's given intravenously as a slow infusion over at least 15 minutes (longer for higher doses).

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  Response assessments are typically performed at least 30 days after the treatment course is complete.

* **Q: How should Ferumoxytol be stored?** A: Refer to the specific storage instructions on the product packaging.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A:  Long-term effects are not fully understood. Regular monitoring of blood work is often recommended.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss rescheduling.
