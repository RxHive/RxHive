# Flurbiprofen + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose
### Generic Name
Flurbiprofen + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used for the topical treatment of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease).  The flurbiprofen component is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works to reduce pain and inflammation directly at the site of application.  Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acts as a gel-forming agent, helping the flurbiprofen to adhere to the skin and provide prolonged relief. While primarily used for osteoarthritis pain, it might be considered for other localized inflammatory conditions at a physician's discretion, though this is not a standard use.  Always consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation and the manufacturer.  Always follow the directions provided on your prescription label.  Generally, a small amount of gel is applied directly to the affected area several times a day, as directed by your doctor.  

**There is no standard IV administration for this combination medication.** It's for topical use only.  Dosage for children is not typically established and this medication should generally be avoided in children unless specifically directed by a pediatrician.  The amount used should be based on the size of the affected area, not the patient's weight or age.  Avoid excessive use as this won't increase efficacy and could lead to increased side effects.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Skin irritation (burning, redness, itching), mild stinging or burning sensation at the application site.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), severe skin reactions.  While rare, systemic absorption of flurbiprofen can occur, leading to potential side effects similar to oral NSAIDs (see precautions).

**If you experience any adverse effects, stop using the medication and consult your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

Flurbiprofen, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are chemicals in the body that contribute to inflammation and pain. By reducing prostaglandin production at the site of application, flurbiprofen helps to decrease both pain and swelling associated with osteoarthritis.  The hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acts as a vehicle, allowing for controlled release and improved topical delivery of flurbiprofen.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to flurbiprofen, other NSAIDs, or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.  Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Although topical application minimizes systemic absorption, theoretically, it could interact with other NSAIDs or medications that affect blood clotting.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Warnings:**  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult their physician before using this medication.  It's generally not recommended for use in children unless specifically prescribed by a doctor.  Elderly individuals may be more susceptible to side effects and should use with caution.  Use only as directed.  Avoid using on open wounds or broken skin.


### FAQs
