# Flurbiprofen + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose

**Generic Name:** Flurbiprofen + Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) ophthalmic solution

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat the pain and inflammation associated with eye conditions such as:

* **Post-operative inflammation:** Following cataract surgery or other eye procedures.
* **Anterior uveitis:** Inflammation of the front part of the eye.
* **Other inflammatory eye conditions:** As directed by an ophthalmologist.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Burning or stinging:** Upon application.
* **Blurred vision:** Temporary.
* **Eye irritation:** Redness, itching.
* **Headache:** Less common.

Less common, but more serious side effects require immediate medical attention and include:

* **Severe allergic reactions:** Swelling of the face, lips, or tongue; difficulty breathing.
* **Increased eye pressure:**  (Glaucoma)
* **Corneal damage:**  This is rare but serious.


**How it Works:**

* **Flurbiprofen:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and swelling. In the eye, this reduces inflammation and pain.

* **Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC):** This is a viscosity-increasing agent.  It acts as a lubricant and helps the flurbiprofen solution stay in contact with the eye longer, improving its effectiveness.  It also helps to reduce irritation.

The combination provides both anti-inflammatory action (Flurbiprofen) and improved retention within the eye (HPMC).


**FAQs:**

* **How often should I use it?**  The frequency of application will be determined by your ophthalmologist, usually multiple times daily.  Follow the prescribed dosage instructions carefully.

* **How long will it take to work?**  You might experience some relief from pain and inflammation relatively quickly, but the full therapeutic effect may take a few days.

* **Can I wear contact lenses while using this medication?** Generally, it's best to avoid wearing contact lenses while using this medication, especially immediately after application.  Consult your ophthalmologist.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Can I use this medication if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Consult your doctor or ophthalmologist before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  The use of NSAIDs during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration.
