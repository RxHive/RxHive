# Flibanserin
### Generic Name
Flibanserin

### Usage
Flibanserin is used to treat premenopausal women with acquired, generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).  This means it's for women who have experienced a decrease in sexual desire that causes them significant distress or problems in their relationships.  This decreased desire must not be due to other medical or psychiatric conditions, relationship issues, or the effects of other medications.  It's crucial to understand that flibanserin is *not* used to treat HSDD in postmenopausal women or men, nor is it intended to enhance sexual performance.


### Dosage
The typical adult dose is 100 mg taken orally once daily at bedtime.  Treatment effectiveness should be evaluated after eight weeks.  If there's no improvement, the medication should be discontinued.  If a dose is missed, it should be taken at bedtime the following day; do not double the dose.  Flibanserin is not approved for use in children. Dosage adjustments are not typically needed for mild to severe renal impairment, but are contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.  If starting flibanserin after using a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, wait two weeks.  Conversely, if starting a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor after flibanserin, wait two days.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include dizziness and drowsiness.

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include:

*   Fatigue
*   Insomnia
*   Anxiety
*   Sedation
*   Vertigo
*   Nausea
*   Abdominal pain
*   Constipation
*   Dry mouth

Less common, but serious side effects reported post-marketing include appendicitis.  Any unusual or concerning side effect warrants immediate consultation with a healthcare provider.


### How it Works
The precise mechanism by which flibanserin treats hypoactive sexual desire disorder isn't fully understood. However, it's known to act on various serotonin receptors in the brain. It acts as an agonist (activator) at 5-HT1A receptors and an antagonist (blocker) at 5-HT2A receptors. It also shows moderate antagonist activity at other serotonin and dopamine receptors.  This complex interaction with neurotransmitters is believed to play a role in improving sexual desire in affected women.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Flibanserin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the medication or its components, those who consume alcohol, those using moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, those with hepatic impairment, those taking alcohol and having a resting systolic blood pressure below 110 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure below 60 mmHg, and those concurrently using P-glycoprotein substrates like digoxin.

**Warnings:**  There's a significantly increased risk of hypotension (low blood pressure) and syncope (fainting) when flibanserin is combined with alcohol or strong/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.  Because of this serious risk,  alcohol is strictly contraindicated with flibanserin.  Furthermore, flibanserin is contraindicated in patients with liver problems.  The medication should be used cautiously in individuals already prone to low blood pressure.

**Interactions:**  Concomitant use with opioid analgesics/CNS depressants enhances CNS depression. Combining flibanserin with CYP3A4 inhibitors (moderate/strong) or CYP2C19 inhibitors increases the risk of hypotension and syncope.  Use with CYP3A4 inducers decreases flibanserin efficacy.  Combining it with digoxin or other P-glycoprotein substrates increases toxicity.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Flibanserin may cause fetal harm.  Because its excretion in breast milk is unknown and there's a risk of sedation in infants, breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication.
