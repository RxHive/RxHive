# Fluconazole

**Generic Name:** Fluconazole

**Usage:** Fluconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat a variety of fungal infections, including:

* **Vaginal yeast infections (candidiasis):**  A common use, often a single dose is sufficient.
* **Oral thrush (candidiasis):**  Infection of the mouth and throat.
* **Esophageal candidiasis:** Infection of the esophagus (food pipe).
* **Cryptococcal meningitis:** A serious infection of the brain and spinal cord.
* **Coccidioidomycosis:** A fungal lung infection.
* **Histoplasmosis:** Another fungal lung infection.
* **Blastomycosis:**  A fungal infection that can affect the lungs, skin, and bones.
* **Systemic candidiasis:** A serious, widespread fungal infection.
* **Other fungal infections:**  Fluconazole may be used to treat other fungal infections as determined by a doctor.

**Important Note:** Fluconazole is a prescription medication.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a doctor based on the type and severity of the infection and the patient's overall health.  It should not be used without a prescription.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, fluconazole can cause side effects.  These can range from mild to severe. Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** A fairly frequent side effect.
* **Nausea:** Stomach upset.
* **Abdominal pain:**  Pain in the stomach area.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation.
* **Vomiting:**  Feeling sick to the stomach and throwing up.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Liver problems:**  Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, abdominal pain.
* **Kidney problems:** Changes in urination.
* **Blood disorders:**  Unusual bleeding or bruising.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Including potassium levels.

**How it Works:** Fluconazole is a triazole antifungal agent. It works by interfering with the production of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. By disrupting ergosterol synthesis, fluconazole weakens the fungal cell membrane, leading to cell death and inhibiting fungal growth.  This targeted action minimizes harm to human cells, though side effects can still occur.
