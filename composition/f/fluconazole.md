# Fluconazole
### Generic Name
Fluconazole

### Usage

Fluconazole is an antifungal medication primarily used to treat infections caused by *Candida* species, a type of yeast.  These infections can range from superficial (like thrush in the mouth or vagina) to serious systemic infections (like candidemia, affecting the bloodstream).  Fluconazole is also effective against *Cryptococcus neoformans*, a fungus that causes cryptococcal meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord).  Beyond these primary uses, fluconazole has off-label uses in treating other fungal infections, such as coccidioidomycosis (valley fever), histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis, though other antifungals are often preferred as first-line treatments for these conditions.  Its use in these cases is typically reserved for situations where other medications are ineffective or poorly tolerated.  Prophylactic use of fluconazole is also sometimes employed in high-risk individuals, such as those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, to prevent fungal infections.

### Dosage

Fluconazole dosage varies significantly depending on the type and severity of the infection, the patient's age, weight, and renal function.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  The medication comes in various forms: oral tablets, oral liquid suspension (syrup), and intravenous (IV) solution.

**Adults:**  Dosage for adults can range from a single 150mg dose for uncomplicated vaginal yeast infections to multiple daily doses of 400-800mg or more for serious systemic infections like candidemia or cryptococcal meningitis.  Treatment duration also varies widely, ranging from a few days to several months or even lifelong in certain conditions like chronic cryptococcal meningitis.  Dosage adjustments are often necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function.

**Children:**  Pediatric dosages are calculated based on weight (mg/kg) and the specific infection being treated.  Again,  a healthcare provider must determine the appropriate dose and duration of therapy.  Maximum daily doses exist to ensure safety.

**Administration:** Oral forms should be taken as directed.  IV administration requires careful monitoring and should only be performed by trained healthcare professionals.  IV infusion rates should not exceed 200mg per hour.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include headache.

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients may include:

* Skin rash
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dizziness
* Elevated liver enzyme levels


Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Prolonged QT interval on ECG (heart rhythm problems)
* Torsades de pointes (a type of irregular heartbeat)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (a life-threatening skin condition)
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Seizures

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.  Even seemingly minor side effects warrant discussion with your doctor or pharmacist.


### How it Works

Fluconazole is an azole antifungal that works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.  By interfering with ergosterol production, fluconazole weakens the fungal cell membrane, leading to cell death and ultimately preventing the growth and spread of the infection.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Fluconazole should not be used in individuals with a known allergy to fluconazole or other azoles.
* **Drug Interactions:** Fluconazole interacts with numerous other medications, potentially affecting their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  Inform your doctor of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal remedies) you are currently taking.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are typically required for individuals with kidney problems to prevent accumulation of the drug.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Fluconazole can cause liver damage; caution is advised in individuals with pre-existing liver conditions.  Liver function tests may be recommended.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Fluconazole is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its use during pregnancy requires careful evaluation of risks and benefits.  It is excreted in breast milk, and breastfeeding mothers should consult their doctors before using fluconazole.
* **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Fluconazole can cause electrolyte imbalances (like low potassium), particularly when used at high doses. Regular monitoring may be necessary.
* **Cardiac Effects:** There is a risk of QT interval prolongation, especially at higher doses. Patients with pre-existing heart conditions or taking medications that prolong the QT interval should be monitored carefully.

### FAQs

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking fluconazole?**  It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking fluconazole, as the combination could potentially increase the risk of side effects.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist.
* **How should I store fluconazole?** Store fluconazole at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
* **How long does it take for fluconazole to work?** The time it takes to notice improvement varies depending on the infection, but you should see improvement within a few days to weeks.
* **Can I stop taking fluconazole once I feel better?**  It's crucial to complete the full course of treatment prescribed by your healthcare provider, even if you start feeling better. Stopping early can lead to recurrence or resistance.
* **What if I experience a severe allergic reaction?** If you experience a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty breathing or swelling of the face, lips, or tongue), seek immediate medical attention.  This is a medical emergency.
