# Fluocinolone acetonide + Gentamicin

**Generic Name:** Fluocinolone acetonide + Gentamicin

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid (fluocinolone acetonide) and an aminoglycoside antibiotic (gentamicin) used to treat skin infections that are both inflamed and infected.  It's typically used for conditions like:

* **Infected eczema (dermatitis):**  Where inflammation and bacterial infection coexist.
* **Infected psoriasis:** Similar to eczema, but specifically for psoriasis plaques with secondary infection.
* **Impetigo:** A highly contagious bacterial skin infection.
* **Other infected inflammatory skin conditions:** As directed by a physician.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the area treated, duration of use, and individual sensitivity.  They can include:

* **Common:** Burning, stinging, itching at the application site, skin thinning, skin dryness, changes in skin pigmentation (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation).
* **Less Common:** Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles), acneiform eruptions (acne-like breakouts), striae (stretch marks), perioral dermatitis (rash around the mouth).
* **Rare but Serious:**  Allergic contact dermatitis (allergic reaction to the medication), systemic absorption (rare but can lead to effects similar to oral corticosteroids if used extensively or on large areas), secondary infection with fungi or viruses.  Prolonged use can suppress the immune system, making the skin more susceptible to infections.

**How it Works:**

* **Fluocinolone acetonide:** This corticosteroid reduces inflammation by suppressing the immune response in the skin. It decreases swelling, redness, itching, and other inflammatory symptoms.
* **Gentamicin:** This aminoglycoside antibiotic kills bacteria that are causing the infection.  It works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.

The combination allows for simultaneous treatment of both the infection and the inflammation, accelerating healing.


**FAQs:**

* **How long should I use this medication?**  Use only as directed by your doctor.  Generally, treatment shouldn't exceed 2-3 weeks. Longer use increases the risk of side effects.
* **Can I use this on my face?** Use only as prescribed by a doctor.  Facial skin is more sensitive and prone to side effects.
* **Can I use this on children?**  Use only as prescribed by a pediatrician.  Children may be more susceptible to side effects.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Apply the medication as soon as you remember, unless it is close to the time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.
* **Can I use this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Consult your doctor.  The use of this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding requires careful evaluation of risks and benefits.
* **Should I avoid sunlight?** While not explicitly contraindicated, protecting treated areas from excessive sun exposure is recommended as corticosteroids can increase sun sensitivity.
* **Can I use this with other medications?** Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, you are currently taking.  There may be interactions.
