# Fluocinolone acetonide + Gentamicin
### Generic Name
Fluocinolone acetonide + Gentamicin

### Usage

Fluocinolone acetonide and gentamicin combination is a topical medication primarily used to treat inflammatory skin conditions complicated by bacterial infection.  Fluocinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and itching. Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that combats bacterial infections.  This combination is effective against various bacterial strains commonly associated with skin infections, providing both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial actions.  The primary use is for conditions like infected eczema, infected dermatitis, and other inflammatory skin conditions with secondary bacterial infection.  It's important to note that this is not a first-line treatment for uncomplicated bacterial skin infections; a standalone antibiotic might be more appropriate in such cases.


### Dosage

Dosage is determined by the specific formulation (cream, ointment) and the affected area.  Generally, a thin layer of the cream or ointment is applied to the affected skin area twice daily, or as directed by a physician.  The duration of treatment varies depending on the severity and response to treatment, typically ranging from a few days to a couple of weeks.  **Never exceed the prescribed dosage or duration.**

* **Adults:**  Follow the physician's prescription carefully.  Typical application involves a thin layer to the affected area twice daily.
* **Children:** Use in children should be under strict medical supervision. Dosage will be determined by the physician considering the child's age, weight, and the extent of the condition.
* **Oral and IV Administration:** This medication is for topical use only and should **never** be taken orally or administered intravenously.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, or redness at the application site. Skin thinning (with prolonged use), acneiform eruptions.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), fungal or viral skin infections (superinfections), skin discoloration,  worsening of the underlying skin condition.  In rare cases, systemic absorption of gentamicin can occur leading to kidney problems, hearing loss, or other systemic side effects.


**If any adverse effects occur, stop using the medication and consult a healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Fluocinolone acetonide, a corticosteroid, works by reducing inflammation by suppressing the activity of inflammatory cells and mediators in the skin.  This reduces swelling, redness, itching, and pain associated with the inflammatory skin condition. Gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death and resolving the infection. The combined action of these two components effectively tackles both the inflammation and the infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This combination should not be used if you have a known allergy to fluocinolone acetonide, gentamicin, or any of its components.  It's also not suitable for treating viral or fungal skin infections.
* **Drug Interactions:** Inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, as some drugs might interact with fluocinolone acetonide or gentamicin.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should only occur under the strict supervision of a physician.  The benefits should outweigh the potential risks.
* **Children and Older Adults:**  Use in children and older adults requires careful monitoring due to potential increased sensitivity to side effects.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.  Do not use on large areas of skin or for prolonged periods without medical supervision.  Apply only to the affected area and wash hands thoroughly after application.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: Improvement is usually observed within a few days, but the full therapeutic effect might take longer, depending on the condition's severity.
* **Q: Can I use this medication on my face?** A:  Use on the face should be under strict medical supervision due to the risk of skin thinning.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the medication as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: Can I stop using this medication when I feel better?** A:  No, continue using it as directed by your physician even if you feel better, to prevent the recurrence of infection.  Stopping prematurely can lead to a relapse of the infection.
