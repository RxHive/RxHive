# Fluticasone Propionate

**Generic Name:** Fluticasone Propionate

**Usage:**

Fluticasone propionate is a corticosteroid used as an inhaled medication to prevent and control symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's also available as a nasal spray to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and nasal polyps.  The specific dosage and frequency depend on the condition being treated and the individual patient, and should always be prescribed by a doctor.  It is *not* a rescue inhaler for immediate relief of asthma symptoms.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects vary depending on the route of administration (inhaled or nasal). Common side effects include:

* **Inhaled:**  Hoarseness, throat irritation, thrush (oral candidiasis), headache, cough.  Rare but serious side effects include pneumonia, increased risk of getting infections, cataracts, glaucoma, osteoporosis (with long-term use).
* **Nasal:** Nosebleeds, headache, sore throat, nasal irritation, unpleasant taste.  Rarely, it can cause nasal septal perforation.

Serious side effects, though rare, can occur with both inhaled and nasal forms.  It's crucial to report any unusual symptoms to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

Fluticasone propionate is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation in the airways (for asthma and COPD) or nasal passages (for allergic rhinitis and nasal polyps).  It decreases the production of substances that cause inflammation and swelling, thus helping to improve airflow and reduce symptoms.  This is a preventative medication; it does not treat acute symptoms but reduces the likelihood of them occurring.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I use fluticasone propionate as a rescue inhaler?** No. It's a preventative medication, not a rescue medication. Use a short-acting beta-agonist inhaler (like albuterol) for immediate relief of asthma symptoms.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The full benefit of fluticasone propionate may not be seen for several days or weeks.  Consistent use is essential.
* **Can I stop taking fluticasone propionate suddenly?** No.  Stopping abruptly can worsen your condition.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.
* **What if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Are there any drug interactions?**  Yes, there can be interactions with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Is fluticasone propionate safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  The safety of fluticasone propionate during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a doctor.  The benefits and risks need to be carefully weighed.
