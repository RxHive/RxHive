# Felodipine

**Generic Name:** Felodipine

**Usage:**

Felodipine is a calcium channel blocker primarily used to treat:

* **Hypertension (high blood pressure):**  It helps relax blood vessels, lowering blood pressure.
* **Angina (chest pain):** By improving blood flow to the heart, it reduces the frequency and severity of angina attacks.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of felodipine include:

* **Headache:** A frequent side effect, often mild and temporary.
* **Flushing:**  Feeling of warmth or redness in the face, neck, and chest.
* **Dizziness:** Can be mild or more severe, potentially leading to falls.
* **Swelling in ankles, feet, or legs (edema):** Fluid retention is a common side effect.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty having bowel movements.
* **Palpitations:**  Awareness of your heartbeat.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** Can cause dizziness, fainting, and lightheadedness.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
* **Liver problems:**  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, and abdominal pain.
* **Gingival hyperplasia (gum enlargement):** Increased gum tissue growth.


**How it Works:**

Felodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.  It works by relaxing the muscles in the walls of your blood vessels.  This relaxation widens the blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily.  This reduced resistance lowers blood pressure and reduces the workload on the heart, thereby relieving angina symptoms.  It primarily affects the blood vessels, with less effect on the heart muscle itself compared to other calcium channel blockers.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking felodipine?**  Alcohol can increase the risk of low blood pressure and dizziness.  It's best to limit or avoid alcohol while taking felodipine.  Consult your doctor.
* **Can I take felodipine with other medications?**  Felodipine can interact with other medications, including some grapefruit juice. Always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
* **What are the long-term effects of felodipine?**  Long-term use generally carries the same risks as short-term use, though some side effects may become more pronounced over time.  Regular monitoring by your doctor is important.
* **Can I stop taking felodipine suddenly?**  No, you should never stop taking felodipine suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can cause a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Your doctor will advise on a gradual tapering schedule.
