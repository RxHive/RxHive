# Felodipine
### Generic Name
Felodipine

### Usage
Felodipine is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It's a calcium channel blocker that works by relaxing blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood.  This, in turn, lowers blood pressure.  While its primary use is for hypertension, felodipine may also be used off-label to treat chronic stable angina (chest pain).  However, for angina, beta-blockers are usually the preferred first-line treatment. Felodipine might be considered if a beta-blocker is not tolerated or is contraindicated.  It's crucial to remember that off-label uses should only be undertaken under the strict guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Hypertension (High Blood Pressure):**

* **Adults:** The usual starting dose is 2.5-5 mg once daily (OD) in the morning. The dose can be increased every 1-2 weeks, based on the patient's response, up to a maximum of 20 mg/day. Older adults usually start on a lower dose (2.5 mg OD) and should have their dose titrated more slowly.
* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of felodipine in children haven't been fully established.  Off-label use in children aged 6 years and older may begin with 2.5 mg OD, with dose increases at 2-week intervals as needed.  This should only be done under strict medical supervision.

**Chronic Stable Angina (Chest Pain):**

* **Adults:**  The usual starting dose is 5-10 mg OD. If the starting dose is 5mg, it may be increased to 10mg after 2-4 weeks if tolerated. Older adults typically start on a lower dose (2.5 mg OD) and require slower titration.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):**  Start with a lower dose (2.5 mg OD) and monitor blood pressure closely during dose adjustments.
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):**  Usually, no dosage adjustment is needed.


The medication is typically taken orally as a tablet.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions regarding dosage and administration.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* Flushing
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Dizziness
* Syncope (fainting)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)

Many other side effects are possible, though less frequent. If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Felodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.  Calcium plays a vital role in the contraction of muscles, including those in the walls of blood vessels.  Felodipine works by blocking the entry of calcium ions into these muscle cells. This relaxation of the blood vessel walls leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing blood pressure and improving blood flow to the heart.  In the case of angina, improved blood flow helps reduce chest pain.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Felodipine is contraindicated (should not be used) in people with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to felodipine, other dihydropyridines, or any component of the medication.
* **Interactions:** Felodipine can interact with many other medications, including other antihypertensives, antifungals, antibiotics, and others.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Felodipine is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are not fully known.  Other medications are typically preferred for treating hypertension in pregnancy.  The excretion of felodipine in breast milk is unknown; therefore, its use while breastfeeding is not recommended.
* **Specific Populations:** Older adults and those with liver disease may require dose adjustments.  Caution should be used in individuals with heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or those who are already experiencing low blood pressure.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking felodipine?** A: No. Grapefruit juice can interfere with the metabolism of felodipine, potentially leading to increased levels in the blood and a higher risk of side effects. Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while taking this medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not double the next dose to make up for a missed one.  Simply take the next scheduled dose as usual.

* **Q: How should I store felodipine?** A: Store felodipine at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I stop taking felodipine suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping felodipine abruptly can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Always consult your doctor before stopping or changing your medication.

* **Q:  What if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects may subside with continued use.  However, if you experience any serious or concerning side effects, contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.
