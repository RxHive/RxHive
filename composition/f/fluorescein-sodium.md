# Fluorescein Sodium
### Generic Name
Fluorescein Sodium

### Usage
Fluorescein sodium is a fluorescent dye primarily used as a diagnostic tool in ophthalmology. Its main application is in angiography or angioscopy of the retina and iris vasculature.  This involves injecting or applying the dye to visualize blood vessels in the eye, helping diagnose conditions like retinal vascular occlusions, diabetic retinopathy, and other retinal or iris vascular pathologies. While its primary use is ophthalmological, there are off-label uses under specific circumstances and with appropriate medical supervision.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Diagnostic Staining (Ophthalmic):**  A sufficient amount of 10% solution is instilled into the eye(s) until adequate staining is achieved. Alternatively, a 1mg strip can be moistened and applied to the conjunctiva or fornix.

* **Ophthalmic Angiography/Angioscopy (IV):** A single 500mg dose is injected into an antecubital vein.  For highly sensitive imaging systems, a 200mg dose may suffice.  An intradermal test dose of 0.05mL may be administered 30-60 minutes prior to the full dose to check for potential allergic reactions, although a negative test doesn't guarantee the absence of a reaction.

* **Oral (Off-label):**  While not the standard route, 1g of the injection solution has been used orally in some cases.  Image quality, however, is reported to be inferior to IV administration, especially during the early arterial phase.

**Pediatric Dosage (Ophthalmic Angiography, IV):**

* 7.7 mg/kg (actual body weight) as a single dose into an antecubital vein.
* Maximum dose: 500 mg.
* An intradermal test dose (0.05mL) is recommended before administration to assess for potential allergic reactions.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Yellow discoloration of the skin and urine (temporary)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Headache

Less common but serious side effects:

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Shock
* Bronchospasm
* Pulmonary edema
* Arterial ischemia
* Nerve palsy
* Rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Gastrointestinal distress

**Note:** If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Fluorescein sodium is a fluorescent dye. When exposed to specific wavelengths of light (between 465-490 nm), it emits fluorescence at longer wavelengths (520-530 nm).  This property allows healthcare professionals to visualize blood vessels in the eye during angiography or angioscopy.  The dye circulates within the bloodstream, illuminating the vessels and highlighting any blockages, abnormalities, or leaks.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fluorescein sodium is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to fluorescein or any components of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients with a history of allergies, asthma, or those prone to hypersensitivity reactions are at increased risk of adverse events.  Nausea, vomiting, skin, and urine discoloration are also potential side effects.
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiac disease.  Continuous ECG monitoring may be necessary in such cases.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Fluorescein sodium is categorized as pregnancy category C.  It's excreted in breast milk, so discarding breast milk for at least 4 days after injection is recommended.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the yellow discoloration of skin and urine last?** A: Skin discoloration typically lasts 6-12 hours after injection, while urine discoloration can persist for up to 36 hours.

* **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?** A: While not extensively documented, interactions with other medications are possible. Discuss any other medications you are taking with your doctor before undergoing fluorescein sodium administration.

* **Q: How is fluorescein sodium stored?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by the manufacturer on the product label.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a severe allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling, or significant drop in blood pressure warrant emergency care.

* **Q: Is fluorescein sodium safe for everyone?** A:  While generally safe when administered appropriately, there are contraindications and precautions.  Discuss your medical history with a healthcare professional to determine suitability.
