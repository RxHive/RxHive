# Fenbendazole
### Generic Name
Fenbendazole

### Usage
Fenbendazole is primarily used as an anthelmintic, meaning it's a medication to treat parasitic worm infestations in animals.  Its most common application is in veterinary medicine, targeting a wide range of internal parasites including roundworms (nematodes), hookworms, whipworms, and tapeworms in various species, such as dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and sheep. While not approved for human use by regulatory bodies like the FDA in most countries, fenbendazole has gained some attention for its off-label use in humans, primarily for the treatment of certain types of cancer, though this is highly controversial and requires careful consideration due to a lack of robust clinical trials and potential adverse effects.  Any use in humans should be strictly under the supervision and guidance of a qualified medical professional familiar with its potential risks and benefits.

### Dosage
**Dosage information below is for veterinary use only and should not be interpreted as guidance for human use.**  Human dosages, if ever considered, must be determined and overseen by a medical professional.  

* **Dogs and Cats:** Dosage varies significantly depending on the animal's weight, the type of parasite, and the specific product formulation. It's crucial to follow the instructions on the veterinary-approved product label precisely.  Typically administered orally as a suspension or tablet.
* **Horses:**  Dosage is weight-dependent and usually administered orally as a paste or suspension.
* **Cattle and Sheep:**  Dosage varies depending on the animal's weight and the type of parasite. It is often administered orally via drenching or through feed.
* **IV Administration:** Fenbendazole is not typically administered intravenously. Oral administration is standard practice in veterinary applications.

**Important Note:**  Never administer medications intended for animals to humans without explicit direction from a qualified physician.  Improper dosing can lead to serious health consequences.

### Side Effects
**In animals:**  The most common side effects are generally mild and include temporary gastrointestinal upset (vomiting, diarrhea), loss of appetite, and lethargy.  More serious side effects are rare but can include allergic reactions.

**In humans (off-label use):** Reports of side effects from the off-label use of fenbendazole in humans are limited and often anecdotal.  Potential side effects could mimic those seen in animals but might also include more serious consequences due to the lack of controlled studies on human dosages and long-term effects.  Always consult a physician immediately if adverse effects occur.


### How it Works
Fenbendazole works by interfering with the microtubule function of parasitic worms.  Microtubules are essential for various cellular processes, including nutrient transport and cell division.  By disrupting microtubule function, fenbendazole prevents the parasites from absorbing nutrients, ultimately leading to their death and expulsion from the body.  Its exact mechanism of action in cancer treatment, if any, is not fully understood and requires further research.


### Precautions
* **Veterinary Use Only (Unless otherwise directed by a physician):**  Fenbendazole is not approved for human consumption in most countries.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Use in pregnant or lactating animals should be under veterinary supervision.
* **Liver and Kidney Function:**  Animals with pre-existing liver or kidney disease require careful monitoring.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Potential interactions with other medications have not been fully studied. Always consult a veterinarian regarding any concurrent medications.
* **Overdose:**  Overdosing can lead to serious side effects.  Strictly adhere to the recommended dosage.

### FAQs

* **Q: Is fenbendazole safe for humans?**  A:  Fenbendazole is not approved for human use, and its safety and efficacy in humans for conditions beyond parasitic infections have not been established through rigorous clinical trials.  Use in humans should only be considered under strict medical supervision, if at all.

* **Q:  Where can I get fenbendazole?** A:  Fenbendazole is available as a veterinary medication from veterinarians or authorized suppliers.  It should not be purchased from unofficial sources.

* **Q: How should I store fenbendazole?** A:  Store according to the instructions on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from children and pets.

* **Q: What should I do if my pet shows adverse effects after taking fenbendazole?** A:  Contact your veterinarian immediately.
