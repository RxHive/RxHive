# Formoterol + Mometasone

**Generic Name:** Formoterol fumarate and Mometasone furoate

**Usage:**

Formoterol fumarate and mometasone furoate is a combination inhaler used to prevent and treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's a controller medication, meaning it's used regularly to help manage the underlying condition, not just to relieve symptoms during an attack.  Formoterol is a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) bronchodilator, which opens up the airways. Mometasone is an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), which reduces inflammation in the lungs.  The combination helps to control both the inflammation and bronchoconstriction associated with these respiratory conditions.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Hoarseness:**  A common side effect of inhaled corticosteroids.
* **Oral thrush (candidiasis):**  Fungal infection of the mouth and throat, more likely with higher doses and poor rinsing after use.
* **Headache:** Relatively common.
* **Throat irritation:** Can occur from the inhaler itself.
* **Nausea:** Less common.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Increased risk of pneumonia:**  Especially in patients with COPD.
* **Increased blood glucose levels:** Especially in patients with diabetes.
* **Osteoporosis:** Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids can increase the risk of bone thinning.
* **Cataracts and glaucoma:** Although rare, increased intraocular pressure has been reported.
* **Paradoxical bronchospasm:**  A worsening of breathing difficulties immediately after using the inhaler (rare but serious).
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:** Allergic reactions (rare).


**How it Works:**

* **Formoterol (LABA):**  Relaxes the muscles surrounding the airways, widening them and making it easier to breathe. The effect lasts for 12 hours or more.
* **Mometasone (ICS):** Reduces lung inflammation by suppressing the activity of inflammatory cells in the airways. This prevents the airways from becoming narrowed and inflamed. The effect is not immediate, requiring regular use for several days or weeks to achieve full benefit.

By combining both a bronchodilator and an anti-inflammatory medication, this combination inhaler provides a more comprehensive approach to managing asthma and COPD, reducing symptoms and preventing exacerbations.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I use this inhaler for quick relief during an asthma attack?** A: No, this is a controller medication, not a rescue inhaler.  You'll need a separate fast-acting bronchodilator (like albuterol) for quick relief.
* **Q: How often should I use this inhaler?** A: Your doctor will prescribe the correct dosage and frequency, but it's typically used once or twice daily.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop using this inhaler when my symptoms improve?** A: No, continue using it as prescribed, even if you feel better. Stopping abruptly can lead to a flare-up of your condition.
* **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?** A:  Yes, inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. Certain interactions are possible.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of using this inhaler?** A: Long-term use can be associated with some risks, such as osteoporosis and increased risk of pneumonia and other side effects mentioned above. Your doctor will monitor you for these risks.  Regular use can however significantly improve your quality of life and reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations.
