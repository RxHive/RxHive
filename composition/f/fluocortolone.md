# Fluocortolone
### Generic Name
Fluocortolone

### Usage
Fluocortolone is a corticosteroid medication primarily used for conditions requiring corticosteroid therapy and for corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses (skin conditions).  Its primary use is in treating inflammatory skin conditions.  Secondary uses may include managing certain systemic conditions such as bronchial asthma and hay fever, though this is less common and usually involves oral administration.  The topical form (cream or ointment) is specifically indicated for inflammatory skin problems where corticosteroids are beneficial.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the route of administration.

* **Systemic Conditions (e.g., bronchial asthma, hay fever, adrenocortical insufficiency):**  Oral administration. The dosage ranges widely, typically from 5 to 100 mg per day.  *This dosage should be determined and adjusted only by a physician, as it's highly dependent on the specific condition and individual patient response.*

* **Corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses (skin conditions):** Topical administration (cream or ointment containing 0.25% of the caproate, free alcohol, or pivalate ester). Apply a thin layer to the affected area once or twice daily. The specific formulation and frequency will be guided by a dermatologist.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and efficacy of fluocortolone in children have not been established.  Therefore, it is not typically recommended for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

No specific dosage adjustments are provided in manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in these populations.  Always consult a doctor before using fluocortolone if you have liver or kidney problems.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Topical Application):**

* Skin atrophy (thinning of the skin)
* Changes in skin pigmentation (discoloration)
* Burning sensation
* Stretch marks (striae)
* Telangiectasia (small dilated blood vessels)
* Hair growth (hirsutism)
* Allergic dermatitis (skin rash)
* Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles)
* Acne

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Systemic and Topical):**

* Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression (reduction in the body's natural cortisol production)
* Cushing's syndrome (a condition caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol)

*If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your doctor immediately.*


### How it Works

Fluocortolone is a glucocorticoid, a type of steroid hormone. It works by binding to specific receptors inside cells, influencing gene expression. This leads to a reduction in inflammation (swelling, redness, pain) by decreasing the activity of immune cells involved in the inflammatory process.  It also affects carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism but its primary therapeutic effect in the context discussed here is its anti-inflammatory action.

### Precautions

**Contraindications (should not be used):**

* Hypersensitivity to fluocortolone or other corticosteroids
* Skin infection caused by viruses (herpes simplex, vaccinia, varicella)
* Tuberculosis of the skin
* Untreated bacterial or fungal skin infections
* Acne, skin conditions around the mouth (perioral dermatitis), or rosacea
* Viral infections and syphilis
* Applying to large surface areas or denuded (raw) skin with occlusive dressings.
* Systemic infection.
* Widespread plaque psoriasis
* Infants under 1 year old


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Use with caution in patients with a history of tuberculosis, congestive heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, hepatic or renal impairment, osteoporosis, peptic ulcers, or severe affective disorders.
* Use with caution in elderly patients and patients with a history of steroid myopathy.
* Long-term use may suppress the HPA axis and lead to growth retardation in children.
* Topical application to the face should be avoided unless absolutely necessary; avoid contact with the eyes.
*  Increased risk of secondary ocular infections with prolonged topical use.  There is a possibility of increased risk of developing Kaposi's sarcoma.
*  Inform your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant.
* Do not use occlusive dressings with topical fluocortolone.
* Avoid the use of cosmetics or other skincare products on treated areas.



### FAQs

* **Q: How long should I use fluocortolone?**  A: The duration of treatment depends on the condition and response to treatment. Your doctor will determine the appropriate length of use.  Do not exceed the prescribed time.

* **Q: Can I stop using fluocortolone suddenly?** A:  No, especially if you are using it systemically for a significant time.  Abrupt discontinuation may lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Your doctor must supervise the tapering-off process.

* **Q: Can I use fluocortolone with other medications?** A: Some medications can interact with fluocortolone. Tell your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Q: How should I store fluocortolone?** A: Store fluocortolone as directed on the label. Typically, this involves storing it at room temperature away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Is fluocortolone safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A: Fluocortolone is categorized as a pregnancy Category C drug, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  The use in pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision after careful risk assessment.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
