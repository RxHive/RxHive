# Fluticasone Furoate + Vilanterol
### Generic Name
Fluticasone Furoate + Vilanterol

### Usage

Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol is a combination inhaler used to prevent and treat symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and asthma.  It's not for treating sudden breathing problems.

**Primary Use:**  Preventing and relieving symptoms of COPD and asthma, such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.  It helps improve lung function and reduces the frequency of exacerbations (worsening of symptoms).

**Secondary Use:**  In some cases, it might be used to treat other conditions affecting the airways, but this should always be under the direction of a physician.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the individual's condition, age, and response to treatment.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose and regimen.  The medication is typically administered via inhalation using a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or a dry powder inhaler (DPI).  **Never adjust the dosage without consulting your doctor.**

**Adults (COPD and Asthma):**  The usual starting dose is one inhalation twice daily.  The doctor may adjust this based on your response.

**Children:** This combination inhaler is generally not prescribed for children under the age of 12.  If a child needs treatment for asthma or COPD, alternative medications are usually considered.

**Oral and IV Administration:** Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol is not available in oral or intravenous forms. It's exclusively for inhalation.

**Specific Instructions:**  Proper inhaler technique is crucial for effective delivery.  Follow your doctor's instructions and the inhaler's package insert carefully.  If unsure about technique, seek clarification from your doctor or pharmacist.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Headache, throat irritation, hoarseness, thrush (oral yeast infection), upper respiratory tract infection.
* **Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  Increased risk of pneumonia, paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties), osteoporosis (weakening of bones), glaucoma, cataracts, bruising, and increased blood sugar.  
* **Allergic Reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions such as rash, hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, and difficulty breathing can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction is suspected.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Fluticasone furoate is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the airways.  Inflammation is a key factor in asthma and COPD, leading to airway narrowing and difficulty breathing.  By reducing inflammation, fluticasone furoate helps to open the airways, making breathing easier.

Vilanterol is a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA).  It relaxes the muscles in the airways, further widening them and improving airflow.  The combination of these two medications provides a synergistic effect, offering both anti-inflammatory and bronchodilating actions for more effective symptom control.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to either fluticasone furoate, vilanterol, or any components of the inhaler.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbs, and supplements you are taking.  Some medications may interact with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  The benefits and risks should be carefully weighed.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may be more susceptible to some side effects, such as osteoporosis.  Regular monitoring may be necessary.
* **Patients with Liver or Kidney Disease:**  Caution is advised in patients with significant liver or kidney impairment.  Dosage adjustments may be needed.

**Important Note:**  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely and inform them of any pre-existing medical conditions or allergies.


### FAQs
