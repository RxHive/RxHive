# Fluticasone Furoate + Vilanterol

**Generic Name:** Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol

**Usage:**

Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol is a combination inhaler used to prevent and treat airflow blockage in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and asthma.  It's not for the quick relief of asthma symptoms; a separate rescue inhaler (like albuterol) is needed for that purpose.  It's used daily, as prescribed by a doctor.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Headache:**  This is a relatively frequent side effect.
* **Throat irritation:**  This can be caused by the inhaler itself.
* **Hoarseness:** Similar to throat irritation.
* **Cough:**  Sometimes a cough can be worsened, or a new cough can develop.
* **Yeast infections (thrush) in the mouth and throat:** Rinsing the mouth after using the inhaler can help prevent this.
* **Muscle aches:** Less common.


Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **Increased risk of pneumonia:**  This is a concern, especially in older adults.
* **Increased risk of bone fractures (osteoporosis):**  Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids like fluticasone furoate can increase this risk.
* **Paradoxically increased bronchospasm:**  In rare cases, the inhaler can worsen breathing problems.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions ranging from mild skin rash to severe anaphylaxis can occur.
* **High blood sugar (hyperglycemia):**  More likely in individuals with diabetes or risk factors for diabetes.
* **Glaucoma and cataracts:**  Long-term use can increase the risk.
* **Changes in mood and behavior:**  This includes anxiety, depression, and insomnia.

**How it Works:**

Fluticasone furoate is a corticosteroid.  It works by reducing inflammation in the airways, helping to prevent airway narrowing and making breathing easier. Vilanterol is a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA). It relaxes the muscles around the airways, also helping to improve airflow.  The combination of the two medications provides both anti-inflammatory and bronchodilating effects.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I use this inhaler for immediate relief of breathing problems?** A: No, this is a maintenance inhaler for long-term control.  You will need a separate quick-relief inhaler (such as albuterol) for acute symptoms.

* **Q: How often should I use this inhaler?** A:  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully. Typically, it's used once or twice daily.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I use this inhaler if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: Talk to your doctor.  The benefits and risks need to be carefully considered.

* **Q: Can I use this inhaler with other medications?** A:  Tell your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbs, and supplements.  Some interactions are possible.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor if you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above as serious side effects.
