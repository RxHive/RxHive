# Factor IX Fc Fusion Protein Recombinant
### Generic Name
Factor IX Fc Fusion Protein Recombinant

### Usage
Factor IX Fc fusion protein (recombinant) is a medication used to treat Hemophilia B in adults and children.  Hemophilia B is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in clotting factor IX. This medicine is used in several ways:

* **On-demand treatment:** To control and stop bleeding episodes as they occur.
* **Perioperative management:** To manage bleeding during and after surgical procedures.
* **Routine prophylaxis:** To prevent bleeding episodes from happening in the first place, reducing their frequency significantly.


It's crucial to understand that this medication only replaces factor IX. It is *not* suitable for treating deficiencies in other clotting factors, hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors, reversing anticoagulation from medications like vitamin K antagonists, or bleeding caused by low levels of liver-dependent clotting factors.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Dosage calculations for Factor IX Fc fusion protein (recombinant) are complex and individualized. The information below provides a general overview.  **Always follow the specific instructions provided by your healthcare provider and the medication's prescribing information.** Dosage depends on several factors including:

* **Body weight:** Dosage is often calculated per kilogram of body weight.
* **Severity of the condition:**  The amount needed depends on the level of factor IX deficiency.
* **Bleeding location and severity:**  More severe or difficult-to-control bleeds require higher doses.
* **In vivo recovery (IVR):** This is a measure of how much factor IX levels increase after a dose is given; it varies between individuals and products.
* **Desired factor IX peak level and duration:**  These are determined based on clinical guidelines.

**Adult Dosage (On-demand & Perioperative):**  Dosage is calculated using a formula that considers IVR, desired peak factor IX level, baseline factor IX level, and body weight.  The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) provides recommendations for desired peak levels depending on the location and severity of bleeding (see details in the provided text).  The frequency of administration is also individualized, depending on clinical response and factor IX activity measurements.  Generally, repeat doses may be needed every 6-10 hours to every 48 hours, depending on the situation.


**Adult Dosage (Prophylaxis):**  Typical prophylactic doses range from 50 units/kg once every 7 days to 100 units/kg once every 10 days. The goal is to maintain trough factor IX levels of at least 1%, and preferably 3-5%, between doses. This dosage is adjusted based on individual response and bleeding episodes.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Dosage is also individualized based on factors mentioned above.  The formula for calculating the required units is similar to the adult formula, but the specific values and approach will be determined by the treating physician.  Prophylaxis in children might require more frequent or higher doses than in adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturerâ€™s labeling for hepatic or renal impairment; however, close monitoring of factor IX levels is essential.  For patients with obesity, individualized dosage adjustments based on response are necessary, and consultation with institutional protocols may be valuable.

**Administration:** Factor IX Fc fusion protein (recombinant) is administered intravenously (IV) via bolus infusion.  The maximum infusion rate is usually 10 mL/min but can vary based on age and other factors.  Always follow the manufacturer's instructions.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Oral paresthesia (numbness or tingling in the mouth)
* Obstructive uropathy (blockage of the urinary tract)
* Factor IX inhibitor development (in Hemophilia B patients)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Erythema (redness) at the injection site


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Palpitations
* Decreased appetite
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Halitosis (bad breath)
* Hematuria (blood in the urine)
* Infusion-site pain
* Renal colic (kidney pain)
* Thromboembolic complications (blood clots)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Antibody development (neutralizing antibodies)

**If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Factor IX Fc fusion protein (recombinant) works by replacing the missing or deficient clotting factor IX in individuals with Hemophilia B.  This medication is a recombinant protein, meaning it's produced through genetic engineering.  Factor IX is a crucial part of the blood clotting cascade.  When this factor is deficient, it leads to prolonged bleeding.  By supplementing the missing factor, this medication helps restore normal blood clotting.

### Precautions

* **Contraindicated:** in patients with hypersensitivity to Factor IX Fc fusion protein (recombinant) or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX, thromboembolic complications (blood clots), and nephrotic syndrome (kidney disorder).
* **Use with Caution:** In patients with liver disease, post-operatively, neonates, those at risk of thromboembolic events or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and those with signs of fibrinolysis.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  This medication is categorized as pregnancy category C.  The risks to the mother and fetus are unknown.  Whether it's excreted in breast milk is also unknown.  Benefits and risks of breastfeeding should be carefully weighed.
* **Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is this medication administered?**  A: It's administered intravenously (IV) by bolus infusion.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies, depending on the dose and individual response.
* **Q: How is it stored?** A: Storage instructions should be followed carefully as indicated on the product label. Generally, refrigeration is required.
