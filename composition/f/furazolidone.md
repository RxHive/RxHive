# Furazolidone

**Generic Name:** Furazolidone

**Usage:** Furazolidone is an antibiotic used to treat certain types of bacterial diarrhea, specifically those caused by *Escherichia coli*, *Shigella*, and *Salmonella* species. It's also sometimes used to treat giardiasis (an infection caused by *Giardia lamblia* protozoa) and other intestinal infections.  **Important Note:**  Furazolidone is rarely used now due to the availability of safer and more effective alternatives and potential for serious side effects.  Its use should be guided by a physician and only when other antibiotics are unsuitable.

**Side Effects:**  Furazolidone can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others severe. These include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (paradoxical), abdominal cramps, loss of appetite.
* **Neurological:** Headache, dizziness, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage, potentially permanent), seizures (rare).
* **Hematologic:**  Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells), especially in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives, angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction).
* **Other:**  Disulfiram-like reaction (severe reaction when consumed with alcohol), discoloration of urine (brownish-orange),  drug interactions (see FAQs).


**How it Works:** Furazolidone is a nitrofuran antibiotic. It works by interfering with the bacterial production of proteins and nucleic acids, essential for bacterial growth and survival.  It achieves this by inhibiting bacterial enzymes involved in energy production and DNA synthesis.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Furazolidone safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**  No, it should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to the potential for harmful effects on the developing fetus and infant.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Furazolidone?** No.  Furazolidone can cause a serious reaction similar to disulfiram (Antabuse), a medication used to deter alcohol consumption. Combining the two can lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, flushing, and rapid heartbeat.
* **What are the drug interactions?**  Furazolidone interacts with many drugs, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), anticoagulants (blood thinners), and alcohol (as mentioned above).  It is crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The duration of treatment varies depending on the infection but typically lasts several days to a couple of weeks. Improvement may be seen within a few days.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any significant or concerning side effects.
* **Is Furazolidone a first-line treatment for diarrhea?** No, it is generally not considered a first-line treatment.  Other, safer and more effective antibiotics are usually preferred.  Its use is reserved for specific situations where other antibiotics are ineffective or contraindicated.
