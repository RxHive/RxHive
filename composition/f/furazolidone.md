# Furazolidone
### Generic Name
Furazolidone

### Usage

Furazolidone is an antimicrobial medication primarily used to treat diarrhea and enteritis (inflammation of the intestines) caused by susceptible bacteria and protozoa.  Its main applications are in treating infections caused by *Giardia lamblia* (giardiasis) and *Vibrio cholerae* (cholera). It can also be effective against certain types of bacterial diarrhea, but its use has decreased due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance and the availability of other, more effective treatments.  The decision to use furazolidone should always be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, considering the specific infection and potential alternatives.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For giardiasis, cholera, or bacterial diarrhea, the typical adult dose is 100 mg taken four times a day (QID). Treatment usually lasts 4-7 days, but for giardiasis, it may be extended to a maximum of 10 days under a doctor's supervision.

**Children (over 1 month old):** The usual dose is 1.25 mg per kilogram of body weight, four times a day. Treatment duration is typically 2-5 days, potentially extending to 10 days for giardiasis under medical guidance.  It's crucial to accurately calculate the dose based on the child's weight and always follow a healthcare professional's instructions.

**Dosage Forms:** Furazolidone is typically available as oral tablets or liquid suspension.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist regarding the correct dosage form and administration method.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  It is crucial to discuss any existing liver or kidney conditions with your doctor before starting treatment.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, malaise (general discomfort)
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), orthostatic hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing), rashes, fever, arthralgia (joint pain), brown urine discoloration, hemolytic anemia (breakdown of red blood cells), agranulocytosis (severe reduction of white blood cells).  A hypertensive crisis can occur if furazolidone is taken with MAO inhibitors (certain antidepressants).

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Furazolidone is a nitrofuran antibiotic. Its mechanism of action involves interfering with the bacterial enzyme systems and causing cross-linking of DNA within bacterial cells. This disrupts their normal function and ultimately leads to their death, helping to resolve the infection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Furazolidone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to furazolidone and infants under 1 month of age.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, as it may trigger hemolytic anemia.
* **Drug Interactions:** Furazolidone can interact with several medications, including MAO inhibitors, sympathomimetics (like some decongestants), levodopa (used for Parkinson's disease), and amitriptyline (an antidepressant).  These combinations can potentially lead to severe complications such as hypertensive crises or toxic psychosis.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Furazolidone is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using it during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store furazolidone?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking furazolidone?** A: No. Avoid alcohol consumption for at least four days after completing the course of furazolidone.
* **Q: Can I drive while taking furazolidone?** A: Dizziness is a possible side effect.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if you experience dizziness.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q:  How long does it take to work?** A:  The effectiveness of the medication varies depending on the infection's severity.  Improvement is usually seen within a few days, but it's vital to complete the full course of treatment as prescribed.
* **Q:  Is it safe to use furazolidone long-term?** A:  Furazolidone is generally not intended for long-term use. Its use should be limited to the duration recommended by your healthcare provider.
