# Framycetin

**Generic Name:** Framycetin

**Usage:** Framycetin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used topically (on the skin) to treat bacterial skin infections.  It's often found in creams, ointments, and powders.  Specific uses might include treating infected wounds, burns, and skin ulcers.  It's *not* for internal use.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild when applied topically, but can include:

* **Local reactions:** Irritation, redness, itching, burning, rash, swelling at the application site.
* **Allergic reactions:** In rare cases, more serious allergic reactions such as hives, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat can occur.  Stop use and seek immediate medical attention if this happens.
* **Sensitivity:**  Prolonged use or application to large areas of skin can increase the risk of side effects.

**How it Works:** Framycetin works by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacteria.  This disrupts the bacteria's ability to grow and multiply, ultimately leading to their death.  It's effective against a range of Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.
