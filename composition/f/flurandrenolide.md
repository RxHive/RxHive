# Flurandrenolide
### Generic Name
Flurandrenolide

### Usage
Flurandrenolide, also known as fludroxycortide, is a topical corticosteroid primarily used to relieve the inflammation and itching (pruritus) associated with various skin conditions that respond to corticosteroids.  These conditions include a range of inflammatory and pruritic dermatoses (skin diseases).  While it's not a first-line treatment for all skin issues, it's effective for many steroid-responsive dermatoses.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  Dosage depends on the specific formulation (cream, lotion, ointment, tape) and the severity of the condition.

* **Cream/Lotion/Ointment:** A thin film should be applied to the affected area 2-3 times daily.
* **Tape:** Apply 1-2 times per day.

Treatment should be stopped once the condition is under control. If no improvement is seen after two weeks, a reevaluation of the diagnosis may be necessary.

**Children:** Dosage is determined by the severity of the condition and the child's response, always using the smallest amount for the shortest duration to minimize the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression.  The same application methods (cream/ointment/tape) and frequency as adults apply, but the quantity used should be minimized.


**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Thinning of the skin, changes in skin color, acne-like eruptions, burning, itching, dryness, miliaria (heat rash), stretch marks (striae), visible blood vessels (telangiectasia), excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis), perioral dermatitis (rash around the mouth), allergic contact dermatitis, and folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles).
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Adrenal suppression (leading to hypercortisolism or HPA axis suppression).  Skin discoloration, skin striae, skin atrophy, and contact dermatitis have been reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports.


**Note:** If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Flurandrenolide is a topical corticosteroid with intermediate potency.  It works by reducing inflammation, relieving itching, and causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels).  The exact anti-inflammatory mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to involve stabilizing cell membranes and lysosomes, preventing the release of enzymes that contribute to inflammation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Flurandrenolide is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.  Flurandrenolide tape should not be used on weeping or oozing lesions or in skin folds (intertriginous areas).
* **Increased Risk:**  Prolonged or extensive use can increase the risk of adrenal suppression, Kaposi's sarcoma, systemic effects (affecting the whole body), contact dermatitis, and skin infections.
* **Use with Caution:** Use with caution under occlusive dressings, on raw skin, or over large areas of the body.  Caution is also advised in individuals with Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, or glycosuria (sugar in the urine), and in children.  Avoid applying to the nipples during breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use Flurandrenolide on my face?** A:  While it can be used on the face, it's generally not recommended for routine use in this area, underarms, or groin due to increased risk of absorption and potential side effects. Consult your doctor.

* **Q: How should I store Flurandrenolide?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I use other skincare products with Flurandrenolide?** A: It's generally best to avoid using cosmetics or other skincare products on treated areas unless directed otherwise by your doctor.  If using a moisturizer, apply it first, then wait 10-15 minutes before applying Flurandrenolide.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  Improvement should be seen within two weeks. If not, consult your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the medication as soon as you remember; if it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed one. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is Flurandrenolide safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** A:  It's categorized as pregnancy Category C, meaning the risk to the fetus isn't fully established.  Topical use should be limited in pregnancy and use during breastfeeding requires caution, as excretion in breast milk is unknown.  Avoid applying to the nipples if breastfeeding.
