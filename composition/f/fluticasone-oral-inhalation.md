# Fluticasone (Oral Inhalation)
### Generic Name
Fluticasone (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage

Fluticasone oral inhalation is a corticosteroid medication primarily used for the long-term, preventative treatment of asthma.  It's crucial to understand that fluticasone is not a rescue medication for sudden asthma attacks (acute bronchospasm). Instead, it works to reduce airway inflammation, making it easier to breathe and preventing asthma exacerbations.  Its primary use is in the maintenance therapy of asthma in adults and children, often used in combination with other asthma medications like bronchodilators.

While not its primary indication, fluticasone has some off-label uses. These include the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus), where it's administered orally (swallowed, not inhaled), and in the management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), typically as part of a combination therapy regimen.  These off-label uses should only be considered under the guidance of a physician.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation (dry powder inhaler, metered-dose inhaler, nebulizer), the age and weight of the patient, and the severity of the condition being treated.  Precise dosage instructions must always come from a healthcare provider, who will tailor the regimen based on individual needs.  Here's a general overview:

**Adults:**

* **Asthma:**  Dosage ranges widely, from low doses (e.g., 100 mcg daily) to high doses (e.g., 1000 mcg daily), administered in divided doses depending on the inhaler type and severity of the asthma.  This is often tailored according to current guidelines such as those from the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA).  The physician will adjust the dosage over time based on response.
* **Eosinophilic Esophagitis (Off-label):**  Typically begins with a higher dose (e.g., 880 mcg daily) delivered as an aerosolized spray that is then swallowed.  The dosage is then gradually lowered once the condition is under control.
* **COPD (Off-label):**  Generally used at lower doses (e.g., 50-500 mcg daily) as part of a combination inhaler therapy.

**Children:**

Pediatric dosing is much more complex and greatly depends on age, weight, and the specific formulation.  Again, the dose is usually titrated upward or downward based on the child's response to therapy and the severity of their condition.  Dosages are always determined and adjusted by a pediatrician.  In general, younger children start at lower doses.

**Administration:**

Always follow the instructions for your specific inhaler device. It is generally recommended to rinse the mouth with water after inhalation to help prevent oral thrush (candidiasis).

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Fatigue
* Malaise (general feeling of discomfort)
* Headache
* Upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., sinusitis, common cold)
* Throat irritation
* Oral candidiasis (thrush)
* Musculoskeletal pain and/or arthralgia (joint pain)

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Increased risk of pneumonia
* Adrenal suppression
* Osteoporosis (reduced bone density)
* Cataracts
* Glaucoma
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above as potentially serious, consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Fluticasone is an inhaled corticosteroid.  It works by reducing inflammation in the airways.  Inflammation is a key feature of asthma and COPD. By decreasing inflammation, fluticasone helps to open the airways, making it easier to breathe and preventing further airway narrowing.  It achieves this by affecting various immune cells and inflammatory molecules involved in the inflammatory response.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fluticasone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fluticasone or any component of the formulation, severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins or lactose, untreated respiratory infections (fungal, bacterial, or tubercular), and those needing immediate treatment for severe asthma exacerbations.
* **Drug Interactions:** Fluticasone can interact with numerous medications, particularly those that affect liver metabolism (CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers). Consult a doctor or pharmacist about any other medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Fluticasone is a Category C medication during pregnancy.  While generally considered safe to use, the decision should be made in consultation with a physician.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, but the benefits of breastfeeding often outweigh the potential risks.
* **Other Precautions:** Use caution in patients with a history of osteoporosis, glaucoma, cataracts, hepatic impairment, or those switching from systemic corticosteroids.  Children should be monitored for growth.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use fluticasone for immediate relief of asthma symptoms?**
    * **A:** No, fluticasone is a preventative medication, not a rescue inhaler. Use a quick-relief bronchodilator for immediate symptom relief.

* **Q: How should I store fluticasone?**
    * **A:** Store according to the instructions on the package, generally at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
    * **A:** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Can fluticasone cause weight gain?**
    * **A:**  Weight gain is a possibility, particularly with higher doses and long-term use. This is more likely with swallowed fluticasone than inhaled. Consult your doctor if you have concerns.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking fluticasone suddenly?**
    * **A:** It's usually not recommended to abruptly stop fluticasone.  Sudden cessation could lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Your doctor will advise on a gradual tapering-off schedule if needed.
