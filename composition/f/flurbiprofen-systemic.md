# Flurbiprofen (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Flurbiprofen (Systemic)

### Usage
Flurbiprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve the signs and symptoms of several conditions:

*   **Rheumatoid arthritis:** A chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints. Flurbiprofen helps reduce pain, swelling, and stiffness.
*   **Osteoarthritis:**  A degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage breakdown.  Flurbiprofen helps manage pain and inflammation.
*   **Ankylosing spondylitis:** A form of inflammatory arthritis primarily affecting the spine.  Flurbiprofen helps alleviate pain and stiffness.
*   **Dysmenorrhea:** Painful menstruation. Flurbiprofen provides pain relief.
*   **Mild to moderate pain with inflammation:** This includes conditions like bursitis (inflammation of the bursae), tendinopathy (inflammation of tendons), and soft tissue trauma. Flurbiprofen reduces both pain and inflammation in these cases.
*   **Sore throat:** Flurbiprofen lozenges are used to provide symptomatic relief from sore throat pain.

### How it Works

Flurbiprofen belongs to the NSAID class of drugs. It works by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2. These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are substances that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, flurbiprofen helps alleviate these symptoms.  While the primary mechanism is COX inhibition, other effects on the immune system may also contribute to its anti-inflammatory action.

### Precautions

*   **Allergy:** Do not take flurbiprofen if you are allergic to it, aspirin, or other NSAIDs.  A history of asthma, hives, or allergic reactions to these medications is a contraindication.
*   **Heart and Blood Vessel Problems:** Flurbiprofen increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. This risk is higher with prolonged use and in individuals with existing cardiovascular disease.
*   **Gastrointestinal Problems:** Flurbiprofen can cause stomach ulcers, bleeding, and perforation.  This risk is increased in individuals with a history of ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding.
*   **Kidney and Liver Problems:** Flurbiprofen can affect kidney and liver function.  Use caution in individuals with impaired kidney or liver function and consult your doctor.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Flurbiprofen is generally not recommended during the third trimester of pregnancy and should be avoided during breastfeeding.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Flurbiprofen can interact with many other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking.
*   **Elderly Patients:** Older adults are more susceptible to side effects from NSAIDs, including gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney problems.
*   **Other Precautions:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking flurbiprofen, as this can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Use caution when operating machinery or driving, as drowsiness is a possible side effect.
