# Fluorouracil (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Fluorouracil (Systemic)

### Usage

Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a chemotherapy drug, specifically an antimetabolite, used to treat various types of cancer.  Its primary use is in the treatment of several solid tumors, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer (colon and rectal cancers), stomach (gastric) cancer, and pancreatic cancer.  It's often used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs as part of a regimen tailored to the specific cancer type and stage.  

Beyond its primary applications, fluorouracil has off-label uses in treating other cancers like anal carcinoma, bladder cancer, esophageal cancer, cervical cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, hepatobiliary cancers, neuroendocrine tumors (pancreatic), penile cancer, vulvar cancer, and cancers of unknown primary origin.  It also has a very specific off-label use as an adjunctive therapy in glaucoma surgery.  The off-label uses often involve combining fluorouracil with radiation therapy or other chemotherapeutic agents.  It's crucial to remember that off-label use should only be undertaken under the strict guidance and supervision of an oncologist.

### Dosage

Fluorouracil dosage is highly variable and depends heavily on several factors, including the specific cancer being treated, the patient's body surface area (BSA), overall health, other medications being taken, and the chosen treatment regimen (combination therapy).  Dosage is typically calculated in mg/m² (milligrams per square meter of body surface area).  The following examples are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent a complete list of all possible regimens.  **Always follow the specific prescription and instructions provided by your doctor or oncologist.**

* **Breast Cancer:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific regimen used (e.g., CMF, CAF, FEC).  Typical intravenous (IV) doses range from 500-600 mg/m² administered on specific days within a 21- or 28-day cycle, repeated for several cycles.

* **Colorectal Cancer:**  Various regimens exist, often involving a bolus injection followed by a continuous infusion over several hours or days.  Typical doses might involve a 400 mg/m² bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 2400-3000 mg/m² over 46 hours, repeated every 2 weeks.  Regimens frequently incorporate leucovorin and other drugs like oxaliplatin or irinotecan.

* **Gastric Cancer:** Dosages and regimens vary widely depending on the treatment plan (e.g., ECF, FLOT, TCF).  Treatments may involve continuous IV infusions of 200-1000 mg/m²/day for varying durations.

* **Pancreatic Cancer:**  Again, regimens vary (e.g., FOLFIRINOX, modified FOLFIRINOX).  Treatments might include a 400 mg/m² bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 2400 mg/m² over 46 hours every 2 weeks, often combined with other medications.  For adjuvant therapy (after surgery), different schedules and dosages are used.

* **Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of fluorouracil in pediatric patients haven't been established.

**Administration:**  Fluorouracil is typically administered intravenously (IV), either as a bolus injection, a rapid IV push, or a continuous infusion.  Specific instructions for administration will be provided by your healthcare team.  For its ophthalmic application (off-label use in glaucoma surgery), it's applied topically as a soaked sponge or via subconjunctival injection.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are often necessary based on the patient's response to treatment, the development of side effects, or the presence of underlying health conditions such as hepatic or renal impairment.  These adjustments should always be made under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Side Effects

Fluorouracil can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially more serious.  These side effects can vary in severity and not everyone experiences them.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea and vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Mouth sores (mucositis)
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia)
* Fatigue

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Bone marrow suppression (leading to low blood cell counts)
* Cardiotoxicity (heart problems)
* Neurotoxicity (nerve damage)
* Severe skin reactions
* Severe gastrointestinal issues

**If you experience any concerning side effects, particularly those listed above as less common but serious, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Fluorouracil is a pyrimidine analog that interferes with the production of DNA and RNA, essential building blocks of cells.  It works by mimicking uracil, a natural component of these molecules.  Once inside cancer cells, fluorouracil is converted to active metabolites. One metabolite, F-UMP, is incorporated into RNA, disrupting its function. Another metabolite, F-dUMP, inhibits an enzyme called thymidylate synthase, preventing the creation of thymidine, a crucial building block of DNA. This combined action leads to impaired DNA and RNA synthesis, ultimately causing cancer cells to die.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Fluorouracil is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to it or its components.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Use caution in patients with liver or kidney disease; dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Bone Marrow Suppression:**  Fluorouracil can suppress bone marrow function, potentially leading to low blood counts.  Regular blood tests are crucial to monitor this.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Fluorouracil is a Category D drug during pregnancy (potential for fetal harm).  Effective contraception is essential.  Its safety during breastfeeding is unknown.
* **Drug Interactions:** Fluorouracil can interact with other drugs, including warfarin (blood thinner) and allopurinol (gout medication).  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Other Precautions:**  Patients should maintain good nutrition and hydration during treatment.  Avoid excessive sun exposure due to increased photosensitivity.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I be on fluorouracil?** A: The duration of treatment depends on many factors, including your specific cancer type, stage, and response to treatment. Your oncologist will determine the treatment plan.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Never adjust your dosage or treatment schedule without consulting your oncologist.  Contact them for guidance if you miss a dose.

* **Q: How should I store fluorouracil?** A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided with your medication. Generally, it needs to be kept refrigerated.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A: Some long-term side effects are possible, although the risk depends on many things, including the duration and type of treatment.  Your oncologist can discuss potential long-term risks.

* **Q: Is fluorouracil safe?** A: Like all chemotherapy drugs, fluorouracil carries risks of side effects, some severe.  However, when administered and monitored properly by a qualified healthcare professional, the benefits often outweigh the risks for appropriate cancer treatments.
