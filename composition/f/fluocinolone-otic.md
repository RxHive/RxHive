# Fluocinolone (Otic)
### Generic Name
Fluocinolone (Otic)

### Usage
Fluocinolone otic is a corticosteroid medication primarily used to treat chronic eczematous external otitis, a type of inflammation affecting the outer ear canal.  It's effective in reducing inflammation, itching, and discomfort associated with this condition.

### Dosage

**Adults and Children â‰¥2 years:**

* **Chronic eczematous external otitis:**  The typical dosage is 5 drops of 0.01% fluocinolone otic solution (oil-based) into the affected ear twice daily (BID) for one to two weeks.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance in such cases.

**Administration:** To apply, tilt the head to the side, pull the earlobe upward and backward, and instill the drops into the ear canal. Keep the head tilted for about a minute to allow the medication to reach the affected area. Gently blot any excess medication with a clean cotton ball.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Burning, dryness, erythema (redness), itching, irritation.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic contact dermatitis, acneiform eruptions (acne-like rash), folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles), skin atrophy (thinning of the skin), striae (stretch marks), hypopigmentation (loss of skin color), miliaria (heat rash), keratosis pilaris (small, rough bumps on the skin), ear infection.

**Important Note:** If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Fluocinolone is a corticosteroid with low-to-medium potency. It works by reducing inflammation in the ear canal.  It achieves this by suppressing the production and activity of various inflammatory substances in the body, such as kinins, histamine, and prostaglandins. This leads to a decrease in swelling, redness, itching, and pain.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fluocinolone otic is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to fluocinolone or any components of the formulation.
* **Warnings:**  Prolonged or excessive use can increase the risk of hypercortisolism (excess cortisol in the body) and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which regulates hormone production.  There's also an increased risk of allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infections (bacterial or fungal), and systemic effects if used improperly.  Use with caution in individuals with a peanut allergy (as some formulations may contain peanut oil).
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Fluocinolone otic is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Large amounts or prolonged use should be avoided during pregnancy.  Excretion into breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Other Medications:** No significant interactions are currently known. However, always inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
