# Fosamprenavir
### Generic Name
Fosamprenavir

### Usage
Fosamprenavir is an HIV protease inhibitor.  It's used in combination with other antiretroviral medications to treat HIV-1 infection.  It is *not* recommended as part of initial HIV treatment.  Instead, it's typically reserved for patients who have already tried other antiretroviral therapies.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** The information below reflects previous FDA-approved dosages.  Current guidelines generally do not recommend fosamprenavir due to the availability of more effective and better-tolerated treatments.  **Always consult with your doctor or healthcare provider for the most up-to-date and appropriate dosage information.**

**Adults:**

* **Antiretroviral therapy-naive patients:**  Fosamprenavir dosages varied greatly depending on whether it was used with ritonavir (a boosting agent) and the dosing schedule (once or twice daily).  Dosages ranged from 700 mg twice daily to 1400 mg once daily (when boosted with ritonavir).  Unboosted regimens were also used with a dosage of 1400 mg twice daily.  Precise dosages should only be determined by a physician.

* **Protease inhibitor (PI)-experienced patients:**  A common regimen involved 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily.  Once-daily administration was not recommended for this group.

* **Pregnant patients:** Only a twice-daily regimen (700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily) was considered if a stable regimen of this dose was already being used prior to pregnancy and the patient showed virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA titer <50 copies/mL).

**Children:**  Fosamprenavir is no longer recommended for children due to low exposure levels. If used, it would be in combination with other antiretrovirals, and dosage would be determined by weight and age, ranging from 18 mg/kg twice daily to 45 mg/kg twice daily (with ritonavir).  Again, consult a physician for accurate dosing in this situation.


Dosage adjustments were needed for patients with hepatic impairment (reduced liver function).  Renal impairment (reduced kidney function) did not require dosage adjustments according to the manufacturer.  Specific dosage adjustments were also made based on co-administration of other medications like efavirenz or maraviroc.

**Forms:** Fosamprenavir was available in tablet and oral suspension forms.

### How it Works

Fosamprenavir is a prodrug; it is converted in the body to its active form, amprenavir. Amprenavir works by inhibiting HIV-1 protease, an enzyme crucial for the HIV virus to replicate.  By blocking this enzyme, amprenavir prevents the virus from producing infectious viral particles, thus hindering its ability to spread and cause further damage.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Fosamprenavir is contraindicated in patients with a clinically significant hypersensitivity to it or any components of the formulation, including amprenavir.  It is also contraindicated with specific medications that it interacts with in a dangerous way.

* **Drug Interactions:** Fosamprenavir interacts with many other drugs, sometimes increasing their levels to dangerous levels. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Fosamprenavir carries an increased risk of several conditions, including new-onset or worsening diabetes, spontaneous bleeding, changes in body fat distribution, lipid abnormalities, immune reconstitution syndrome, severe skin reactions, liver toxicity, and kidney stones.  Patients with underlying liver disease, hemophilia, or sulfonamide allergy should use it with caution.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss its use with their doctors.

* **Other important precautions:**  The oral suspension should be taken with food, while the tablet form can be taken with or without food, with the exception of ritonavir, which should be taken with food.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking fosamprenavir if I feel better?**  A: No, you should complete the full course of treatment prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better. Stopping early can lead to drug resistance and treatment failure.

* **Q: How should I store fosamprenavir?** A: Follow the storage instructions on the product label. Typically, it should be stored at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.  Consult your physician for appropriate advice regarding missed doses.

* **Q: Is fosamprenavir safe for pregnant women?** A:  The use of fosamprenavir during pregnancy is generally not recommended due to the availability of safer and more effective options for pregnant individuals living with HIV.

* **Q:  Is fosamprenavir safe for children?**  A:  Current guidelines do not recommend fosamprenavir for use in children.
