# Fampridine
### Generic Name
Fampridine

### Usage
Fampridine is primarily used to improve walking ability in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS).  It's a neurofunctional modifier, meaning it doesn't treat the underlying cause of MS but rather helps to improve the function of the nervous system to enhance walking.  It's important to note that fampridine is not a cure for MS and doesn't improve all MS symptoms.  Its use is specifically targeted at improving gait and walking difficulties.  There are currently no approved secondary uses for fampridine.

### Dosage
**Adults with Multiple Sclerosis:** The usual dosage is 10 mg taken orally every 12 hours. The maximum daily dose is 20 mg.  

**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of fampridine in children have not been established, and it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For adults with a creatinine clearance (ClCr) greater than 50 mL/min, the manufacturerâ€™s labeling doesn't specify dose adjustment, but caution is advised. Fampridine is contraindicated for adults with a ClCr of 50 mL/min or less.  

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Urinary tract infection

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Nausea
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Constipation
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Multiple sclerosis relapse
* Seizures
* Muscle weakness
* Balance disorder
* Back pain
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Pharyngolaryngeal pain (pain in the throat)
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above,  consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Fampridine is a potassium channel blocker. In individuals with MS, damage to the myelin sheath (the protective covering around nerve fibers) can disrupt the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Fampridine works by delaying the repolarization of nerve fibers, effectively prolonging the action potentials. This helps improve the conduction of nerve signals in demyelinated axons, leading to enhanced skeletal muscle fiber twitch activity and improved walking ability.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Fampridine is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures or hypersensitivity to fampridine or any component of its formulation. It's also contraindicated in adults with a creatinine clearance (ClCr) of 50 mL/min or less.

**Warnings:** Fampridine increases the risk of seizures, hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), and urinary tract infections.  Avoid overdosage.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Fampridine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Use during pregnancy should be avoided unless the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised if breastfeeding.

**Other Precautions:**  Patients should be well-hydrated while taking fampridine. Alcohol consumption should be avoided.  Avoid hazardous activities as dizziness and balance problems can occur. Abrupt withdrawal should be avoided.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I take fampridine with other medications?**
A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential drug interactions before taking fampridine with other medications, especially those affecting the kidneys or nervous system.


**Q: How should I store fampridine?**
A: Store fampridine as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.


**Q: Is fampridine addictive?**
A: Fampridine is not considered an addictive substance. However, abrupt discontinuation should be avoided as it could potentially lead to withdrawal symptoms.


**Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking fampridine?**
A: No, you should avoid alcohol while taking fampridine, as it can increase the risk of side effects.
