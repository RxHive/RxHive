# Flax
### Generic Name
Flax ( *Linum usitatissimum* L.)

### Usage
Flax, specifically flaxseed (but not flaxseed oil), is primarily used as a source of dietary fiber.  This fiber contributes to overall digestive health, promoting regularity and potentially easing constipation.  Flaxseed also contains lignans, a type of phytoestrogen, which may offer some health benefits.  Flaxseed oil, derived from flaxseed, is a rich source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid.  While not a primary use, ALA may play a role in cardiovascular health, though more research is needed to confirm these effects. Historically, flaxseed oil has been used topically as a demulcent and emollient, and also for coughs, colds, and urinary tract infections, though scientific evidence supporting these uses is limited.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the form of flax and the intended use.  It's crucial to note that the safety of ingesting more than 50g of flaxseed daily is not established.

* **Adult Oral Dosage:**
    * **Whole or ground flaxseed:** 5-50 grams per day.  Start with a smaller amount and gradually increase to assess tolerance.
    * **Flaxseed oil:** 4-60 milliliters per day.  Again, start with a lower dose and increase gradually.

* **Pediatric Oral Dosage:**
    *  Information on specific pediatric dosages for flaxseed is limited.  Always consult a pediatrician before giving flaxseed or flaxseed oil to a child.  A common recommendation is around 400 mg of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) in divided doses, but this should be confirmed by a healthcare professional.

**Administration:** Whole or ground flaxseed can be added to food or beverages. Flaxseed oil can be consumed directly or added to food.  Always follow specific instructions on any product you use.


### Side Effects
Common side effects, though frequency isn't well-defined, include:

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis in rare cases)
* Diarrhea (more common with flaxseed oil)
* Intestinal obstruction (especially in individuals with pre-existing conditions)

Less common but potentially serious side effects may also occur.  If any adverse effects develop, stop use and consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Flaxseed acts as a bulk-forming laxative by absorbing water in the intestines, increasing stool bulk and facilitating easier bowel movements. The lignans in flaxseed may have estrogenic effects, potentially influencing hormone-related processes in the body.  Flaxseed oil provides ALA, an essential fatty acid that the body uses to build cell membranes and produce anti-inflammatory compounds. The effects of ALA on cardiovascular health are still under investigation.


### Precautions
Flaxseed and flaxseed oil are contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with:

* Known allergy to flaxseed
* Bowel obstruction
* Certain cancers (breast, ovarian, uterine)
* Endometriosis
* Esophageal stricture (narrowing of the esophagus)
* Hormone-sensitive conditions
* Elevated triglyceride levels
* Intestinal inflammation
* Uterine fibroids

It is not recommended to use flaxseed or flaxseed oil during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking, including flaxseed or flaxseed oil, to avoid potential interactions.

### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take flaxseed every day?** A: While flaxseed offers potential health benefits, it's crucial to start with a small amount and increase gradually to monitor your tolerance.  Exceeding recommended dosages may lead to side effects.
* **Q: How should I store flaxseed and flaxseed oil?** A: Store flaxseed in a cool, dark, and dry place to maintain its quality and prevent rancidity. Flaxseed oil should be refrigerated after opening and used within a reasonable timeframe to avoid spoilage.
* **Q: Is flaxseed safe for everyone?** A:  No. Flaxseed and flaxseed oil are contraindicated for several conditions. Always consult a healthcare provider before incorporating flaxseed or flaxseed oil into your diet, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.
* **Q: What are the differences between whole flaxseed, ground flaxseed, and flaxseed oil?** A:  Whole flaxseed needs to be ground to release its nutrients effectively. Ground flaxseed is more easily digested. Flaxseed oil provides concentrated ALA but lacks the fiber of flaxseed.  Choose the form that best suits your needs and preferences, keeping in mind the nutritional differences.
