**Generic Name:** Faropenem sodium

**Usage:** Faropenem is a carbapenem antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Intra-abdominal infections:**  Infections of the abdomen, such as peritonitis (inflammation of the lining of the abdomen) and infections following abdominal surgery.

**Note:**  The specific infections faropenem is approved to treat may vary by country.  Always consult a healthcare professional for appropriate usage.  Faropenem is not effective against all bacteria, and susceptibility testing should be performed whenever possible.

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  *Pseudomembranous colitis (a serious intestinal infection caused by *Clostridium difficile*) is a potential, though rare, side effect.*

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary. Consult a healthcare professional if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:** Faropenem is a beta-lactam antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.  It binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in bacterial cells, preventing the formation of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of the bacterial cell wall. This disruption leads to bacterial cell lysis and death.  Faropenem has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
