# Fenofibrate + Ezetimibe

**Generic Name:** Fenofibrate/Ezetimibe (combination product – brand names vary)

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to lower high cholesterol and other fats (lipids) in the blood.  It's prescribed for people who have high cholesterol that isn't adequately controlled with ezetimibe or fenofibrate alone, and who are at risk for cardiovascular disease.  Specifically, it's often used when lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) aren't enough to lower cholesterol to a healthy level.  The combination helps to reduce LDL ("bad") cholesterol, triglycerides, and increase HDL ("good") cholesterol.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in frequency and severity. Common side effects may include:

* **Musculoskeletal:** Muscle aches, pains, or weakness (myalgia, rhabdomyolysis – a rare but serious condition).  This is a particular concern with fibrates.
* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation.
* **Liver:** Increased liver enzymes (indicated by blood tests).  Liver function tests are usually monitored during treatment.
* **Gallbladder:** Increased risk of gallstones.
* **Other:** Headache, dizziness, fatigue.

**Rare but serious side effects:**  These require immediate medical attention.  They include:

* **Rhabdomyolysis:** Severe muscle breakdown, a potentially life-threatening condition.  Symptoms include muscle pain, weakness, dark urine, and confusion.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Symptoms may include rash, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, and difficulty breathing.
* **Pancreatitis:** Inflammation of the pancreas.


**How it Works:**

* **Fenofibrate:**  Belongs to a class of drugs called fibrates. It works primarily by increasing the body's ability to break down and remove triglycerides and LDL cholesterol from the blood. It also slightly increases HDL cholesterol.
* **Ezetimibe:** Belongs to a class of drugs called cholesterol absorption inhibitors. It works by reducing the amount of cholesterol absorbed from the intestines into the bloodstream.

By combining these two drugs, the impact on lipid levels is often greater than using either medication alone.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How often do I need to take this medication?** A:  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Dosage and frequency vary depending on individual needs.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally okay, but excessive alcohol use can negatively interact with liver function and should be avoided.  Consult your doctor.
* **Q:  What are the potential drug interactions?** A: Several medications can interact with fenofibrate and ezetimibe.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some medications that may interact include certain statins, anticoagulants (blood thinners), and other cholesterol-lowering drugs.
* **Q:  What are the signs I should watch for that indicate a problem?** A: Watch for muscle pain, weakness, dark urine, jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes), severe stomach pain, and allergic reactions.  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any of these.
* **Q:  Will this medication cure my high cholesterol?** A: No, this medication helps to manage and control high cholesterol. Lifestyle changes remain crucial for long-term cholesterol management.  Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor cholesterol levels and adjust medication as needed.
