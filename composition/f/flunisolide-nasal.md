# Flunisolide (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Flunisolide (Nasal)

### Usage
Flunisolide nasal spray is a corticosteroid medication primarily used to manage nasal symptoms associated with both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  This means it helps relieve symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, and itchy nose caused by allergens in the air.  While its primary use is for allergic rhinitis, it may sometimes be used off-label for other inflammatory conditions of the nasal passages, but this should always be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical starting dose for allergic rhinitis is two sprays (50 mcg) in each nostril twice daily (BID), totaling 200 mcg per day.  This can be increased to two sprays in each nostril three times daily (TID), totaling 300 mcg per day, if needed.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 400 mcg (8 sprays per nostril).

**Children (6 years and older):**  For children aged 6 years and older and adolescents up to 14 years, the starting dose is typically one spray (25 mcg) in each nostril three times a day (TID) or two sprays (50 mcg) in each nostril twice a day (BID), resulting in a total daily dose of 150-200 mcg.  The maximum daily dose is 200 mcg (4 sprays per nostril).  For adolescents 15 years and older, the adult dosage guidelines apply.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. Always consult a doctor before adjusting the dosage.


**Administration:**  The nasal spray should be used as directed by a doctor or pharmacist. Before the first use, prime the pump by pressing it several times until a fine spray appears. Shake well before each use.  Blow your nose to clear your nostrils before administering the spray. Insert the applicator into a nostril, keeping the bottle upright, and close off the other nostril. Breathe in gently through your nose while pressing the pump to release the spray.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nasal congestion
* Stinging or burning sensation in the nose
* Dry nose
* Nasal irritation
* Sneezing
* Loss of sense of smell (anosmia)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Nasal ulceration (soreness or wounds in the nose)


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Flunisolide is a corticosteroid, a type of anti-inflammatory medication.  It works by binding to glucocorticoid receptors within cells in the nasal passages. This binding reduces the release of inflammatory substances like leukotrienes and prostaglandins, which are responsible for the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. By suppressing inflammation, flunisolide helps relieve nasal congestion, sneezing, itching, and runny nose.  It also has some effects on the immune system in the nasal passages, further reducing allergic responses.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Flunisolide nasal spray should not be used by individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to flunisolide or any component of the formulation.
* Active or inactive tuberculosis.
* Untreated fungal, bacterial, or viral infections of the nose.
* Children under 6 years of age.
* Untreated local infection in the nasal passages.
* Patients with a history of recent nasal surgery or injury.


**Interactions:**  Flunisolide may interact with other medications.  For example, concurrent use with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration.  Use with certain other medications, such as potassium-depleting diuretics, may also increase the risk of adverse effects. Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking.

**Warnings:**

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Flunisolide is categorized as a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its safety during pregnancy has not been fully established.  Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Consult a healthcare provider.
* **Children:** Monitor children's growth while they are using this medication long-term.
* **Long-Term Use:** Prolonged use may increase the risk of local infections (like fungal infections) or other adverse effects.  Always follow your doctor's instructions on duration of use.
* **Bone Health:**  Long-term use of corticosteroids can potentially affect bone mineral density, especially in individuals with risk factors for osteoporosis.


### FAQs
