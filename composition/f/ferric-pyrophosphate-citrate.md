# Ferric Pyrophosphate Citrate
### Generic Name
Ferric Pyrophosphate Citrate

### Usage
Ferric pyrophosphate citrate is primarily used to replenish iron levels in adult patients with hemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (HDD-CKD).  Its main purpose is to help maintain adequate hemoglobin levels, which are often deficient in these patients due to the limitations of their kidney function and dialysis treatment.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is specifically designed for intravenous administration during hemodialysis and is not suitable for treating iron deficiency in other patient populations.

### Dosage
The dosage of Ferric pyrophosphate citrate is expressed as milligrams of iron (III).  One milliliter of the intravenous injection contains 1.5 mg of iron (III).  For adult patients with HDD-CKD, the recommended dose is 6.75 mg of iron (III) administered as a slow, continuous intravenous infusion over 3-4 hours. This infusion is typically given during each hemodialysis session, via the pre-dialyzer, post-dialyzer infusion line, or a separate venous line connection. The medication should continue to be administered for as long as the patient requires maintenance hemodialysis.  **The use of Ferric pyrophosphate citrate in children has not been established as safe and effective.**

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include procedural hypotension.

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include:

*   Headache
*   Fatigue
*   Dizziness
*   Constipation
*   Nausea
*   Peripheral edema
*   Clotted arteriovenous (AV) fistula
*   Dialysis access hemorrhage
*   Pruritus (itching)
*   Urinary tract infection
*   Muscle spasms
*   Limb pain
*   Back pain
*   Weakness
*   Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
*   Fever


Less common, but serious side effects, such as anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported.  **If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.**

### How it Works
Ferric pyrophosphate citrate is added to the hemodialysis solution. During dialysis, it crosses the dialyzer membrane and enters the patient's bloodstream. The iron in the medication binds to transferrin, a protein that transports iron in the blood.  This iron-transferrin complex then delivers iron to erythroid precursor cells (cells that develop into red blood cells) in the bone marrow.  The iron is subsequently incorporated into hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.  By increasing iron availability, Ferric pyrophosphate citrate helps to improve hemoglobin levels and address anemia associated with HDD-CKD.

### Precautions
While no specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling, there is an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.  Careful monitoring for hypersensitivity reactions is crucial during and after each dialysis session.  Predialysis blood samples should be used to assess iron status, as postdialysis measurements may overestimate iron levels.  The medication's effects may be increased by dimercaprol (a chelating agent).  Further, the safety of Ferric pyrophosphate citrate during pregnancy is categorized as C;  excretion in breast milk is unknown. The benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed against the potential risks to the infant.  Always consult a physician before using this medication if pregnant or breastfeeding.

### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take Ferric pyrophosphate citrate if I have other medical conditions?**  A:  This medication is specifically for HDD-CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis.  Consult your doctor to determine its suitability if you have other health issues.

*   **Q: How is Ferric pyrophosphate citrate stored?** A: Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions. Generally, medications should be stored as directed by the manufacturer.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Since this medication is administered during hemodialysis, missed doses will be addressed during the next scheduled dialysis session.  However, it is essential to discuss any missed sessions with your doctor or dialysis center.

*   **Q:  Are there any specific dietary considerations while using Ferric pyrophosphate citrate?** A:  Consult your doctor or a registered dietitian for advice on diet and nutrition while undergoing hemodialysis and taking this medication.  Maintaining a balanced diet is crucial.

*   **Q: Can I stop taking Ferric pyrophosphate citrate without consulting my doctor?** A: No, abruptly stopping any medication, including Ferric pyrophosphate citrate, can have negative health consequences.  Always consult your physician before making changes to your treatment plan.
