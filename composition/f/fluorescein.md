# Fluorescein
### Generic Name
Fluorescein

### Usage
Fluorescein is a fluorescent dye primarily used in ophthalmology and other medical diagnostic procedures.  Its main use is in assessing the integrity of the cornea and tear film in the eye.  This involves instilling a drop of fluorescein solution into the eye, which then highlights any corneal abrasions, ulcers, or other damage under a blue light (Wood's lamp). This allows ophthalmologists to visualize subtle damage that might otherwise be missed. Fluorescein is also used to assess tear production (Schirmer's test), detect corneal foreign bodies, and evaluate the patency of the nasolacrimal duct (the drainage system of the eye). Beyond ophthalmology, fluorescein can be used in angiography (to visualize blood vessels) and in other diagnostic imaging techniques, though these uses are less common.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific application.  There isn't a standardized "dosage" in the way many oral medications have.  In ophthalmic use, one or two drops of a typically 0.25% to 2% fluorescein sodium solution are instilled into the conjunctival sac (the space between the eyelid and the eyeball). For angiography, the dosage is determined by the specific procedure and administered intravenously.  Children typically receive the same dosage as adults for ophthalmic applications,  though the volume administered may be adjusted based on the age and size of the child, always under the guidance of an ophthalmologist.  **It is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for the appropriate dosage in any specific situation.**  There is no oral administration of fluorescein for diagnostic purposes.

### Side Effects
* **Eye irritation:**  This is the most common side effect, often manifesting as temporary stinging, burning, or redness.
* **Temporary yellow discoloration of the urine:** This is harmless and resolves on its own.
* **Allergic reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions, such as skin rash or itching, can occur.
* **Staining of the skin and clothing:** Fluorescein can stain skin and clothing temporarily; washing with soap and water usually removes the stain.
* **Rare serious side effects:** Although rare, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) can occur.  These require immediate medical attention.

**Note:**  If any significant or concerning side effects are experienced, it's crucial to seek immediate medical advice.

### How it Works
Fluorescein is a highly fluorescent dye, meaning it absorbs light at one wavelength (blue light) and emits light at a longer wavelength (yellow-green light).  When instilled into the eye or injected intravenously, it binds to damaged tissues or blood vessels, making them brightly visible under ultraviolet (UV) or blue light. This allows clinicians to visualize these areas and make accurate diagnoses.  The mechanism for its staining ability lies in its interaction with proteins and tissue components.

### Precautions
* **Allergy:**  Patients with a known allergy to fluorescein should avoid using it.
* **Contact lenses:**  Contact lenses should be removed before fluorescein is administered.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe for these groups, it is best to consult a doctor before using fluorescein during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Drug interactions:** There are no significant drug interactions known with fluorescein.
* **Intravascular administration:**  The intravenous use of fluorescein requires strict medical supervision due to potential adverse effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the yellow staining last?** A: The yellow staining of the skin and urine is usually temporary and resolves within a few hours to a day.
* **Q: Is fluorescein harmful to the eyes?** A: Fluorescein is generally well-tolerated, but temporary stinging or irritation is common.  Serious harm is rare.
* **Q: Can I drive after using fluorescein eye drops?** A:  The temporary blurring of vision immediately after instillation may impair driving ability; it's advisable to wait until vision clears before driving.
* **Q: How is fluorescein stored?** A:  Fluorescein should be stored according to the instructions on the label. Typically, this involves storage at room temperature and protection from light.
* **Q: Is fluorescein available over-the-counter?** A: While some fluorescein solutions might be available without a prescription for ophthalmic use, it's crucial to consult an eye care professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.  Intravenous administration is always under the direction of a medical professional.
