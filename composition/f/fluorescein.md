# Fluorescein

**Generic Name:** Fluorescein sodium (also known as fluorescein)

**Usage:**

Fluorescein is primarily used as a diagnostic dye.  Its applications include:

* **Ophthalmology:**  To stain the cornea and assess for corneal abrasions, ulcers, or other damage.  It's also used in angiography to visualize blood vessels in the eye.
* **Angiography:** To visualize blood vessels in various parts of the body (e.g., coronary arteries, peripheral arteries).  This requires intravenous injection.
* **Gastrointestinal procedures:** To help visualize leaks, fistulas, or other abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Lymphangiography:** To visualize lymphatic vessels.
* **Other diagnostic uses:**  It can be used to detect leaks in various systems, such as the urinary tract or cerebrospinal fluid system.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild and temporary, but can include:

* **Transient stinging or burning sensation:** Particularly common with ophthalmic use.
* **Temporary yellow discoloration of urine and skin:**  This is typically harmless and resolves within 24-48 hours.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to anaphylaxis) can occur.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  More common with intravenous administration.
* **Headache:**  Can occur with intravenous administration.


**How it Works:**

Fluorescein is a fluorescent dye.  When exposed to ultraviolet (UV) or blue light, it emits a bright yellow-green fluorescence.  This fluorescence allows visualization of structures and tissues that otherwise wouldn't be readily visible.  In ophthalmology, it highlights areas of corneal damage due to the dye's affinity for damaged tissue. In angiography, it highlights the blood vessels by traveling within the bloodstream.


**FAQs:**

* **Is fluorescein safe?** Generally, fluorescein is considered safe when used as directed by a healthcare professional.  However, allergic reactions are possible, albeit rare.
* **How long does the yellow discoloration last?** The yellow discoloration of urine and skin usually resolves within 24-48 hours.
* **What should I do if I have an allergic reaction?** Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness after fluorescein administration.
* **Can fluorescein be used at home?** No, fluorescein should only be administered by a healthcare professional, as it requires specific expertise and equipment for proper application and interpretation of results.
* **Is fluorescein toxic?** While generally considered non-toxic in the amounts used for diagnostic purposes, ingestion of large quantities can be harmful.
