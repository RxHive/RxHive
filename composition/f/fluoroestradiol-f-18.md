# Fluoroestradiol F 18
### Generic Name
Fluoroestradiol F 18

### Usage
Fluoroestradiol F 18 is a radioactive diagnostic agent used with positron-emission tomography (PET) scans.  Its primary use is in detecting estrogen receptor (ER)-positive lesions in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.  It acts as an adjunct to biopsy, helping to pinpoint areas for further investigation.  It's important to note that Fluoroestradiol F 18 does *not* image other receptors like HER2 or the progesterone receptor (PR). A tissue biopsy is crucial to confirm breast cancer recurrence and verify ER status.

### Dosage
**Radioimaging:**  The standard adult dose is 6 mCi (222 MBq), administered as a single intravenous (IV) injection of 10 mL or less over 1-2 minutes.  The dosage range is typically 3-6 mCi (111-222 MBq).

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Fluoroestradiol F 18 in pediatric patients have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are specified in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in less than 1% of patients) include:

*   Dysgeusia (altered taste)
*   Pain at the injection site

While rare, it's crucial to report any adverse effects to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Fluoroestradiol F 18 works by binding to estrogen receptors (ER). The F18 isotope within the molecule emits positrons, which are detected by a PET scanner.  Areas with a high concentration of ER-positive cells will show increased uptake of Fluoroestradiol F 18, thus appearing as "hot spots" on the PET scan. This helps to identify the location of potential cancerous lesions.

### Precautions
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Fluoroestradiol F 18, like all radiopharmaceuticals, has the potential to harm a developing fetus.  Breastfeeding should be avoided for at least 4 hours after administration to minimize radiation exposure to the infant.  Pregnancy status should be evaluated in women of reproductive potential before administering this medication.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Medications like tamoxifen and fulvestrant, which block estrogen receptors, will reduce Fluoroestradiol F 18 uptake.  However,  essential cancer therapy shouldn't be delayed to perform this imaging. Imaging should be completed *before* starting systemic endocrine therapies that target the estrogen receptor.
*   **Increased Risk:** There's an increased risk of misdiagnosis and radiation exposure associated with the use of Fluoroestradiol F 18.
*   **General Considerations:**  Only trained and experienced personnel should handle and administer Fluoroestradiol F 18. Appropriate safety measures and radiation shielding are essential during preparation and administration. Patients should be well-hydrated before and after the injection to minimize bladder radiation exposure, and encouraged to urinate frequently in the initial hours post-injection.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take to get the results of a Fluoroestradiol F 18 PET scan?**  A:  The imaging is typically performed approximately 80 minutes after injection. The interpretation of the scan requires a skilled radiologist and the results are usually available within a few days.


*   **Q: Are there any long-term side effects?** A:  Long-term side effects related to Fluoroestradiol F 18 are not typically reported.  The primary concern is the radiation exposure, which is minimized through appropriate handling and patient management practices.

*   **Q: How is Fluoroestradiol F 18 stored?** A: Fluoroestradiol F 18 is a radiopharmaceutical and requires specialized handling and storage under controlled conditions, as dictated by local radiation safety regulations and guidelines. It is not intended for home storage.

*   **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?**  A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects after receiving Fluoroestradiol F 18.

*   **Q:  Is Fluoroestradiol F 18 right for me?** A: Your doctor will determine if Fluoroestradiol F 18 PET imaging is appropriate based on your specific medical history, symptoms, and other diagnostic findings. This should be discussed with your healthcare provider to determine suitability and potential risks.
