# Fusidic Acid (Topical)
### Generic Name
Fusidic Acid (Topical)

### Usage
Fusidic acid topical is a type of antibiotic used to treat bacterial skin infections.  Its primary use is in the treatment of both primary and secondary skin infections.  Primary infections are those that occur on otherwise healthy skin, such as impetigo contagiosa (a highly contagious bacterial skin infection) and erythrasma (a bacterial infection causing reddish-brown patches in skin folds). Secondary infections occur in areas of pre-existing skin damage, examples include infected wounds and burns.  It's important to note that fusidic acid topical is only effective against certain types of bacteria; it won't work against viral or fungal infections.

### Dosage
The typical dosage for adults and children is the same:  a small amount of the 2% ointment, cream, or gel should be applied to the affected area two to three times daily for seven to fourteen days.  If a gauze dressing is used, application may be reduced to once or twice daily.  The duration of treatment might need to be adjusted depending on the severity of the infection and the clinical response.  For severe or persistent infections, a healthcare professional might recommend additional systemic (oral or intravenous) antibiotics.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  This medication is for external use only; avoid contact with the eyes.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Application site irritation
* Application site pain
* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin rash


Less common, but more serious, side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema)
* Skin blistering
* Conjunctivitis (if accidentally applied near the eyes)


If you experience any side effects, particularly severe ones, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works
Fusidic acid is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, meaning it inhibits the growth and reproduction of bacteria. It achieves this by interfering with the protein synthesis process within susceptible bacterial cells.  By preventing bacteria from producing essential proteins, fusidic acid effectively stops their growth and allows the body's immune system to clear the infection.

### Precautions
Fusidic acid topical is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to fusidic acid or any component of the formulation.  There is an increased risk of skin reactions, such as contact dermatitis.  The potential for superinfection (a secondary infection caused by a different organism) also exists, especially with fungal organisms.  Therefore, close monitoring for any signs of new infections is warranted. Although data is limited, use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered, and only used when the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications you are taking to avoid potential drug interactions, although significant interactions are currently unknown.  Children should only use fusidic acid under the direct supervision of a healthcare provider.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see improvement?** A: Improvement should be noticeable within a few days, but complete clearing of the infection may take the full course of treatment (7-14 days).
* **Q: Can I use fusidic acid on open wounds?** A: Yes, but it's crucial to have the wound properly cleaned and assessed by a doctor first.
* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get fusidic acid in my eyes?** A: Rinse your eyes immediately with plenty of cool water and seek medical attention if irritation persists.
* **Q: How should I store fusidic acid?** A: Store as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Discard any unused ointment after three months of opening.
* **Q: Is fusidic acid safe for long-term use?** A:  Prolonged use isn't recommended.  Consult your doctor for guidance if your infection persists after the recommended course of treatment.
