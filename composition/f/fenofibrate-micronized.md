# Fenofibrate Micronized
### Generic Name
Fenofibrate Micronized

### Usage

Fenofibrate micronized is a medication primarily used to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood.  It's prescribed as an adjunct to diet, meaning it's most effective when combined with a healthy eating plan.  Specifically, it's indicated for the treatment of:

* **Hypercholesterolemia:** High levels of cholesterol in the blood. This includes both primary hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol with no known cause) and mixed dyslipidemia (a combination of high cholesterol and high triglycerides).
* **Hypertriglyceridemia:** High levels of triglycerides in the blood. This is particularly helpful for those with Fredrickson types IV and V hyperlipidemia, specific classifications of high triglyceride disorders.

Fenofibrate helps to manage these lipid abnormalities, reducing the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke in individuals with elevated cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation of fenofibrate micronized (different strengths of capsules are available), the patient's condition, and other factors like kidney function.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.

**Adults:**

* **Hypercholesterolemia/Mixed Dyslipidemia:**  Dosage ranges widely, starting as low as 43 mg/day and going up to 200 mg/day, usually taken once daily. The dosage is often adjusted based on the patient's response to treatment.  Some formulations are taken with food, others with or without.  
* **Hypertriglyceridemia:**  Dosage similarly varies from 43 mg/day to 200 mg/day, and adjustments are typically made every 4-8 weeks based on response.  Again, some formulations should be taken with food.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of fenofibrate micronized in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Kidney problems (renal impairment):**  Dosage should be adjusted or avoided altogether in patients with severe kidney impairment.  Lower doses may be used for mild-to-moderate impairment.
* **Liver problems (hepatic impairment):**  Fenofibrate micronized is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease.  Regular monitoring of liver function is crucial.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Headache
* Abdominal pain
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT and AST)
* Backache

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle tissue)
* Cholestatic hepatitis (a type of liver inflammation)
* Deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in a deep vein)
* Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung)

If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Fenofibrate micronized works by activating a receptor called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha). This activation leads to several beneficial effects on lipid metabolism:

* Increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which helps break down triglycerides.
* Decreased production of apolipoprotein C-III, a protein that inhibits triglyceride breakdown.
* Increased production of HDL cholesterol ("good" cholesterol).

These actions combine to lower levels of triglycerides and "bad" cholesterol (LDL cholesterol), while raising levels of HDL cholesterol, ultimately improving overall lipid profiles.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fenofibrate micronized should not be used by people with hypersensitivity to fenofibrate or its components, severe kidney disease, active liver disease, pre-existing gallbladder disease, or who are breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Fenofibrate can interact with other medications, including statins, some blood thinners, and others. It's crucial to inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Fenofibrate is a pregnancy Category C drug, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been fully established.  It's contraindicated in breastfeeding women.
* **Gallbladder Disease:** Increased risk of gallbladder problems.
* **Muscle Problems (Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis):**  There's an increased risk of muscle damage, especially when combined with statin drugs. Regular monitoring of muscle enzymes (creatine kinase) may be necessary.
* **Liver Function:** Regular monitoring of liver function is recommended.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take fenofibrate with other cholesterol-lowering medications?** A:  Discuss this with your doctor.  While it is sometimes used with statins, close monitoring is needed due to increased risk of muscle problems.
* **Q: How should I store fenofibrate?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't take two doses at once.
* **Q: Can I stop taking fenofibrate suddenly?** A: No, always follow your doctor's instructions regarding stopping the medication.  Sudden cessation might lead to a rebound in lipid levels.
* **Q:  What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.
