# Flurazepam

**Generic Name:** Flurazepam

**Usage:** Flurazepam is a benzodiazepine used to treat insomnia characterized by difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, or early morning awakenings.  It's typically prescribed for short-term use only, usually no longer than 2-4 weeks, due to the risk of dependence and tolerance.  It's not intended for long-term use.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects include:

* **Daytime drowsiness:** This is a very common and potentially dangerous side effect.
* **Dizziness:** Can impair coordination and increase fall risk.
* **Confusion:** Especially in elderly patients.
* **Headache:**  A frequent complaint.
* **Weakness:**  Generalized fatigue.
* **Memory problems:**  Short-term memory impairment.
* **Unsteady gait:**  Difficulty walking.
* **Nausea:**  Gastrointestinal upset.
* **Dependence and withdrawal:**  With prolonged use, dependence can develop, leading to unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if the medication is stopped abruptly.  Withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, insomnia, seizures, and tremors.
* **Paradoxical effects:**  In some individuals, flurazepam can cause increased anxiety, agitation, or aggression.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions are possible.

**How it Works:** Flurazepam enhances the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve activity in the brain. This leads to a calming effect and promotes sleep.
