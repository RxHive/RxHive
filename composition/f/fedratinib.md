# Fedratinib
### Generic Name
Fedratinib

### Usage

Fedratinib is a medication primarily used to treat adults with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary or secondary myelofibrosis.  Secondary myelofibrosis refers to the condition developing after polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.  It works by targeting specific proteins involved in the disease process, helping to manage symptoms and potentially improve overall health outcomes for patients with this type of bone marrow disorder.  Currently, there are no approved uses of Fedratinib in children.

### Dosage

The standard adult dosage of Fedratinib is 400 mg once daily (OD) orally.  However, this is contingent upon the patient's baseline platelet count being ≥50 x 10⁹/L.  Dosage adjustments are crucial and depend on several factors.

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, dosage adjustments aren't explicitly stated in the manufacturer's labeling; however,  studies suggest no clinically meaningful impact on pharmacokinetics.  Severe hepatic impairment necessitates avoiding Fedratinib altogether.  Dose reductions are necessary if grade 3 elevations in liver enzymes (ALT, AST, or bilirubin) occur during treatment.

* **Renal Impairment:**  Patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min generally don't require an initial dosage adjustment.  However, those with moderate impairment (CrCl 15-29 mL/min) should have their dose reduced to 200 mg OD.  Close monitoring is necessary in both cases.

* **Toxicity Management:**  Dose reductions or interruptions are frequently required due to various side effects. This includes anemia, neutropenia (low neutrophils), thrombocytopenia (low platelets), gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), and elevated amylase or lipase levels.  The specific adjustment depends on the severity and type of toxicity.

* **Concomitant Use with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** If administered alongside strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, the Fedratinib dose must be reduced to 200 mg OD. Once the CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the Fedratinib dose should be carefully increased over a couple of weeks, up to 400 mg OD if tolerated.

* **Transitioning from Ruxolitinib:** When switching from ruxolitinib to Fedratinib, the ruxolitinib dose should be tapered and then discontinued before starting Fedratinib.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Fedratinib in children haven't been established.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Fatigue
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Increased serum lipase levels
* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels)
* Increased amylase levels
* Anemia
* Thrombocytopenia
* Neutropenia
* Increased serum ALT levels
* Increased serum AST levels
* Asthenia (weakness)
* Muscle spasms
* Increased serum creatinine levels

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Cardiac failure
* Hypertension
* Cardiogenic shock
* Weight gain
* Dysuria (painful urination)
* Urinary tract infection
* Severe anemia
* Limb pain
* Ostealgia (bone pain)
* Encephalopathy (including Wernicke's encephalopathy) – This is a serious and potentially fatal side effect, see precautions.
* Severe gastrointestinal toxicity


Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Fedratinib is a kinase inhibitor.  Specifically, it inhibits Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3).  Abnormal JAK2 activity is linked to myeloproliferative neoplasms like myelofibrosis. By blocking JAK2, Fedratinib reduces the activity of proteins involved in cell growth and signaling, potentially slowing the disease's progression and alleviating symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Thiamine Deficiency and Encephalopathy:** Fedratinib carries a boxed warning regarding the risk of serious and potentially fatal encephalopathy, including Wernicke's encephalopathy.  Baseline and periodic monitoring of thiamine levels is essential.  The medication should not be initiated if thiamine deficiency is present.

* **Hepatotoxicity:**  Liver function should be monitored regularly.

* **Hematologic Effects:**  Close monitoring of blood counts (CBC with platelets) is critical due to the risk of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.

* **Gastrointestinal Toxicity:**  Patients should be advised on managing diarrhea promptly.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Fedratinib interacts with various other drugs.  Consult a healthcare professional about potential interactions before taking other medications concurrently.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The benefits and risks must be carefully weighed when prescribing Fedratinib to pregnant women.  Breastfeeding is contraindicated during treatment and for at least one month after the final dose.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Fedratinib with food?** A:  Fedratinib can be taken with or without food, but taking it with a high-fat meal may reduce nausea and vomiting.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the next scheduled dose the following day. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Fedratinib?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided with your prescription.

* **Q:  Are there any specific warnings for older adults?** A:  Older adults may be more susceptible to certain side effects.  Close monitoring is essential.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately to report any concerning side effects.  Do not stop taking the medication without consulting your doctor.
