# Fluticasone Furoate
### Generic Name
Fluticasone Furoate

### Usage
Fluticasone furoate is a corticosteroid medication primarily used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's an inhaled medication, meaning it's delivered directly to the lungs, reducing inflammation in the airways. This helps to relieve symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness.  In asthma, it's often used as a preventative medication to control inflammation and reduce the frequency of asthma attacks.  In COPD, it helps manage symptoms and improve lung function. While its primary use is in respiratory conditions, it may also be used in some cases of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) as a nasal spray.

### Dosage

Dosage of fluticasone furoate varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated, the formulation (inhaler, nasal spray), the age and weight of the patient, and the severity of the symptoms.  It's **crucial** to follow the prescribing doctor's instructions exactly.  There is no standardized dosage information applicable to all situations.  

* **Inhaled Fluticasone Furoate for Asthma and COPD:** Dosage is typically prescribed in micrograms per day, and the number of inhalations required will depend on the strength of the inhaler. Dosages range widely (from very low to high doses) and are adjusted based on individual patient response and disease severity.  Children's dosages are generally lower than adult dosages.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.  Incorrect usage can lead to inadequate treatment or unwanted side effects.

* **Nasal Spray Fluticasone Furoate (Allergic Rhinitis):** Dosage will be specified in sprays per day, typically one or two sprays in each nostril, depending on the severity of the allergic symptoms. Again, children’s dosages will typically be lower than those for adults.

**Important Note:** This information is for general knowledge only.  Never attempt to self-adjust the dosage. Always consult with a healthcare professional for proper guidance on dosage and administration.

### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**
    * Hoarseness
    * Throat irritation
    * Cough
    * Oral thrush (fungal infection in the mouth)
    * Headache

* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** These require immediate medical attention.
    * Increased risk of pneumonia (particularly in COPD patients)
    * Vision problems (blurred vision, cataracts, glaucoma)
    * Osteoporosis (weakening of the bones, particularly with long-term use)
    * Slowed growth in children
    * Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties) – stop medication and seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.


If you experience any side effects, particularly unusual or severe ones, contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Fluticasone furoate is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation in the airways.  It binds to specific receptors in the cells lining the airways, suppressing the release of inflammatory substances.  This reduces swelling, narrowing of the airways, and the production of mucus, ultimately improving airflow and relieving respiratory symptoms.  The effect is primarily preventative, working to control underlying inflammation rather than providing immediate relief of acute symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Fluticasone furoate is generally contraindicated in people with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug or any of its components.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Although relatively few drug interactions are known, it's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.

* **Specific Warnings:**
    * **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of fluticasone furoate during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only used if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Consult your doctor.
    * **Children:**  Children's dosage must be determined by a physician and closely monitored.
    * **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, particularly osteoporosis.  Regular monitoring is important.
    * **Patients with liver or kidney disease:** The dosage might need to be adjusted, as these organs play a role in the metabolism and excretion of the medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking fluticasone furoate suddenly?**
   * **A:** No.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a worsening of symptoms and potentially trigger an asthma or COPD exacerbation. Always taper off the medication gradually as directed by your doctor.

* **Q: How should I store fluticasone furoate?**
   * **A:** Store it as directed on the product label.  Generally, this means storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I use fluticasone furoate for a cold?**
   * **A:** Fluticasone furoate is not a treatment for the common cold.  It is for long-term management of asthma and COPD.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
   * **A:** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double the dose.

* **Q: Is fluticasone furoate addictive?**
   * **A:** Fluticasone furoate is not addictive.
