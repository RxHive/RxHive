# Fluticasone Furoate

**Generic Name:** Fluticasone Furoate

**Usage:** Fluticasone furoate is a corticosteroid used to prevent and control symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's inhaled, meaning it's delivered directly to the lungs, reducing systemic side effects compared to oral corticosteroids.  Specific uses include:

* **Asthma:** Preventing asthma attacks and reducing inflammation in the airways. Often used in combination with a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) such as salmeterol or formoterol.
* **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):** Reducing the frequency and severity of exacerbations (worsening of symptoms) in patients with COPD.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, fluticasone furoate can cause side effects, although many people experience none or only mild ones.  Common side effects include:

* **Throat irritation:** Hoarseness, dry mouth, or throat pain.
* **Oral thrush (candidiasis):** A fungal infection in the mouth.  Rinsing the mouth with water after each inhalation can help prevent this.
* **Headache:**
* **Cough:**
* **Muscle aches:**

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* **Increased risk of infections:**  Corticosteroids can suppress the immune system.
* **Cataracts and glaucoma:** Increased risk with prolonged use.
* **Osteoporosis:**  Long-term use can increase the risk of bone thinning.
* **Slowed growth in children:**  A concern with long-term use in children.
* **Paradoxic bronchospasm:**  Rare but potentially serious; characterized by worsening wheezing and shortness of breath after inhalation.


**How it Works:** Fluticasone furoate is a potent inhaled corticosteroid.  It works by reducing inflammation in the airways.  Inflammation is a key component of asthma and COPD, causing airway narrowing and increased mucus production.  By reducing inflammation, fluticasone furoate helps to open the airways, making breathing easier and reducing symptoms.
