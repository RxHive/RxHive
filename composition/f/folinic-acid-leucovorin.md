# Folinic Acid/ Leucovorin
### Generic Name
Folinic Acid/Leucovorin

### Usage
Folinic acid, also known as leucovorin, is primarily used as a rescue medication to counteract the toxic effects of methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug.  Methotrexate works by inhibiting an enzyme crucial for DNA synthesis, and folinic acid helps to restore normal cell function by providing a form of folate that can bypass the methotrexate blockade.  This is particularly important in high-dose methotrexate regimens used to treat certain cancers.

Beyond its use as a methotrexate rescue agent, folinic acid has a secondary role in treating megaloblastic anemia resulting from folate deficiency.  It's also sometimes used in combination with fluorouracil (5-FU), another chemotherapy drug, to enhance its anti-cancer effects in treating various cancers, including colorectal, head and neck, and esophageal cancers.  The combination therapy leverages the differing mechanisms of action of folinic acid and 5-FU to improve treatment efficacy.  Finally, it can be used to treat toxicity from other folate antagonists such as trimethoprim and pyrimethamine.

### Dosage
Dosage for folinic acid varies greatly depending on the specific indication and the patient's condition.  There's no single "standard" dose. Here's a summary; always follow a healthcare professional's precise instructions.

**Methotrexate Overdose (Adult):** Treatment varies greatly based on the severity of the overdose and the serum methotrexate level.  It can range from a low dose of 25 mg orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly to much higher doses administered intravenously every 3 hours until methotrexate levels are in a safe range.  The specific regimen is determined by monitoring methotrexate blood levels and kidney function.


**High-Dose Methotrexate Rescue (Adult & Pediatric):**  The dosage is calculated based on body surface area (m²) and is given intravenously, orally, or intramuscularly after a high dose of methotrexate. This dosage also needs careful monitoring and adjustment according to methotrexate serum levels and kidney function.


**Advanced Colorectal Cancer (with 5-FU):**  The dosage is high, given intravenously in combination with 5-FU for several days. Doses are often individualized and adjusted based on tolerance and response.

**Megaloblastic Anemia:** Doses are generally much lower, typically 1 mg daily.

**Trimethoprim/Pyrimethamine Toxicity (Adult & Pediatric):**  Treatment involves doses ranging from 5-15 mg per day until blood cell production returns to normal.


**Pediatric Dosage:** Pediatric doses are generally calculated based on body surface area (mg/m²) and are significantly lower than adult doses.  Again, close monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential.


**Important:**  This is not an exhaustive list and does not cover all possible dosage scenarios.  Precise dosages should always be determined and monitored by a healthcare professional experienced in chemotherapy or managing folate deficiencies.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of folinic acid are generally mild.  However, serious, though less frequent, adverse reactions can occur.  If you experience any of the following, especially those marked with an asterisk (*), seek immediate medical attention:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Mouth sores (stomatitis)
* Skin rash, itching, or hives
* Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis)*
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)*
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)*
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Wheezing


### How it Works
Folinic acid is a reduced form of folic acid, a B vitamin essential for DNA synthesis and cell division.  When used as a methotrexate rescue agent, it works by bypassing the enzyme that methotrexate inhibits. This allows cells to continue with DNA synthesis and prevents the toxic effects of methotrexate on rapidly dividing cells, such as those in the bone marrow.  When used with 5-FU, folinic acid enhances the drug's effectiveness by increasing the incorporation of 5-FU into DNA, leading to more effective cell death in cancer cells.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Folinic acid is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the drug.
* **Vitamin B12 Deficiency:** Use caution in patients with megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency, as folinic acid may mask the symptoms.
* **Drug Interactions:** Folinic acid can interact with other medications, particularly those used in cancer treatment such as methotrexate and 5-FU.  Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking.  Concomitant use with certain anticonvulsants may increase the risk of seizures.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Folinic acid is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are unknown.  It's also secreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.  Healthcare providers should assess the risks and benefits carefully.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  While specific dosage adjustments are not always clearly defined,  patients with impaired kidney or liver function might require careful dose monitoring and adjustments due to potential difficulties in metabolism or excretion.



### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take folinic acid without a prescription?** A: No, folinic acid should only be taken under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.  Self-medicating can be dangerous.

* **Q: How should I store folinic acid?** A: Store it according to the instructions on the label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not try to make up for a missed dose.  Contact your healthcare provider for guidance.

* **Q: Is folinic acid safe for long-term use?** A:  The safety of long-term use depends greatly on the indication and the dosage.  Close monitoring by your doctor is always needed.

* **Q:  What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any significant or concerning side effects.  Some side effects might require immediate medical attention.
