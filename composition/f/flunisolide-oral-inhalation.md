# Flunisolide (Oral inhalation)
### Generic Name
Flunisolide (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage

Flunisolide oral inhalation is a corticosteroid used for the long-term maintenance treatment of asthma in adults and children aged 6 years and older.  Its primary role is preventative; it helps to control inflammation in the airways, reducing the frequency and severity of asthma attacks.  It's particularly useful for patients whose asthma is not adequately controlled with other medications or who require oral corticosteroids, as adding flunisolide can sometimes reduce or eliminate the need for systemic steroids.  It's crucial to understand that flunisolide is *not* a rescue medication for immediate relief of acute asthma symptoms (like shortness of breath during an attack).  For that, a quick-relief inhaler (like albuterol) is necessary.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on age and the severity of asthma.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  The following is general guidance only and should not be interpreted as a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Adults (Asthma):**

* **Starting Dose:** Typically, 160 mcg twice daily (BID), administered via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI).  This may be adjusted based on individual response.
* **Maximum Dose:**  Generally, no more than 320 mcg BID.
* **Titration:**  The dose should be gradually reduced to the lowest effective amount once asthma is well-controlled.

**Children (Asthma):**

* **Ages 6-11 years:**  Typically, one inhalation (80 mcg) BID. The maximum daily dose is generally 320 mcg.
* **Ages 12 years and older:**  Typically, two inhalations (160 mcg) BID.  The maximum daily dose is generally 640 mcg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dose adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic or renal impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.  However, always inform your doctor about any kidney or liver conditions.


**Administration:**  Flunisolide is delivered via an MDI.  Always follow the instructions provided with your inhaler regarding priming, shaking, and correct inhaler technique. Rinsing the mouth with water after each dose is recommended to reduce the risk of oral thrush (candidiasis).

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include headache, pharyngitis (sore throat), and rhinitis (runny nose).

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* **Endocrine:** Adrenal suppression, growth retardation (in children), weight gain, and hypercorticism (excess cortisol).
* **Ophthalmic:** Cataracts, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure.
* **Respiratory:** Bronchospasm (paradoxical bronchospasm, worsening of asthma), thrush (oral candidiasis).
* **Other:**  Headache, dizziness, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, skin rash, and bone loss.

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Flunisolide is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation in the airways. It does this by decreasing the production of inflammatory substances and suppressing the activity of immune cells involved in the allergic response that triggers asthma symptoms. By reducing inflammation, flunisolide helps to open the airways, making it easier to breathe.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Flunisolide is not for treating acute asthma attacks.
* **Interactions:**  Flunisolide may interact with other medications; inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.  Specific interactions are detailed in the product literature.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Flunisolide is a Category C medication in pregnancy.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using it if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Children:**  Close monitoring of growth is important in children using flunisolide.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be at increased risk for certain side effects, including bone loss.
* **Other:** Patients with cataracts or glaucoma should be monitored closely while using flunisolide.
