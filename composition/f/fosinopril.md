# Fosinopril
### Generic Name
Fosinopril

### Usage
Fosinopril is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), both mild to moderate and in cases of renovascular hypertension (high blood pressure caused by reduced blood flow to the kidneys, particularly in individuals with diabetes, kidney disease, or microalbuminuria—a sign of early kidney damage).  It's also used as an adjunctive therapy (meaning it's used alongside other medications) to manage heart failure.  In heart failure, it works to improve the heart's function and reduce the symptoms of the condition.  While not officially approved for this purpose, Fosinopril has been used off-label in the treatment of HIV-associated nephropathy (kidney disease related to HIV infection).


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Hypertension:** The usual starting dose is 10 mg once daily.  This can be increased over several weeks, as tolerated, to a maximum of 80 mg daily. The typical effective dose ranges from 20 to 40 mg daily.  It can be used alone or with a diuretic (water pill).

* **Heart Failure:** Treatment typically starts with 10 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 20-40 mg daily, but the maximum dose remains at 40 mg daily. If low blood pressure, dizziness upon standing, or kidney problems occur during dosage adjustment, the dose of any concurrent diuretic might need reduction.

* **HIV-associated nephropathy (off-label):**  A typical starting dose is 10 mg once daily.

**Children (aged 6 years and older):**

Dosage is determined by weight:

* **Children weighing ≤50 kg:** The initial dose is 0.1 mg/kg/day once daily.  This can be increased up to a maximum of 0.6 mg/kg/day, but not to exceed 40 mg/day.

* **Children weighing >50 kg:** The initial dose is 5-10 mg once daily (monotherapy).  The maximum dose remains 40 mg/day.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:** In individuals with moderate to severe kidney problems, the starting dose may be reduced to 5 mg once daily. Fosinopril is poorly removed by dialysis; therefore, supplemental doses aren't generally necessary.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's label doesn't provide specific dose adjustments for individuals with liver problems.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Non-cardiac chest pain
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)
* Palpitations
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Increased serum transaminase levels (liver enzymes)
* Musculoskeletal pain and weakness
* Increased serum creatinine level (indicator of kidney function)
* Cough
* Upper respiratory infection
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Anaphylactic reactions (severe allergic reactions)
* Neutropenia/agranulocytosis (low white blood cell count)
* Renal failure
* Cholestatic jaundice (a type of jaundice)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)

If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Fosinopril is a prodrug; this means it's converted in the body into its active form, fosinoprilat. Fosinoprilat inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is crucial in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), a hormonal system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. By inhibiting ACE, fosinoprilat prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor (substance that narrows blood vessels).  This leads to decreased blood pressure and reduced strain on the heart.  Additionally, it's believed that fosinoprilat may also affect the central nervous system to further reduce blood pressure.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fosinopril is contraindicated in individuals with a history of allergic reactions to fosinopril, other ACE inhibitors, or any components of the formulation. It's also contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema related to prior ACE inhibitor use, bilateral renal artery stenosis, and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Concurrent use with aliskiren (another blood pressure medication) is contraindicated in people with diabetes or impaired kidney function.

* **Interactions:** Fosinopril can interact with numerous medications, including other antihypertensives, diuretics, potassium supplements, NSAIDs, and certain other drugs. This can lead to increased risk of side effects such as low blood pressure or high potassium levels. Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Exercise caution in patients with liver impairment, volume depletion, electrolyte imbalances, renal artery stenosis, severe aortic stenosis, collagen vascular disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and those undergoing major surgery.  Monitor for hyperkalemia, angioedema, neutropenia, renal function changes, and hypotension.  Fosinopril is generally avoided in pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take fosinopril with food?** A: Fosinopril can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Simply take your next dose as scheduled.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking fosinopril?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while taking fosinopril, as it can increase the risk of low blood pressure.

* **Q: How should I store fosinopril?** A: Store fosinopril in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as directed on the product label.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking fosinopril suddenly?** A:  No, do not stop taking fosinopril abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.

* **Q:  Is fosinopril safe for pregnant women?** A:  No, fosinopril is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy due to the risk of fetal injury and death.
