# Fosinopril

**Generic Name:** Fosinopril Sodium

**Usage:**

Fosinopril is an ACE inhibitor (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) used to treat:

* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  It helps lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney disease.
* **Heart failure:** It helps improve the symptoms and survival rate in people with heart failure.
* **After a heart attack:** It can be used to reduce the risk of death and further heart problems after a heart attack.  It is often given in combination with other medications.
* **Diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease due to diabetes):** It helps slow the progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of fosinopril include:

* **Dizziness:** This is often mild and may subside with continued use.
* **Headache:** Can be mild to moderate in severity.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Dry cough:** This is a relatively common side effect of ACE inhibitors.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Diarrhea or constipation:** Changes in bowel habits.
* **Muscle cramps:** Pain or spasms in the muscles.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation or allergic reaction.

Serious, though less common, side effects include:

* **Angioedema:** Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat. This is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.
* **High potassium levels (hyperkalemia):** This can be dangerous, particularly for people with kidney problems.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** Especially when starting the medication or increasing the dose.
* **Kidney problems:** Worsening of existing kidney disease.
* **Liver problems:** Although rare.
* **Changes in blood cell counts:** This can lead to increased risk of infection.

This is not an exhaustive list of side effects.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more information.


**How it Works:**

Fosinopril works by blocking the action of an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).  ACE is involved in the production of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels and increases blood pressure. By blocking ACE, fosinopril reduces the amount of angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and lowering blood pressure.  This also reduces the workload on the heart.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take fosinopril with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.  Certain combinations can be dangerous.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking fosinopril?**  Excessive alcohol consumption can lower blood pressure and increase the risk of side effects. Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.
* **Can I stop taking fosinopril suddenly?**  No, you should not stop taking fosinopril suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can cause a rebound increase in blood pressure.
* **How long will it take to see results?** It may take several weeks to see the full benefits of fosinopril.
* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?** Signs of an allergic reaction include rash, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, and dizziness. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these.
