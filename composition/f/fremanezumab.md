# Fremanezumab
### Generic Name
Fremanezumab

### Usage
Fremanezumab is a prescription medication used to prevent migraine headaches in adults.  It's specifically designed for the *prophylactic* treatment of migraine, meaning it aims to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks rather than treating a headache once it has started.  While its primary use is in preventing migraine, it doesn't address other types of headaches.

### Dosage

**Adults (Migraine Prophylaxis):** Fremanezumab is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  There are two approved dosage regimens:

* **Monthly:** 225 mg given once a month.
* **Quarterly:** 675 mg given every three months. This is administered as three consecutive 225 mg injections.

When switching between these regimens, the first dose of the new schedule should be given on the next regularly scheduled injection date.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of fremanezumab have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor for personalized advice, especially if you have impaired liver or kidney function.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling, itching at the injection site)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Development of antibodies against fremanezumab

**Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions such as rash, itching, hives, difficulty breathing).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any signs of a severe allergic reaction.

It's important to note that not everyone experiences side effects, and the severity can vary.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Fremanezumab is a monoclonal antibody.  Monoclonal antibodies are designed to target specific molecules in the body. In this case, fremanezumab targets calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). CGRP is a protein involved in the transmission of pain signals associated with migraine headaches. By binding to CGRP and blocking its interaction with its receptor, fremanezumab helps prevent the activation of pain pathways in the brain, thus reducing the frequency and severity of migraine attacks.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Fremanezumab is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known serious hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to fremanezumab or any of its components.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Hypersensitivity:** There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, itching, hives, and more serious allergic reactions.
* **Cardiovascular Disease:**  Use with caution in patients with a history of significant cardiovascular disease, vascular ischemia (reduced blood flow to tissues), or thrombotic events (blood clots), such as stroke, transient ischemic attack (mini-stroke), deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism.  Your doctor will need to carefully assess the risks and benefits before prescribing fremanezumab in these cases.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of fremanezumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown. Discuss the potential risks and benefits with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
