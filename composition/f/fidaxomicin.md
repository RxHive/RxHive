# Fidaxomicin
### Generic Name
Fidaxomicin

### Usage
Fidaxomicin is an antibiotic specifically used to treat *Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDI).  CDI is a common infection of the intestines caused by the bacteria *Clostridioides difficile*. This bacteria produces toxins that lead to diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever.  Fidaxomicin is highly effective against *C. difficile* and is often preferred over other antibiotics in certain situations because of its lower rate of recurrence.  It's important to note that fidaxomicin is *not* used to treat other types of bacterial infections.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The standard adult dosage is 200 mg twice daily (BID) for ten days. This is typically administered orally as tablets.

**Children:**  Fidaxomicin is available as an oral suspension for children aged 6 months and older. The dosage is weight-based and administered twice daily for ten days.  The recommended dosage is as follows:

*   Weight 4 to <7 kg: 80 mg BID
*   Weight 7 to <9 kg: 120 mg BID
*   Weight 9 to <12.5 kg: 160 mg BID

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are generally not necessary for patients with impaired kidney or liver function, though this should be discussed with a healthcare professional.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions regarding dosage.

**Administration:** The oral suspension should be shaken well before each use. For the oral suspension, use the provided oral dosing syringe for accurate measurement.


### Side Effects

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Fidaxomicin is a bactericidal antibiotic that works by inhibiting the RNA polymerase of *C. difficile* bacteria.  RNA polymerase is an enzyme essential for bacterial protein synthesis. By inhibiting this enzyme, fidaxomicin prevents the bacteria from producing necessary proteins, ultimately leading to their death and resolving the infection.  Unlike some other antibiotics, fidaxomicin has minimal systemic absorption, meaning it primarily acts within the gut where *C. difficile* resides.

### Precautions

*   **Allergy:** Fidaxomicin is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to fidaxomicin or any of its components.  Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of macrolide antibiotic allergies.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Fidaxomicin is classified as Category B in pregnancy, meaning animal studies have not shown risk to the fetus, but there are no adequate human studies.  The decision to use fidaxomicin during breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, weighing the benefits of treatment against the potential risk to the infant.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Concurrent use with live cholera vaccines may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
*   **Other Considerations:** Fidaxomicin should only be used to treat CDI. It is not effective against other bacterial infections.
