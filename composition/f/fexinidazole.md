# Fexinidazole
### Generic Name
Fexinidazole

### Usage
Fexinidazole is an antimicrobial drug primarily used to treat human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness.  This disease is caused by the parasite *Trypanosoma brucei gambiense*. Fexinidazole is effective against both the first-stage (hemolymphatic) and second-stage (meningoencephalitic) forms of the disease in patients aged 6 years and older weighing at least 20 kg.  It's important to note that its efficacy is reduced in patients with severe second-stage HAT (characterized by a cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count exceeding 100 cells/µL), and should only be used in such cases when no other treatment options are available.

### Dosage

**Human African Trypanosomiasis (Sleeping Sickness):**  Dosage is determined by weight and administered orally.  The medication should be taken during or immediately after a main meal (at least 250 mL of solid food) within 30 minutes of eating.  The tablet must be swallowed whole.

* **Patients weighing 20 to <35 kg:** 1.2 g daily for 4 days, followed by 600 mg daily for 6 days (total 10-day course).
* **Patients weighing ≥35 kg:** 1.8 g daily for 4 days, followed by 1.2 g daily for 6 days (total 10-day course).

**Pediatric Dosage (≥6 years old, ≥20 kg):**

* **Children aged ≥6 years and adolescents weighing 20 to <35 kg:** 1200 mg daily for 4 days, followed by 600 mg daily for 6 days.
* **Children aged ≥6 years and adolescents weighing ≥35 kg:** 1800 mg daily for 4 days, followed by 1200 mg daily for 6 days.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Fexinidazole is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m².  Avoid use in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m².

### How it Works

Fexinidazole is a nitroimidazole derivative. It's believed to work by being activated by parasite enzymes (nitroreductases) within the *Trypanosoma brucei* parasite. This activation produces reactive molecules that damage the parasite's DNA and proteins, ultimately leading to its death. The exact mechanisms of action for fexinidazole and its metabolites (M1 and M2) against *Trypanosoma brucei* are still under investigation.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Fexinidazole is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to fexinidazole or other nitroimidazole drugs (e.g., metronidazole, tinidazole).
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Fexinidazole is contraindicated in patients with liver problems.
* **Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with reduced kidney function (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²).
* **QT Prolongation:** There is a risk of QT interval prolongation; avoid concomitant use with drugs that also prolong the QT interval.
* **Neuropsychiatric Effects:**  Fexinidazole can cause neuropsychiatric side effects. Patients should be monitored for mood changes and worsening psychiatric symptoms.
* **Neutropenia:**  Fexinidazole may cause a decrease in white blood cells (neutropenia). Monitor blood counts regularly.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  While treatment during pregnancy is recommended after the first trimester to reduce the risk of fetal transmission and maternal death,  the drug's excretion in breast milk is unknown; a careful benefit-risk assessment should be made.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Avoid concomitant use with numerous drugs due to potential interactions that affect the metabolism or efficacy of either fexinidazole or the interacting drugs.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance on potential interactions.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment and for at least 48 hours after completing the course.


### FAQs

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, resume normal dosing the following day.  However, specific guidelines exist for when a dose is missed depending on which day of the 10-day course it is. Consult your doctor or refer to the medication's information sheet.
* **Q: How should I store Fexinidazole?** A: Store according to the instructions provided by your healthcare professional or on the packaging. Typically, this will involve storing it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q:  Is Fexinidazole safe for everyone?** A: No, Fexinidazole has contraindications, including those with hypersensitivity to nitroimidazoles or hepatic impairment.  It's crucial to discuss your health history with a doctor before taking it.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Fexinidazole?** A: Long-term effects are not fully understood, requiring ongoing monitoring.
* **Q: Can I take other medications while on Fexinidazole?** A:  Many drug interactions exist. Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your doctor before starting treatment with Fexinidazole.
