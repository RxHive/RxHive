# Fam-Trastuzumab Deruxtecan
### Generic Name
Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan

### Usage

Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan is a targeted cancer therapy used to treat adults with certain types of HER2-positive cancer.  Its primary use is in patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have already received at least one other anti-HER2 therapy.  This includes those who developed recurrence during or within six months of completing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.  It's also approved for treating adults with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have previously received trastuzumab-based therapy.  While not officially approved for these conditions, it's also sometimes used off-label in treating metastatic HER2-expressing colorectal cancer and metastatic, relapsed/refractory, nonsquamous, HER2-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer.  The use in these latter conditions is based on ongoing research and should only be considered under the close supervision of an oncologist.


### Dosage

Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan is administered intravenously (IV).  The dosage varies depending on the type of cancer being treated:

* **HER2-positive breast cancer:** 5.4 mg/kg once every 3 weeks.
* **HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma:** 6.4 mg/kg once every 3 weeks.
* **Off-label uses (colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer):**  The dosage used off-label is typically 6.4 mg/kg once every 3 weeks.

Treatment continues until the cancer progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors like kidney or liver function and the severity of side effects.  It is crucial to follow the oncologist's instructions precisely.  The first infusion is generally given over 90 minutes, and subsequent infusions may be given over 30 minutes if the first infusion is well-tolerated.  Do not use this medication interchangeably with other similar medications.  It is essential to understand the dosage and administration specifics provided by your healthcare provider.  

The medication is not currently approved for use in children, and its safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric populations.  

### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Abdominal pain
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Nausea
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Vomiting
* Anemia
* Decreased neutrophils (a type of white blood cell)
* Decreased platelets
* Decreased white blood cell count
* Lymphocytopenia (low lymphocyte count)
* Increased liver enzyme levels
* Dry eye syndrome
* Cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Epistaxis (nosebleeds)
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Fever

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Left ventricular dysfunction (heart problems)
* Interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis (lung inflammation)
* Severe neutropenia (dangerously low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Infusion reactions
* Tumor hemorrhage

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). It works by targeting HER2, a protein found on the surface of certain cancer cells.  The "antibody" part of the drug binds to HER2, delivering the "drug" (deruxtecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor) directly into the cancer cell.  Deruxtecan then damages the cancer cell's DNA, ultimately leading to its death. This targeted approach minimizes damage to healthy cells.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to it or its components.
* **Drug interactions:** This medication may interact with other drugs, particularly those affecting the bone marrow (myelosuppressive agents) or the heart.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan can harm a developing fetus; effective contraception is essential during treatment and for several months afterward. Breastfeeding is not recommended during and for an extended period after treatment.
* **Liver and kidney function:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with impaired liver or kidney function.
* **Cardiac function:**  This medication can affect the heart.  Regular monitoring of heart function (e.g., left ventricular ejection fraction) is necessary.
* **Pulmonary toxicity:**  Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis is critical.
