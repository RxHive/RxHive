# Fenofibrate + Metformin

**Generic Name:** Fenofibrate and Metformin Hydrochloride (combination not currently available as a single pill in many countries.  It's typically prescribed as two separate medications.)

**Usage:**  This combination is used to treat type 2 diabetes, particularly in patients with high levels of triglycerides and/or cholesterol (dyslipidemia).  Doctors may prescribe fenofibrate and metformin together when lifestyle changes (diet, exercise) and metformin alone haven't sufficiently controlled blood sugar and/or lipid levels.  The prescription is tailored to the individual's needs and response to treatment.

**Side Effects:**  The side effects are a combination of those associated with each individual drug.  They can be mild to severe and vary from person to person.

* **Metformin:** Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, metallic taste, and bloating. Less common but more serious side effects include lactic acidosis (rare but serious), vitamin B12 deficiency, and decreased absorption of vitamin B12.
* **Fenofibrate:** Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and myalgia (muscle pain). Less common but more serious side effects include liver damage, gallstones, and rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown).

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects and their severity.


**How it Works:**

* **Metformin:** Improves insulin sensitivity, reduces hepatic glucose production (glucose made by the liver), and improves glucose uptake in muscle tissue.  This ultimately leads to lower blood sugar levels.
* **Fenofibrate:**  Belongs to a class of drugs called fibrates. It lowers triglycerides and raises HDL ("good") cholesterol levels.  It works by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-Î±), which regulates lipid metabolism.

The combination uses the strengths of both medications to comprehensively manage both blood glucose and lipid levels in type 2 diabetes.


**FAQs:**

* **Is this combination always better than taking each drug separately?**  Not necessarily.  The decision to prescribe a combination depends on individual patient needs and response to individual medications.  Taking both separately allows for precise dosage adjustments for each medication.

* **What are the interactions with other medications?**  Both metformin and fenofibrate can interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Are there any specific contraindications?** Yes, there are contraindications for both metformin (kidney disease, liver disease, heart failure, alcohol abuse) and fenofibrate (severe liver or kidney disease, gallstones).  Your doctor will assess your suitability for this treatment.

* **How often do I need blood tests?** Regular blood tests to monitor blood sugar, kidney function, liver function, and lipid levels are necessary when taking this medication combination.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate frequency.

* **Can I stop taking this medication abruptly?** No, you should never stop taking either metformin or fenofibrate abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can have negative consequences on your health.
