# Rotavirus Vaccine Live
### Generic Name
Rotavirus Vaccine Live

### Usage
Rotavirus Vaccine Live is a vaccine used to prevent rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants.  Rotavirus is a common virus that causes severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, particularly in young children.  There are two main types of the vaccine available: a monovalent vaccine (RV1) and a pentavalent vaccine (RV5).  RV1 protects against rotavirus types G1 and certain non-G1 types (G3, G4, and G9), while RV5 offers broader protection against G1, G2, G3, G4, and G9 types.  The vaccine's primary use is preventative; it doesn't treat existing rotavirus infections.

### Dosage

Rotavirus Vaccine Live is **not** indicated for adults.  Dosage for infants depends on the specific vaccine (RV1 or RV5) and the infant's age.  Always follow the healthcare provider's instructions.

* **RV1 (Monovalent):**  This is typically given as a two-dose series. The first dose is administered between 6 and 14 weeks and 6 days of age, with the second dose given at least 4 weeks later, completing the series by 24 weeks of age. Each dose is 1 mL given orally.

* **RV5 (Pentavalent):** This vaccine is given as a three-dose series.  The first dose is given between 6 and 12 weeks of age, with subsequent doses administered at intervals of 4-10 weeks, completing the series by 32 weeks of age. Each dose is 2 mL given orally.

**Important Note:**  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises completing the vaccine series with the same vaccine product whenever possible.  If a change is necessary, consult a healthcare provider.  The schedule may need adjustments for infants who begin the series later or have already experienced rotavirus infection.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of recipients):

* Irritability
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Otitis media (middle ear infection)
* Fussiness

Less common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of recipients):

* Flatulence
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Bronchospasm

Rare but serious side effects (reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports):

* Anaphylaxis
* Angioedema
* Severe gastroenteritis (especially in infants with severe combined immunodeficiency, SCID)
* Hematochezia (blood in stool)
* Immune thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Intussusception (bowel telescoping)
* Kawasaki disease
* Secondary infection (transmission of vaccine virus)
* Seizures
* Urticaria (hives)

If any adverse effects occur, especially severe ones, contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Rotavirus Vaccine Live is a live, attenuated (weakened) vaccine.  After oral administration, the weakened virus replicates in the infant's intestines, stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies against rotavirus.  These antibodies provide protection against future rotavirus infections. The level of protection varies depending on the serotypes covered by the specific vaccine used.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  The vaccine is contraindicated in infants with a history of intussusception, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), or hypersensitivity to the vaccine or its components. For RV1, additional contraindications include infants with uncorrected congenital malformations of the gastrointestinal tract that predispose to intussusception.

* **Warnings:** There is an increased risk of intussusception and other adverse events mentioned in the side effects section.  The vaccine should be used cautiously in infants with pre-existing gastrointestinal conditions.

* **Interactions:** Immunosuppressive therapies can reduce the vaccine's effectiveness.  While simultaneous administration with other vaccines is generally safe, consult a doctor to ensure there are no contraindications or potential interactions.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The vaccine is not indicated for use in women of reproductive age, but infants living with pregnant women can be vaccinated.  Breastfeeding is permitted while the infant is receiving the vaccine.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I give my child the vaccine if they have a mild cold?** A:  Generally, a mild illness shouldn't prevent vaccination. However, if your child is moderately or severely ill, it's best to postpone the vaccination until they recover.  Consult your healthcare provider.

* **Q: What should I do if my child vomits after receiving the vaccine?** A:  For RV1, a replacement dose may be given at the same visit if most of the dose was lost.  For RV5, a replacement dose is not necessary; continue the vaccination schedule.

* **Q: How is the vaccine stored?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by the manufacturer and your healthcare provider carefully, as improper storage can compromise the vaccine's efficacy.

* **Q:  Is the vaccine effective against all types of rotavirus?** A: No, the effectiveness varies depending on the vaccine type (RV1 or RV5).  RV5 offers broader protection compared to RV1.
