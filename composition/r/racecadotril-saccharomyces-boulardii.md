# Racecadotril + Saccharomyces boulardii

It's important to understand that there is **no commercially available generic combination drug of racecadotril and *Saccharomyces boulardii*.**  These are often used together *off-label* or in separate formulations due to their different mechanisms of action.  Information below reflects their individual properties and potential combined effects, but not a specifically approved and manufactured combination product.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using these medications, especially together.


**Generic Name:**

* **Racecadotril:** Racecadotril
* **Saccharomyces boulardii:**  *Saccharomyces boulardii* (a probiotic yeast, not a drug with a generic name in the same sense)

**Usage:**

* **Racecadotril:** Primarily used to treat acute diarrhea in adults and children over three years of age.  Its use is more common in Europe than in North America.
* **Saccharomyces boulardii:** Used to prevent and treat diarrhea, particularly antibiotic-associated diarrhea and traveler's diarrhea.  Also sometimes used for other gastrointestinal issues.

**Side Effects:**

* **Racecadotril:** Generally well-tolerated.  Rare side effects can include headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal pain.  Serious side effects are uncommon.
* **Saccharomyces boulardii:** Generally considered safe. Side effects are rare and mild, but can include gas, bloating, and rash.  Individuals with compromised immune systems should exercise caution.  There's a theoretical risk of fungemia (fungal infection in the blood) in severely immunocompromised patients, although this is extremely rare.


**How it Works:**

* **Racecadotril:**  It's an enkephalinase inhibitor.  Enkephalins are natural substances in the body that help regulate gut motility and fluid secretion. By inhibiting their breakdown, racecadotril reduces intestinal fluid secretion and helps to slow down bowel movements, thereby alleviating diarrhea.
* **Saccharomyces boulardii:** This probiotic yeast works through several mechanisms: it competes with harmful bacteria for nutrients and attachment sites in the gut, it helps restore the balance of the gut microbiome, and it may enhance the intestinal barrier function, preventing the passage of harmful substances.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take racecadotril and *Saccharomyces boulardii* together?** A: While they are often used together off-label, it's crucial to consult a doctor or pharmacist before doing so.  They can assess your individual needs and determine if this combination is appropriate and safe for you.  The potential benefits and risks need to be carefully considered.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A:  Racecadotril may interact with medications that affect the liver.  *Saccharomyces boulardii* may interact with certain immunosuppressants. A healthcare professional should be consulted to address potential interactions based on your specific medication profile.

* **Q:  Are these suitable for children?** A: Racecadotril is generally not recommended for children under three. *Saccharomyces boulardii* is considered safe for children but always consult a pediatrician before giving it to a child.

* **Q:  How long should I take them?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the severity and cause of the diarrhea.  Always follow your doctor's instructions on how long to take the medication.
