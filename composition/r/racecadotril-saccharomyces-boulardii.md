# Racecadotril + Saccharomyces boulardii
### Generic Name
Racecadotril + *Saccharomyces boulardii*

**Note:** This combination is not a standard, pre-approved fixed-dose combination in many regions.  The information below reflects the individual actions of racecadotril and *Saccharomyces boulardii* and their potential synergistic effects when used together, often under a physician's prescription and guidance.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using these medications, particularly in combination.

### Usage

This combination is often used to treat acute diarrhea, particularly diarrhea caused by infections. Let's look at each component individually:

* **Racecadotril:** This medication is an enkephalinase inhibitor. It works by reducing the activity of an enzyme that breaks down enkephalins, naturally occurring substances in the body that help regulate gut motility.  By inhibiting this enzyme, racecadotril helps reduce bowel contractions, slowing down the passage of stool and thereby reducing the frequency and severity of diarrhea. It's primarily used for acute diarrhea, especially infectious diarrhea in adults and children.

* **Saccharomyces boulardii:** This is a non-pathogenic yeast. It acts as a probiotic, meaning it helps restore the balance of beneficial bacteria in the gut.  *S. boulardii* helps to compete with harmful bacteria, reduces inflammation in the gut lining, and may improve the immune response in the gut. It's often used to treat various gastrointestinal issues, including diarrhea, particularly antibiotic-associated diarrhea and traveler's diarrhea.

The combined use of racecadotril and *Saccharomyces boulardii* aims to achieve a synergistic effect: racecadotril reduces the frequency and urgency of bowel movements while *S. boulardii* works to restore gut flora and potentially prevent recurrence.


### Dosage

Dosage for racecadotril and *Saccharomyces boulardii* varies depending on the specific product, the patient's age, and the severity of their condition.  **Always follow the directions provided by your healthcare professional or the product packaging.**  There isn't a standardized combination dosage, and the components are often prescribed separately or in formulations where each component has its own recommended dose.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose of each for your specific needs.


### Side Effects

**Racecadotril:**

* Common:  Nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, flatulence.
* Less Common but Serious:  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling),  severe constipation.

**Saccharomyces boulardii:**

* Common:  Generally well-tolerated. Some individuals might experience mild abdominal bloating or gas.
* Less Common but Serious:  Though rare, allergic reactions are possible in individuals with yeast sensitivities or compromised immune systems.  *S. boulardii* should be avoided by individuals with central venous catheters.

**Combined Use:** The side effects when taking both medications together may be additive. It's crucial to report any side effects to your doctor.

### How it Works

As described in the "Usage" section, racecadotril acts on the gut's nervous system, while *Saccharomyces boulardii* works by modifying the gut's microbiome. Their combined action aims to treat diarrhea from multiple angles.


### Precautions

* **Racecadotril:**  Not recommended for individuals with severe kidney problems.  Use with caution in patients with liver disease.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding require careful consideration and physician guidance.
* **Saccharomyces boulardii:** Should be avoided in individuals with severely compromised immune systems (e.g., those with AIDS or undergoing chemotherapy) as it might cause fungemia (yeast infection in the blood).  Individuals allergic to yeast should avoid its use.  It's generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but it's still best to consult with a healthcare professional.

Both medications can interact with other drugs. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
