# Reserpine
### Generic Name
Reserpine

### Usage
Reserpine is primarily used to treat mild to moderate hypertension (high blood pressure) and certain types of psychoses.  Its primary mechanism involves lowering blood pressure by depleting the body's stores of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that raises blood pressure. In psychoses, its exact mechanism is less clear, but it's thought to affect neurotransmitter levels in the brain, leading to a calming effect.  While its use in hypertension has largely been superseded by newer, safer medications, it may still be considered in specific situations under close medical supervision.  It is rarely prescribed for psychoses now, due to the availability of more effective and safer alternatives.

### Dosage

**Hypertension (Adults):**  Treatment typically begins with a low dose (up to 500 mcg/day) for one to two weeks.  The dose is then gradually reduced to the lowest effective amount, usually between 100-250 mcg/day. The maximum recommended daily dose is 500 mcg.

**Psychoses (Adults):** Oral administration starts at 0.5 mg/day, with the usual dose ranging from 0.1 mg to 1 mg/day.  Dosage adjustments are made based on individual response, under strict medical supervision.

**Hypertension (Children):** The oral dose is 0.02 mg/kg/day, divided into one or two doses.  The maximum daily dose is 0.25 mg.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, some alternative recommendations suggest avoiding reserpine in patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of less than 10 mL/min.  Reserpine isn't removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.  Always consult with a healthcare professional for appropriate dosage in patients with impaired organ function.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

*   Drowsiness
*   Dizziness
*   Headache
*   Nasal congestion
*   Nausea
*   Diarrhea
*   Depression
*   Anxiety (paradoxically)
*   Weight gain


Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

*   Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
*   Hypotension (low blood pressure)
*   Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
*   Parkinson-like symptoms
*   Blood disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia)
*   Gastrointestinal ulcers

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed above, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Reserpine works by inhibiting the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT). This transporter is responsible for moving neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine into storage vesicles within nerve cells. By blocking VMAT, reserpine prevents these neurotransmitters from being stored, leading to their depletion. This depletion results in decreased sympathetic nervous system activity, which translates to lowered blood pressure.  In the brain, this neurotransmitter depletion is believed to contribute to its effect on psychosis, though the exact mechanism is complex and not fully understood.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Reserpine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, those receiving electroconvulsive therapy, those with active peptic ulcers, ulcerative colitis, and those with a history of or active depression, especially with suicidal tendencies.  It's also contraindicated with iobenguane and tetrabenazine.

*   **Interactions:** Reserpine can interact with numerous medications, including other antihypertensives, MAO inhibitors, CNS depressants, and others.  This can lead to enhanced hypotensive effects or other adverse reactions.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Reserpine is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its risks haven't been fully established.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so its use during breastfeeding is not recommended.

*   **Specific Populations:** Caution is advised in patients with asthma, gallstones, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, renal impairment, pheochromocytoma, and Parkinson's disease.  Elderly patients and those with pre-existing conditions may require careful monitoring and lower doses.

### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I stop taking reserpine suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping reserpine can lead to rebound hypertension,  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

*   **Q: How should I store reserpine?** A: Store reserpine as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, skip it and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not double the dose.

*   **Q: Is reserpine habit-forming?** A: Reserpine is not considered habit-forming in the same way as opioids or other substances of abuse, however, dependence can arise from a need for it to control blood pressure or symptoms of psychosis.

*   **Q:  Is reserpine safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use of reserpine is generally not recommended due to the risk of side effects and the availability of safer alternatives for hypertension management.  It's primarily used only for short periods under close medical supervision.
