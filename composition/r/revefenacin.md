# Revefenacin
### Generic Name
Revefenacin

### Usage
Revefenacin is a long-acting anticholinergic medication primarily used for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's crucial to understand that Revefenacin is *not* intended for immediate relief of acute bronchospasm or for managing rapidly worsening or life-threatening COPD episodes.  Instead, it's designed to provide ongoing, preventative bronchodilation to improve lung function and reduce symptoms in patients with stable COPD.


### Dosage
**Adults (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease):** The recommended dose is 175 mcg (one unit-dose vial) administered once daily via oral inhalation using a standard jet nebulizer with a mouthpiece connected to an air compressor.  Do not use with non-compressor-based nebulizers as safety and efficacy haven't been established.  The solution should not be injected or swallowed. Each single-use vial should be discarded after use.

**Children:** Revefenacin is not approved for use in children; safety and effectiveness have not been established in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are needed for patients with renal impairment.  However, Revefenacin is not recommended for use in patients with hepatic impairment.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Back pain
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and pharynx)
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Bronchitis
* Oropharyngeal pain (pain in the mouth and throat)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of airway narrowing) â€“ seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* Other serious side effects are possible, though rare; consult a doctor if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.


### How it Works
Revefenacin is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, also known as an anticholinergic.  It works by blocking the M3 receptors in the airway smooth muscles of the lungs. This blockage prevents the effects of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that causes airway constriction. By inhibiting this constriction, Revefenacin helps to relax the airways, resulting in bronchodilation (widening of the airways) and improved airflow.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Revefenacin should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to Revefenacin or any of its components.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Paradoxical Bronchospasm:**  There's a risk of paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of airway narrowing), which requires immediate medical attention.
* **Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects:** Dizziness and blurred vision are possible.
* **Urinary Retention:** Revefenacin may worsen urinary retention, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions like prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate).
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Use is not recommended in patients with liver problems.
* **Narrow-Angle Glaucoma:**  Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Monitor for signs of immediate hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Other Medications:**  Discuss all medications you are currently taking with your doctor before starting Revefenacin, especially other anticholinergics or OATP1B1/OATP1B3 inhibitors (like rifampicin and cyclosporine). Concomitant use could increase side effects.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety and efficacy of Revefenacin during pregnancy haven't been established.  It's unknown whether it's excreted in breast milk, so discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using it while breastfeeding.
