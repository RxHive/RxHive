# Rifaximin
### Generic Name
Rifaximin

### Usage
Rifaximin is a non-systemic antibiotic, meaning it primarily affects bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and doesn't significantly enter the bloodstream.  Its main use is in reducing the risk of hepatic encephalopathy (a complication of liver disease) recurring in adults.  It's also used to treat moderate-to-severe irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with diarrhea in adults, and travelers' diarrhea caused by non-invasive strains of *Escherichia coli* in adults and children aged 12 and older.  Importantly,  it's often used off-label for other conditions, such as recurrent *Clostridioides difficile* infection and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), but these uses aren't officially approved by regulatory bodies in all regions.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's age.  Always follow your doctor's prescription.  

**Adults:**

* **Hepatic encephalopathy:**  550 mg twice daily or 400 mg three times daily.
* **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) with diarrhea:** 550 mg three times daily for 14 days.
* **Traveler's diarrhea (treatment):** 200 mg three times daily for three days.
* **Traveler's diarrhea (prophylaxis - off-label):** 200 mg once to three times daily for three days.  (Note: This is typically only for short trips and high-risk individuals).
* **Recurrent *Clostridioides difficile* infection (off-label):** 400 mg three times daily for 20 days (usually after a course of vancomycin).
* **Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) (off-label):** 550 mg three times daily for 14 days.

**Children:**  Dosage for children varies greatly by age and condition and should be determined by a healthcare professional.  Rifaximin is sometimes used to treat traveler's diarrhea in children aged 3-11 years and recurrent *C. difficile* infection in children under 12, but specific dosage will be determined by a doctor based on weight.


Rifaximin is typically administered orally in tablet form.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include dizziness, fatigue, nausea, peripheral edema (swelling), ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen). Less common but potentially serious side effects include headache, depression, skin rash, abdominal pain, pseudomembranous colitis (a severe intestinal infection), and allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema).  Rare, but serious side effects such as *Clostridioides difficile* associated diarrhea are also possible.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Rifaximin works by binding to bacterial RNA polymerase, an enzyme essential for bacterial protein synthesis. This inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis and prevents bacterial growth.  In hepatic encephalopathy, it reduces the number of ammonia-producing bacteria in the gut, indirectly lowering ammonia levels in the blood, improving the patient's condition.

### Precautions
Rifaximin is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to rifaximin or other rifamycin antibiotics.  It should be used cautiously in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  While generally considered safe, there is limited data on its use in pregnant and breastfeeding women.  The drug may interact with other medications; discuss all current medications with your doctor before starting rifaximin.  The potential for bacterial superinfections should also be considered.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take rifaximin with food?** A: Rifaximin can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store rifaximin?** A: Store rifaximin as directed on the label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Is rifaximin effective against systemic infections?** A: No, rifaximin is not effective against systemic infections because only a small amount is absorbed into the bloodstream.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q:  Can rifaximin treat all types of diarrhea?** A: No, it is primarily effective against diarrhea caused by specific bacteria. If your diarrhea is severe, bloody, or accompanied by a fever, seek immediate medical attention.
