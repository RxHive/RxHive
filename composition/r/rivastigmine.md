# Rivastigmine

**Generic Name:** Rivastigmine

**Usage:** Rivastigmine is used to treat the symptoms of mild, moderate, and severe Alzheimer's disease and dementia associated with Parkinson's disease.  It is prescribed to improve cognitive function (memory, thinking, reasoning) and daily functioning in patients with these conditions.  It is available in oral capsule and oral solution forms.  Dosage is individualized and gradually increased by the prescribing physician.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite.  These are often dose-related and may improve with slower titration of the dose or taking the medication with food.
* **Neurological:** Dizziness, headache, fainting, tremors, syncope (brief loss of consciousness).
* **Other:**  Fatigue, weight loss, increased sweating, bradycardia (slow heart rate).  More serious, but less common side effects include:  serious heart problems, liver problems, and severe gastrointestinal bleeding.

It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult the medication's package insert or your doctor for a complete list of potential side effects.


**How it Works:** Rivastigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor.  Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter crucial for memory and cognitive function. In Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease-related dementia, the brain produces less acetylcholine. Rivastigmine works by blocking the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down acetylcholine. By inhibiting this enzyme, rivastigmine increases the levels of acetylcholine in the brain, thereby potentially improving cognitive function and reducing symptoms of dementia.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I stop taking rivastigmine suddenly?** A: No.  Always consult your doctor before stopping rivastigmine.  Sudden cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  The dose should be gradually reduced under medical supervision.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking rivastigmine?** A:  Alcohol can worsen some of the side effects of rivastigmine, particularly nausea and dizziness. It's best to limit or avoid alcohol while taking this medication.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Q:  Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, rivastigmine can interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Q:  How effective is rivastigmine?** A:  The effectiveness of rivastigmine varies from person to person. While it may help improve cognitive function and daily living skills for some individuals, it doesn't cure Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease-related dementia and its effects may lessen over time.

* **Q: What are the signs of an allergic reaction?** A: Signs of an allergic reaction can include rash, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing. If you experience any of these, seek immediate medical attention.
