# Radium-223 Dichloride
### Generic Name
Radium-223 Dichloride

### Usage
Radium-223 dichloride is a radioactive medication specifically used to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer.  It's targeted at patients whose cancer has spread to the bones (bone metastases) and whose visceral metastases are either unknown or not causing symptoms.  This medication is not used to treat prostate cancer that hasn't spread to the bones or for other types of cancer.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical adult dose is 50 kBq/kg (1.49 microcurie/kg) given intravenously every four weeks for a total of six doses.  The exact amount administered will be carefully calculated based on the patient's weight and the radioactive strength of the specific batch of medicine using a dose calibrator.  Healthcare professionals must follow precise instructions for handling and calculating the dose to ensure safe and effective administration.  Before the first dose, the patient's blood counts (ANC, platelets, and hemoglobin) must meet specific criteria.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of radium-223 dichloride in children haven't been established, therefore, it is not used in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are generally needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment. For moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and for renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/minute), there's insufficient data to provide specific dosage adjustments according to the manufacturer's labeling. However, because the drug isn't significantly metabolized by the liver or eliminated in bile, adjustment is unlikely to be necessary.  If a patient experiences significant bone marrow suppression (low blood cell counts), the treatment may need to be temporarily halted or stopped altogether.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Lymphocytopenia (low lymphocyte count)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include:
* Dehydration
* Pancytopenia (low counts of all blood cells)
* Injection site reactions
* Renal failure or insufficiency
* Aplastic anemia (very rare, but life-threatening)

If you experience any side effects, especially severe ones, it's crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Radium-223 dichloride is a radioactive substance that emits alpha particles. These particles target and destroy cancer cells in the bones.  Because radium-223 behaves similarly to calcium, it's attracted to areas of high bone turnover, which are often associated with bone metastases from prostate cancer.  This targeted delivery helps minimize damage to healthy tissues while effectively treating the cancerous bone lesions.

### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Radium-223 dichloride is classified as Category X, meaning it's contraindicated in pregnancy.  Breastfeeding is also not recommended during treatment.
* **Bone Marrow Suppression:** This medication can suppress bone marrow function, leading to low blood cell counts. Regular blood tests are essential to monitor this.
* **Dehydration:** Dehydration is a potential risk, and adequate fluid intake is crucial.
* **Other Medications:** While not explicitly contraindicated with all medications, concurrent use of chemotherapy or other systemic radioisotopes/external radiotherapy should be carefully considered and is generally not recommended unless under specific clinical trial settings due to the potential for additive bone marrow toxicity.  If other treatments become necessary, Radium-223 should be discontinued.
* **Fertility:** Male patients should use condoms and female partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and for 6 months after completing the treatment.

### FAQs
* **Q: How is radium-223 dichloride administered?**
    *A: It's given intravenously (IV) as a slow injection.

* **Q: How long does treatment last?**
    *A: Typically six doses are given every four weeks.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
    *A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately.  Do not attempt to adjust the dosage yourself.

* **Q: How is the medication stored?**
    *A: It's a radioactive substance; its storage and handling require strict adherence to guidelines specified by healthcare professionals.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?**
    *A:  Long-term effects are a possibility, and monitoring after treatment completion is important.  Discuss this with your oncologist.

* **Q:  Can I drive while taking this medication?**
   *A: Consult your doctor.  Side effects such as nausea, vomiting, or dizziness might impair your ability to drive safely.
