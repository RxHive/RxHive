# Rupatadine + Montelukast
### Generic Name
Rupatadine + Montelukast

### Usage

Rupatadine + Montelukast is a combination medication used to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and chronic urticaria (hives).  It combines two active ingredients: rupatadine and montelukast.  Rupatadine is an antihistamine that works to block the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, thus reducing symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist; it blocks leukotrienes, another group of inflammatory substances involved in allergic reactions. By blocking both histamine and leukotrienes, this combination medication provides broader and more effective relief from allergy symptoms than either drug alone. While primarily used for allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria, its effectiveness might vary from person to person, depending on the severity and underlying cause of their allergic symptoms.  Always consult with a doctor to determine if this medication is suitable for your specific condition.

### Dosage

Dosage recommendations for Rupatadine + Montelukast vary depending on the specific formulation and the patient's age and condition.  Always follow the prescribing physician's instructions meticulously.  There is no standard IV formulation for this combination drug; it's typically administered orally.  Information below is for general guidance only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

* **Adults and Adolescents (12 years and older):** The usual dose is one tablet once daily, typically taken in the evening.  The exact dose and frequency will be determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and response to the medication.

* **Children (under 12 years):** This combination medication is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age.  Separate formulations of rupatadine and montelukast are available for pediatric use, with dosages adjusted according to the child's weight and age.  Always consult a pediatrician before administering any medication to a child.

**Important Note:**  Never exceed the recommended dose.  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

### How it Works

Rupatadine, the antihistamine component, blocks H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and triggering allergic responses.  Histamine is released during allergic reactions and causes inflammation, itching, sneezing, and other symptoms. Montelukast, the leukotriene receptor antagonist, blocks leukotriene receptors, preventing leukotrienes from triggering inflammation in the airways and other parts of the body.  Leukotrienes contribute significantly to the inflammation and bronchoconstriction associated with allergies. By targeting both histamine and leukotrienes, this combination therapy offers a comprehensive approach to alleviating allergy symptoms.
