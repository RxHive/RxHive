# Rimexolone
### Generic Name
Rimexolone

### Usage

Rimexolone is a corticosteroid eye drop primarily used to treat inflammation in the eye.  Its main uses are:

* **Postoperative inflammation following ocular surgery:** Rimexolone helps reduce swelling and discomfort after eye surgery.  It's applied to the affected eye to minimize inflammation and promote healing.

* **Anterior uveitis:** This is a type of eye inflammation affecting the middle layer of the eye (uvea). Rimexolone helps reduce the inflammation and associated symptoms like pain, redness, and blurred vision.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Postoperative ocular inflammation:** 1-2 drops of the 1% ophthalmic suspension are applied to the affected eye four times a day (QID). Treatment usually continues for two weeks post-surgery, starting 24 hours after the procedure.

* **Anterior uveitis:**  The dosage for anterior uveitis is more intensive initially.  It begins with 1-2 drops of the 1% ophthalmic suspension into the affected eye(s) every hour during waking hours for the first week.  This is then reduced to one drop every two hours during waking hours for the second week, and subsequently tapered off as the inflammation resolves.  The tapering schedule should be determined by a physician based on the patient's response.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and efficacy of Rimexolone haven't been established in children under 18 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

No dosage adjustments are specified in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before using Rimexolone if you have any liver or kidney conditions.

### Side Effects

* Increased intraocular pressure
* Blurred vision

**Less Common Side Effects (<2%):**

* Sore throat (pharyngitis)
* Runny nose (rhinitis)
* Altered taste (dysgeusia)


**Rare Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Conjunctival edema (swelling of the conjunctiva)
* Corneal edema (swelling of the cornea)
* Corneal erosion (damage to the surface of the cornea)
* Anterior chamber fibrin deposition
* Brow ache
* Corneal staining and ulceration
* Dry eye
* Corneal infiltrate (inflammatory cells in the cornea)
* Corneal irritation
* Keratitis (inflammation of the cornea)
* Lid crusting
* Sensitivity to light (photophobia)
* Ocular edema (swelling of the eye)
* Sticky sensation in the eye
* Tearing

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (Frequency not defined):**

* Cataracts
* Optic nerve damage

* Secondary eye infections


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Rimexolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist.  This means it works by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the eye. This binding triggers a series of events that suppress the body's inflammatory response.  Specifically, it reduces swelling, decreases the infiltration of inflammatory cells, lessens capillary dilation, inhibits the formation of scar tissue, and slows down collagen deposition â€“ all processes contributing to eye inflammation.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Rimexolone is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Viral infections of the cornea and conjunctiva (such as herpes simplex keratitis, vaccinia, and varicella)
* Mycobacterial eye infection
* Fungal infections of the eye
* Acute, untreated purulent (pus-producing) eye infections
* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Rimexolone or similar corticosteroids


**Warnings:**  Increased risk of the following with prolonged use:

* Glaucoma (with potential damage to the optic nerve, visual acuity problems, and cataract formation)
* Secondary eye infections
* Immunosuppression (increasing susceptibility to infections)
* Corneal thinning (potentially leading to perforation)
* Cataracts

**Use with Caution:**

* In patients with a history of herpes simplex eye infections.
* In patients with conditions causing thinning of the eye tissues (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Fuchs' dystrophy, or after corneal transplant).


**Drug Interactions:** Rimexolone may interact with other medications.  Consult your doctor about any other medications you are taking, especially: aldesleukin, ceritinib, corticorelin, deferasirox, hyaluronidase, and ophthalmic NSAIDs.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Rimexolone is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Its effects on pregnancy are unknown.  Excretion in breast milk is also uncertain, so caution is advised if using this medication during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long should I use Rimexolone?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the condition being treated and your individual response.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment length.

* **Q: Can I use Rimexolone with contact lenses?** A: Remove contact lenses before applying Rimexolone and wait at least 10 minutes before reinserting them.
