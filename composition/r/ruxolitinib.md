# Ruxolitinib
### Generic Name
Ruxolitinib

### Usage
Ruxolitinib is a medication primarily used to treat certain blood cancers and related conditions.  Its main applications are:

* **Myelofibrosis:** This is a rare bone marrow disorder where scar tissue replaces healthy bone marrow. Ruxolitinib helps reduce the size of the spleen (often enlarged in myelofibrosis), alleviate symptoms like fatigue, night sweats, and bone pain, and improve overall quality of life.  This applies to primary myelofibrosis, and myelofibrosis secondary to polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.

* **Polycythemia Vera:** This is another myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by an overproduction of red blood cells. Ruxolitinib is used in adults who haven't responded well to or can't tolerate hydroxyurea, a standard treatment.  It helps manage symptoms and reduce the risk of complications.

* **Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD):** This is a serious complication that can occur after a stem cell transplant. Ruxolitinib is used to treat both acute (aGvHD) and chronic (cGvHD) forms, particularly in cases where other treatments haven't been successful.  For aGvHD, it's used in adults and children aged 12 and older who are steroid-refractory (meaning steroids haven't worked).  For cGvHD, it's used after one or two lines of systemic therapy have failed in adults and children 12 years and older.


### Dosage

Ruxolitinib dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, and response to therapy.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  The following information is for general understanding only and should not be used for self-medication.

**Myelofibrosis (Oral):**  The starting dose depends on the platelet count:

* Platelet count >200,000/mm³: 20 mg twice daily (BID)
* Platelet count 100,000-200,000/mm³: 15 mg BID
* Platelet count 50,000-<100,000/mm³: 5 mg BID

Dosage adjustments are made based on the patient's response and blood counts.  The dose may be increased or decreased under medical supervision.

**Polycythemia Vera (Oral):** The initial dose is typically 10 mg BID.  Dose adjustments are similar to myelofibrosis, based on response and blood counts.

**Acute GvHD (Oral):**

* Adults and children ≥12 years: Initial dose is 5 mg BID.  The dose may be increased to 10 mg BID after at least 3 days if certain blood counts remain adequate.
* Weight-based dosing for children and adolescents:  
    * <25 kg: 2.5 mg BID initially, potentially doubled weekly up to 10 mg BID.
    * ≥25 kg: 5 mg BID initially, potentially doubled weekly up to 10 mg BID.


**Chronic GvHD (Oral):** The starting dose is typically 10 mg BID for adults and children ≥12 years.

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  These adjustments are complex and should be determined by a healthcare provider, taking into account factors like the severity of the impairment and the specific condition being treated.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Insomnia
* Diarrhea
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Bruising
* Increased cholesterol and triglycerides
* Anemia
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)
* Increased liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
* Muscle spasms

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Hypertension
* Serious infections
* Skin cancers (basal cell, squamous cell, Merkel cell carcinoma)
* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) – a rare and serious brain infection
* Exacerbation of hepatitis B
* Tuberculosis
* Increased risk of secondary malignancies.


If any side effects occur, especially if they are severe or persistent, it's vital to contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor.  JAKs are enzymes that play a crucial role in cell signaling pathways involved in inflammation and blood cell production. In myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, abnormal JAK activity contributes to the disease process. Ruxolitinib by inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2, reduces abnormal blood cell production and alleviates symptoms. In GvHD,  Ruxolitinib's action on JAK-STAT signaling pathways helps to suppress the immune response that causes the damage to the body.


### Precautions

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Ruxolitinib dosage requires careful adjustment in patients with liver or kidney problems.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ruxolitinib's metabolism can be affected by other medications, particularly strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.  A healthcare provider should be informed of all medications being taken.
* **Infections:**  Ruxolitinib can increase the risk of infections.  Patients should report any signs of infection promptly.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ruxolitinib should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential harm to the developing fetus or infant.
* **Cancer Risk:** There is an increased risk of certain cancers, including skin cancers and lymphoma. Regular skin exams and monitoring are recommended.
* **Cardiovascular Events:**  There is an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.  Patients with pre-existing heart conditions need close monitoring.
* **Bleeding:**  Because of the potential for thrombocytopenia, close monitoring for bleeding is necessary.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Ruxolitinib with food?** A: Yes, it can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a double dose. Simply resume your regular dosing schedule.
* **Q: How should I store Ruxolitinib?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Ruxolitinib?** A: No, grapefruit juice can interfere with the medication's metabolism and should be avoided.
* **Q:  How long will I need to take Ruxolitinib?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the condition and response to therapy.  This is determined by your healthcare provider.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Ruxolitinib?** A: Long-term effects can include an increased risk of infections, skin cancers, and other malignancies. Regular monitoring is important.
