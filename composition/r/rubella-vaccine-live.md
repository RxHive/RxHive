# Rubella vaccine Live
### Generic Name
Rubella Vaccine Live

### Usage
The Rubella vaccine is primarily used to prevent rubella, also known as German measles.  This is a viral infection that can cause a mild rash and fever in most people, but it poses a significant risk to pregnant women.  Infection during pregnancy can lead to serious birth defects in the developing fetus, including congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which can cause hearing loss, heart defects, eye problems, intellectual disability, and liver or spleen damage.  The vaccine is part of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) combination vaccine, which is routinely given to children to protect them against all three diseases.  While primarily used for preventing rubella in children, it's also used in adolescents and adults who haven't been vaccinated previously or haven't developed immunity.


### Dosage
The Rubella vaccine, typically administered as part of the MMR vaccine, is usually given as a single subcutaneous injection.

* **Children:**  The standard dose is one dose of MMR vaccine, typically given at 12-15 months of age, with a second dose given at 4-6 years of age.  The specific age recommendations may vary slightly depending on the country and local guidelines.
* **Adults:**  Adults who lack immunity to rubella should receive one dose of the MMR vaccine.  Two doses may be recommended for adults in certain situations, such as healthcare workers or those planning to become pregnant.  Pregnant women should *not* receive the rubella vaccine.
* **Oral/IV Administration:** The rubella vaccine is not administered orally or intravenously. It is always given as a subcutaneous injection.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and temporary:

* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site
* Mild fever
* Rash
* Joint pain (more common in adults)
* Headache
* Fatigue

Serious side effects are rare but can include:

* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.


### How it Works
The rubella vaccine contains a live, attenuated (weakened) strain of the rubella virus.  When injected, this weakened virus triggers an immune response in the body. The body produces antibodies that fight off the weakened virus.  These antibodies then provide long-lasting immunity against future infection with the wild-type (natural) rubella virus. This immunity protects against getting rubella and the potential complications it can cause.


### Precautions
* **Pregnancy:** The rubella vaccine is contraindicated (should not be given) during pregnancy because the live attenuated virus, though weakened, could theoretically harm the developing fetus.  Women should avoid pregnancy for at least one month after receiving the MMR vaccine.
* **Immunodeficiency:** Individuals with severely compromised immune systems should not receive the live attenuated rubella vaccine due to the risk of infection.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Anyone with a known severe allergy to any component of the vaccine (e.g., neomycin, gelatin) should not receive it.
* **Interactions:** The rubella vaccine may interact with certain medications, particularly those that suppress the immune system. Discuss any medications you are taking with your doctor before receiving the vaccine.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does the immunity last after vaccination?** A:  The immunity provided by the rubella vaccine is typically long-lasting, often providing lifelong protection.  However, some individuals may require a booster dose later in life, especially healthcare workers.

* **Q: Can I get rubella from the vaccine?** A: It's extremely rare to develop rubella from the vaccine due to the use of a weakened virus. However, mild symptoms, mimicking a very mild case of rubella, are possible.

* **Q: How should I store the vaccine?** A:  The vaccine must be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually in a refrigerator at a specific temperature to maintain its efficacy.

* **Q: What should I do if I think I've had a reaction to the vaccine?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning symptoms after receiving the rubella vaccine.
