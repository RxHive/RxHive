# Rubella vaccine Live

**Generic Name:** Rubella Virus Vaccine, Live

**Usage:**  The Rubella virus vaccine, live, is used to prevent rubella (German measles), a viral infection that can cause mild illness but can lead to serious complications, especially in pregnant women.  It is typically administered as part of a combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, but can also be given as a single-antigen rubella vaccine.  The vaccine is recommended for children and adults who haven't had rubella or haven't been vaccinated.  Specific scheduling varies by country and individual health recommendations.


**Side Effects:**  Most side effects are mild and temporary. These can include:

* **Common:** Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site; fever; rash; headache; mild joint pain (especially in adult women).
* **Rare but more serious:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), though extremely rare.  These require immediate medical attention.  Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is also a very rare side effect.


**How it Works:** The Rubella Virus Vaccine, Live, contains a weakened (attenuated) form of the rubella virus.  After vaccination, the weakened virus replicates in the body, triggering an immune response. This immune response produces antibodies that protect against future infection by the wild-type rubella virus.  This immunity is typically long-lasting, providing protection for many years, possibly a lifetime.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is the live rubella vaccine safe for pregnant women?** A: No.  Pregnant women should *not* receive the live rubella vaccine.  The vaccine should be avoided for at least one month following vaccination before attempting pregnancy.  Women should discuss vaccination plans with their doctors well in advance of considering pregnancy.
* **Q: Can I get rubella from the vaccine?** A:  It's possible to experience a very mild, temporary form of rubella after vaccination, but it will not be as severe as a natural infection and is far less likely to cause complications. The weakened virus in the vaccine is not strong enough to cause serious illness.
* **Q:  What if I've already had rubella?** A:  If you've already had rubella, you likely already have immunity and don't need the vaccine.  A blood test can confirm immunity.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience a severe reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe allergic reactions such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or a widespread rash.
* **Q: Is the vaccine effective?** A:  The rubella vaccine is highly effective in preventing rubella infection.  However, like all vaccines, it's not 100% effective.  This means a small percentage of vaccinated individuals might still get rubella, though usually in a much milder form.
