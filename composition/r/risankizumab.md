# Risankizumab
### Generic Name
Risankizumab

### Usage

Risankizumab is a medication used to treat several inflammatory conditions.  Its primary use is in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who haven't responded well to, or aren't suitable for, other treatments like systemic therapy or phototherapy.  Importantly, it's also approved for treating active psoriatic arthritis and moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in adults.  These conditions share an underlying inflammatory process, making Risankizumab effective across them.

### Dosage

Risankizumab is administered either subcutaneously (under the skin) or intravenously (into a vein), depending on the condition being treated.  Dosage varies significantly based on the specific disease:


* **Plaque Psoriasis:**  The typical subcutaneous dose is 150 mg at weeks 0 and 4, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter.

* **Crohn's Disease:**  This requires a more intensive initial phase.  Intravenous administration of 600 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8 is followed by subcutaneous maintenance doses of 360 mg at week 12 and then every 8 weeks.

* **Psoriatic Arthritis:**  A subcutaneous dose of 150 mg is given at weeks 0 and 4, followed by every 12 weeks.  It can be used alone or with other non-biologic medications for this condition.

**Important Note:**  Before starting Risankizumab, patients need to be screened for tuberculosis (TB) infection.  Treatment for latent TB should be completed beforehand.

Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment aren't specified in the manufacturer's labeling.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Pediatric use is not currently established.

### How it Works

Risankizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-23 (IL-23), a protein involved in triggering inflammation in the body.  By binding to IL-23, Risankizumab prevents it from activating immune cells that cause the inflammation characteristic of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and Crohn's disease. This, in turn, reduces inflammation and helps alleviate symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Risankizumab is contraindicated for individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its components.

* **Interactions:** Risankizumab can increase the effects of live vaccines.  Live vaccines should be avoided during treatment.

* **Infections:**  There's an increased risk of infections, including tuberculosis.  Screening for TB is crucial before starting treatment.

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of Risankizumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Discuss these concerns with your healthcare provider.

* **Other Precautions:**  Monitor for signs of infection, liver function abnormalities, and the formation of neutralizing antibodies.
