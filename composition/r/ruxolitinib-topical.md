# Ruxolitinib (Topical)
### Generic Name
Ruxolitinib (Topical)

### Usage

Ruxolitinib topical cream is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor approved for two specific uses:

1. **Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema):** It's indicated for the short-term, non-continuous treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adults and children (12 years and older) whose condition isn't adequately controlled by other topical prescription treatments, or when those treatments aren't suitable.  This means it's used when other eczema treatments haven't worked well enough or can't be used.

2. **Non-segmental Vitiligo:** Ruxolitinib topical cream is also approved for treating non-segmental vitiligo in adults and children (12 years and older).  Vitiligo is a skin condition causing loss of skin color.  This treatment aims to help restore some skin pigmentation.


### Dosage

**Atopic Dermatitis:**

* **Adults and Children (≥12 years):** Apply a thin layer of the 1.5% cream twice daily (BID) to affected areas of up to 20% of the body surface area.  Stop using the cream once the signs and symptoms (itching, rash, redness) improve. If no improvement is seen within 8 weeks, a doctor should re-evaluate the patient.

**Non-segmental Vitiligo:**

* **Adults and Children (≥12 years):** Apply a thin layer of the 1.5% cream twice daily (BID) to affected areas of up to 10% of the body surface area.  Significant repigmentation may take longer than 24 weeks. If there's no meaningful improvement by 24 weeks, a doctor should re-evaluate the patient.

**Important Note:**  Ruxolitinib topical should not be used in combination with other JAK inhibitors, therapeutic biologics, or potent immunosuppressants like azathioprine or cyclosporine.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are specified in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* **Atopic Dermatitis:** Diarrhea, various infections (ear infection, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, folliculitis, tonsillitis), rhinorrhea (runny nose), urticaria (hives), increased eosinophil count.
* **Non-segmental Vitiligo:** Headache, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, application site acne, application site itching, application site redness, fever (pyrexia).

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1% of patients):**

* **Atopic Dermatitis:** Neutropenia (low white blood cell count), allergic conjunctivitis, more serious infections (herpes zoster, otitis externa, staphylococcal infection), acneiform dermatitis, fever (pyrexia), seasonal allergies.
* **Non-segmental Vitiligo:** Insomnia, anxiety, hypertension, gastrointestinal issues (diarrhea, gastritis, gastroenteritis, vomiting), nasal congestion, various infections (ear infection, hordeolum, influenza-like illness), various application site skin reactions (dermatitis, discoloration, folliculitis, contusion, contact dermatitis).

**If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Ruxolitinib is a JAK inhibitor.  JAK enzymes are involved in transmitting signals from cytokines and growth factors—molecules that play a crucial role in inflammation and immune responses.  By inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2, ruxolitinib reduces inflammation associated with atopic dermatitis and potentially promotes repigmentation in vitiligo.  The exact way this impacts the specific skin conditions is still under investigation.


### Precautions

* **Infections:** Ruxolitinib increases the risk of serious infections, including tuberculosis and opportunistic infections.  Patients with active serious infections should not use this medication.  Close monitoring for infection symptoms is necessary.
* **Malignancies:** There is an increased risk of certain cancers, including lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, associated with JAK inhibitors. Regular skin exams are recommended.
* **Cardiovascular Events:**  An increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including death, heart attack, and stroke has been observed. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors should be carefully monitored.
* **Thromboembolic Events:**  There is a heightened risk of blood clots. Patients with a history of blood clots or risk factors for clotting should use caution.
* **Thrombocytopenia, Anemia, and Neutropenia:** Ruxolitinib can decrease blood cell counts, leading to these conditions. Regular blood tests may be necessary.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:**  No dosage adjustments are recommended for liver or kidney impairment, but patients with these conditions should be closely monitored.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Data on the safety of ruxolitinib in pregnancy and breastfeeding is limited.  Women should consult their doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Avoid using ruxolitinib topical with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (an enzyme that processes medications in the liver).
* **Topical Use Only:**  This medication is for external use only.  Avoid contact with eyes, mouth, or vagina.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?**  A: The time to see improvement varies depending on the condition and individual response.  For atopic dermatitis, improvement should be seen within 8 weeks; for vitiligo, meaningful improvement may take longer than 24 weeks.

* **Q: Can I use this with other medications?** A: Consult your doctor about potential interactions with other medications, especially immunosuppressants and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature.
