# Rosuvastatin
### Generic Name
Rosuvastatin

### Usage

Rosuvastatin is primarily used to lower high cholesterol levels in the blood.  This includes reducing levels of total cholesterol, "bad" LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apo B), and triglycerides.  It's prescribed for both lowering cholesterol in individuals who already have high cholesterol (secondary prevention) and for preventing heart and blood vessel problems in people at high risk, even if their cholesterol levels aren't extremely high (primary prevention).  Specific conditions where Rosuvastatin is commonly used include:

* **Familial hypercholesterolemia:**  This is a genetic condition causing very high cholesterol levels. Rosuvastatin is particularly effective in treating both the heterozygous (one affected gene) and homozygous (two affected genes) forms.
* **Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention:** This includes preventing heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular events in individuals at high risk, based on factors like age, smoking history, diabetes, high blood pressure, and family history.
* **Post-transplantation care (off-label):** While not officially approved for this, Rosuvastatin is sometimes used to manage high cholesterol in individuals who have received a heart or kidney transplant.  Immunosuppressant drugs used after transplantation can sometimes elevate cholesterol levels.

### Dosage

Rosuvastatin dosage varies greatly depending on the individual's condition, age, other medications they are taking, and their ethnicity.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

**Adults:**  Dosages range from 5 mg to 40 mg once daily. Higher doses (20-40 mg) are generally considered "high-intensity" therapy, leading to greater cholesterol reduction, and are often used for individuals with severe hypercholesterolemia or a high risk of cardiovascular events. Lower doses (5-10 mg) are considered "moderate-intensity" therapy.  The doctor will adjust the dose based on your response to treatment and potential side effects.

**Children:**  Rosuvastatin can be used in children aged 8 years and older with familial hypercholesterolemia, but the dosage is much lower and carefully monitored by a pediatrician.  The maximum daily dose is 10 mg for children aged 8 to under 10 years and 20 mg for children aged 10 and older.

**Dosage adjustments:**  Kidney and liver function significantly impact Rosuvastatin metabolism.  Individuals with impaired kidney or liver function may require lower doses to avoid complications.


**Forms:** Rosuvastatin is available in tablet and capsule forms.  Capsules can be opened and sprinkled on soft food, but should be swallowed immediately.

### Side Effects

**Common side effects:**  These occur in more than 1% of people taking Rosuvastatin.

* Muscle aches (myalgia)
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT)

**Less common, but serious side effects:**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention.

* Severe muscle pain or weakness (myopathy, rhabdomyolysis â€“ a potentially life-threatening muscle breakdown)
* Liver damage (hepatitis, jaundice)
* Diabetes (new onset or worsening of existing diabetes)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Kidney problems

If you experience any of these side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Rosuvastatin belongs to a class of drugs called statins.  It works by inhibiting an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, which is crucial in the body's production of cholesterol.  By blocking this enzyme, Rosuvastatin reduces the amount of cholesterol your liver produces.  Simultaneously, it increases the number of LDL receptors on liver cells, allowing the liver to remove more LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.  Beyond cholesterol reduction, statins also have other beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, potentially reducing inflammation and improving blood vessel function.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Rosuvastatin is contraindicated in individuals with active liver disease, unexplained elevated liver enzymes, and pregnancy or breastfeeding.  It should also be used cautiously in patients with kidney problems.
* **Drug interactions:**  Many drugs can interact with Rosuvastatin, potentially increasing or decreasing its effectiveness or side effects.  Some important interactions are with other cholesterol-lowering medications (fibrates, niacin), certain immunosuppressants, antibiotics (erythromycin), antifungals (itraconazole), and HIV protease inhibitors. Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Muscle problems:**  Rosuvastatin can cause muscle pain and, in rare cases, more serious muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis).  This risk is higher in older adults, individuals with kidney or liver problems, and those taking certain other medications.  Muscle pain should be reported to a doctor immediately.
* **Liver function:** Regular monitoring of liver enzymes is often recommended, especially at the beginning of treatment.
* **Asian descent:** Patients of Asian descent may be at increased risk of muscle problems at higher doses (40 mg).
* **Alcohol:** Excessive alcohol consumption may increase the risk of liver damage.


### FAQs

* **Can I take Rosuvastatin with food?** Yes, Rosuvastatin can be taken with or without food.
* **How should I store Rosuvastatin?** Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't take a double dose.
* **Can I stop taking Rosuvastatin without consulting my doctor?** No.  Stopping Rosuvastatin suddenly could be harmful.  Always discuss any changes to your medication with your doctor.
* **Is Rosuvastatin safe for long-term use?**  For most individuals, Rosuvastatin is safe for long-term use when properly monitored by a physician.
* **What are the signs of a serious side effect?** Severe muscle pain or weakness, unexplained fatigue, dark urine, yellowing of skin or eyes (jaundice), and allergic reactions are serious side effects requiring immediate medical attention.
