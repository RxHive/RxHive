# Rizatriptan

**Generic Name:** Rizatriptan

**Usage:**

Rizatriptan is a triptan medication used to treat migraine headaches with or without aura.  It's specifically for the *acute* treatment of a migraine attack that's already started, not for prevention. It's not effective for tension headaches or other types of headaches.  It may be taken at the first sign of a migraine or when the headache is already moderate or severe.  The dosage and frequency vary depending on individual needs and the doctor's prescription.  It's typically taken orally (as a tablet or orally disintegrating tablet) but some formulations may be available as nasal spray.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of rizatriptan include:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Weakness
* Tingling or numbness
* Warmth or flushing feeling
* Dry mouth
* Fatigue
* Nausea


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Chest tightness or pain (Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs)
* Irregular heartbeat
* High blood pressure
* Seizures
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Severe dizziness or fainting

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity of side effects can vary from person to person.  It's crucial to report any concerning side effects to a doctor or pharmacist immediately.

**How it Works:**

Rizatriptan is a selective serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist.  This means it works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain and reducing the release of substances that cause pain and inflammation associated with migraines.  It's believed that this helps relieve migraine pain and associated symptoms like nausea and sensitivity to light and sound.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I take rizatriptan with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions can occur.  Specifically, rizatriptan should not be taken with MAO inhibitors or within 24 hours of taking an ergot-derived migraine medication.
* **How long does it take to work?**  Rizatriptan typically starts working within 30 minutes to an hour after ingestion.
* **How often can I take it?**  The frequency of rizatriptan use is limited to prevent overuse headaches and potential adverse effects.  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully. Do not exceed the recommended dosage or frequency.
* **Can I take rizatriptan if I have heart problems?** Rizatriptan can have cardiovascular effects, and its use should be carefully considered in individuals with a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or other cardiovascular conditions.  Your doctor will assess your suitability for this medication.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Rizatriptan is only used when you experience a migraine attack; therefore, missing a dose isn't relevant. Only take it when you have a migraine.
* **Can I take rizatriptan preventatively?** No, rizatriptan is only for *acute* treatment of migraines; it is not a preventative medication.  Other medications are available for migraine prevention.
