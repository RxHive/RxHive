# Rizatriptan
### Generic Name
Rizatriptan

### Usage
Rizatriptan is a triptan medication primarily used for the acute treatment of migraine headaches, both with and without aura, in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years.  It's crucial to remember that Rizatriptan is for treating migraine attacks *as they occur*; it's not a preventative medication to stop migraines from happening in the first place, nor is it effective against cluster headaches.  A proper diagnosis of migraine is necessary before using Rizatriptan.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The usual starting dose is 5-10 mg taken orally at the onset of a migraine.  This dose may be repeated after two hours if necessary, but the total daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.

**Children (6-17 years):** Dosage is weight-based.  Children weighing less than 40 kg receive a single 5 mg oral dose, while those weighing 40 kg or more receive a single 10 mg oral dose.  Administering more than one dose within 24 hours is not recommended for children.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dose adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, although studies show that plasma concentrations are increased by 30% in patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction.  If you have liver or kidney problems, consult your doctor before taking Rizatriptan.  If a patient is also taking propranolol, a lower dose of Rizatriptan is recommended.  Specific recommendations are provided above in the Dosage section.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* High blood pressure (hypertensive crisis)
* Heart attack (myocardial infarction)

It is vital to contact a healthcare professional if you experience any concerning side effects.

### How it Works

Rizatriptan is a selective serotonin receptor agonist (a type of triptan). It works by binding to specific serotonin receptors (5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors) in the brain and blood vessels surrounding the brain.  This action causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and reduces the release of inflammatory substances, thereby relieving migraine pain and associated symptoms.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Rizatriptan is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with:

* Allergy to Rizatriptan or any ingredient in the formulation
* Ischemic heart disease (e.g., angina, heart attack)
* Coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina)
* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) history
* Peripheral vascular disease
* Ischemic bowel disease
* Uncontrolled high blood pressure
* Recent use of other 5-HT1 agonists, ergotamine-containing medications, or MAO inhibitors
* Hemiplegic or basilar migraine
* Severe hepatic impairment


**Warnings and Precautions:** Use caution in patients with liver or kidney problems, and those taking other medications.  Close monitoring is advised for patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or smoking.  Rizatriptan should be used with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Avoid concurrent use with other medications that might interact, including antidepressants, particularly those that also increase serotonin levels.
