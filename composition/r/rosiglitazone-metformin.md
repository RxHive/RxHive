# Rosiglitazone + Metformin
### Generic Name
Rosiglitazone + Metformin

**Note:**  Rosiglitazone and Metformin are not typically combined into a single pill.  They are often prescribed together, but as separate medications. This information describes each drug individually and then discusses their combined use.  Always follow your doctor's prescription instructions.


### Usage

**Rosiglitazone:** This medication belongs to a class of drugs called thiazolidinediones. It's primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by increasing the sensitivity of your body's cells to insulin, allowing your body to use the insulin more effectively to lower blood sugar levels.

**Metformin:** This medication belongs to a class of drugs called biguanides. It's also primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes.  It works by decreasing the amount of glucose your liver produces, decreasing glucose absorption in the intestines, and improving your body's sensitivity to insulin.

**Combined Use:**  Doctors often prescribe rosiglitazone and metformin together when metformin alone isn't enough to control blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.  The combination leverages the different mechanisms of action of each drug, potentially offering better blood sugar control than either drug alone.


### Dosage

Dosage for both rosiglitazone and metformin must be determined by a doctor and is highly individualized.  There's no single "Rosiglitazone + Metformin" dosage.

**Rosiglitazone:**  Available as tablets.  Dosage typically starts low and is gradually increased as needed, based on blood sugar levels and individual response.  It should not exceed a certain maximum daily dose.  Specific dosing instructions are found on the medication's label and are crucial to follow precisely.

**Metformin:** Available as tablets and extended-release tablets. Dosage depends on many factors, including the patient's age, kidney function, and response to treatment. Starting dosages are typically low and gradually increased.  Like rosiglitazone, specific dosing instructions are found on the medication's label and must be followed carefully.  Extended-release formulations are often preferred for once-daily dosing convenience.

**Important:**  There are no IV formulations for either rosiglitazone or metformin.  Always follow your doctor’s instructions regarding the correct dosage and administration of both medications.


### Side Effects

**Rosiglitazone:**

*   Fluid retention (edema)
*   Weight gain
*   Headache
*   Bone fractures (increased risk)
*   Heart failure (increased risk – a serious side effect)


**Metformin:**

*   Nausea
*   Diarrhea
*   Stomach upset
*   Metallic taste in the mouth
*   Lactic acidosis (a rare but serious side effect)


**Important:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.


### How it Works

As explained in the "Usage" section, rosiglitazone improves insulin sensitivity, and metformin reduces glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity through different mechanisms. When used together, they create a synergistic effect, offering potentially enhanced blood sugar control compared to using either drug alone.


### Precautions

**Rosiglitazone:**

*   Increased risk of heart failure, especially in patients with a history of heart disease.
*   Increased risk of bone fractures.
*   May worsen fluid retention.
*   Use with caution in patients with liver problems.


**Metformin:**

*   Kidney function must be monitored regularly, as metformin is excreted by the kidneys.
*   Should be avoided in patients with severe kidney disease.
*   Increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with liver disease, heart failure, or alcohol abuse.
*   Should be stopped temporarily before and during procedures with contrast dye.
*   May cause vitamin B12 deficiency over time.


**Combined Use Precautions:**  The combined use of these medications requires careful monitoring of kidney function, blood sugar levels, and potential side effects.  Always inform your doctor of any other medications you are taking, as drug interactions are possible. Pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a doctor before taking either medication.
