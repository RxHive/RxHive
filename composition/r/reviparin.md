# Reviparin

**Generic Name:** Reviparin Sodium

**Usage:**

Reviparin is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).  It's primarily used for:

* **Prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) after surgery:** Particularly in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery.
* **Treatment of DVT and PE:** Although other anticoagulants are often preferred for treatment.
* **Treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (NSTEMI):**  Often used in conjunction with other therapies.

**Note:**  The specific usage and dosage will be determined by a healthcare professional based on the individual patient's condition and medical history.  This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, reviparin can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency. Some common side effects include:

* **Bleeding:** This is the most significant risk associated with reviparin, ranging from minor bruising to severe and life-threatening hemorrhage.
* **Injection site reactions:** Pain, bruising, swelling, redness, or irritation at the injection site.
* **Thrombocytopenia:** A decrease in the number of platelets in the blood, which can increase the risk of bleeding.  This is a rare but serious side effect.
* **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT):** A rare but serious condition where the body develops antibodies against heparin, leading to a paradoxical increase in clotting.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Less common side effects.


**How it Works:**

Reviparin is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).  It works by:

* **Inhibiting thrombin and factor Xa:** These are crucial enzymes involved in the blood clotting cascade. By inhibiting them, reviparin prevents the formation of blood clots.
* **Increasing the activity of antithrombin III:**  This natural anticoagulant in the blood works more effectively in the presence of reviparin, further enhancing its anticoagulant effects.
