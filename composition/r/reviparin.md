# Reviparin
### Generic Name
Reviparin

### Usage
Reviparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) primarily used for the prevention of thromboembolism (blood clots) after surgery.  Its main application is in post-surgical prophylaxis, reducing the risk of potentially life-threatening complications like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). While not its primary indication, it may be considered in other situations requiring anticoagulation under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the type of surgery and individual patient factors.  It's crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions precisely.  The following is general information and should not be interpreted as a substitute for professional medical guidance:

* **Thromboembolism Prophylaxis (Adults):**  Dosage is typically administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  The specific dose and duration depend on the surgical procedure:
    * **General Surgery:** 1750 anti-Xa IU once daily (OD) for at least six days.
    * **Knee Arthroscopy:** 1750 anti-Xa IU OD, given 2-4 hours before surgery for 7-10 days.
    * **Orthopedic Surgery:** 4200 anti-Xa IU OD. The first dose is given 12 hours before surgery, and prophylaxis continues until bilateral venography (10-13 days).

* **Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Reviparin in children have not been established.

* **Dosage Adjustments:** Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with impaired hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) function.  These adjustments should always be made under the direction of a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Injection site hematoma (bruising)
* Pain or burning at the injection site

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Hematoma (larger bruise or blood clot)
* Paralysis (in rare instances)


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Reviparin is an anticoagulant that works by inhibiting factor Xa, a crucial clotting factor in the blood.  It does this by enhancing the activity of antithrombin III, a natural body protein that inhibits several clotting factors.  By targeting factor Xa, Reviparin helps prevent the formation of blood clots, reducing the risk of DVT and PE.  It's important to note that Reviparin doesn't prolong prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT), common blood clotting tests.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Reviparin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Reviparin, active bleeding (except disseminated intravascular coagulation), cerebral aneurysm, uncontrolled hypertension, severe gastric or duodenal ulcers (unless the reason for surgery), acute bacterial endocarditis, diabetic retinopathy, or a positive in vitro aggregation test in patients with a history of heparin-associated thrombocytopenia.

* **Increased Risk:**  Patients using Reviparin may have an increased risk of skin rashes, hematomas, thrombocytopenia, and hepatotoxicity.

* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with other anticoagulants, fibrinolytics, vitamin K derivatives, platelet aggregation inhibitors (e.g., dipyridamole, salicylates, NSAIDs, and sulfinpyrazone), SSRIs, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids increases the risk of bleeding.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Reviparin during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.

* **Special Populations:** Close monitoring is essential for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, elderly patients, and those with a history of bleeding disorders.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Reviparin administered?** A: Reviparin is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) by injection.

* **Q: How should I store Reviparin?** A: Store Reviparin as directed by your physician or pharmacist, usually at a controlled room temperature, protected from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your physician or pharmacist immediately. Do not attempt to double up on the missed dose.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Reviparin?** A: It is generally advised to avoid alcohol consumption while on Reviparin due to the increased risk of bleeding.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience bleeding while taking Reviparin?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately.  Excessive or prolonged bleeding is a serious concern.
