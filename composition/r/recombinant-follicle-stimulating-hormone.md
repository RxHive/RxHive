# Recombinant follicle stimulating hormone
### Generic Name
Recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone (rFSH)

### Usage
Recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone (rFSH) is a fertility medication primarily used to stimulate the growth and maturation of follicles in the ovaries.  This is crucial for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).  It's used to help women produce multiple eggs, increasing the chances of successful fertilization and pregnancy.  In men, rFSH can be used to treat certain types of infertility caused by low sperm production due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.  The specific use and dosage will always be determined by a fertility specialist based on individual needs and response.


### Dosage
Dosage of rFSH varies significantly based on the individual's response, the specific ART protocol, and whether it's used in women or men. There isn't a standard "one-size-fits-all" dosage.  It's administered via subcutaneous injection (under the skin).  

* **Women (IVF/ART):**  The starting dose is typically determined through blood tests and ultrasound monitoring of follicle development.  The dose is adjusted based on the ovarian response, monitored closely by blood tests and ultrasound scans to avoid hyperstimulation syndrome.  Dosage ranges greatly and is individually tailored.

* **Men (Infertility):** Doses are usually lower than those used in women and are also individually tailored based on hormonal levels and response to treatment.


**There are no oral forms of rFSH.**  Dosage instructions are always provided by a fertility specialist and should be followed meticulously.

### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Ovarian enlargement, abdominal bloating, breast tenderness, headache, mood swings.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) â€“ a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by severe ovarian enlargement, abdominal pain, and fluid buildup; multiple pregnancies; thromboembolic events (blood clots).

**Note:** Any unusual symptoms, particularly severe abdominal pain, should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
rFSH is a bioengineered version of the naturally occurring follicle-stimulating hormone.  In women, FSH stimulates the growth and maturation of follicles in the ovaries, each containing an egg. By increasing FSH levels, more eggs develop, making them available for retrieval during IVF or similar procedures.  In men, rFSH stimulates the Sertoli cells in the testes, which are essential for sperm production.  This leads to an increase in sperm count and improved sperm quality in some men with specific types of infertility.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** rFSH should not be used in women with certain conditions, including ovarian tumors, unexplained uterine bleeding, and primary gonadal failure.  It should also not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to FSH.  
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as some medications may interact with rFSH.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  rFSH is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Older Adults and Children:** The use of rFSH is generally restricted to adults of reproductive age.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The response to rFSH varies greatly, and monitoring is crucial to assess its effectiveness. Results are typically seen within weeks.  This is closely monitored by the fertility specialist using blood tests and ultrasounds.

* **Q: Is rFSH safe?** A:  While generally safe when used under appropriate medical supervision, rFSH can cause side effects, some of which can be serious.  Close monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential.

* **Q: How is rFSH stored?** A:  rFSH should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically refrigerated.


* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Do not attempt to make up a missed dose yourself.  Contact your fertility specialist for guidance on what to do.

* **Q: Can rFSH cause multiple pregnancies?** A: Yes, it increases the chance of multiple pregnancies, which carries risks to both the mother and the babies.
