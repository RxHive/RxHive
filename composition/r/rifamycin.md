# Rifamycin
### Generic Name
Rifamycin

### Usage
Rifamycin is an antibacterial medication primarily used to treat traveler's diarrhea in adults caused by non-invasive strains of *Escherichia coli*.  It's important to note that it is *not* effective against all causes of diarrhea, and its use should be restricted to this specific indication.  It does not treat severe or bloody diarrhea.

### Dosage
**Adults (Traveler's Diarrhea):** The typical adult dose is 388 mg twice daily (BID) for three days.  The medication should be taken orally, with a 6-8 ounce glass of water (not alcohol), and can be taken with or without food. Tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed, broken, or chewed.

**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of Rifamycin in children have not been established, therefore it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Constipation
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)

**Less Common Side Effects (Frequency not defined):**

* Abdominal pain
* Fever

If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.  The development of severe diarrhea, bloody stools, or high fever necessitates prompt medical attention.


### How it Works
Rifamycin belongs to the ansamycin class of antibiotics.  It works by inhibiting the beta-subunit of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.  This enzyme is crucial for bacterial DNA transcription, a process essential for bacterial protein synthesis and growth. By blocking this process, Rifamycin effectively stops the growth and reproduction of susceptible bacteria.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Rifamycin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to Rifamycin, other ansamycin antibiotics (like rifaximin), or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Severe Diarrhea:** Rifamycin is not appropriate for the treatment of diarrhea complicated by fever and/or bloody stools, or diarrhea caused by pathogens other than non-invasive *E. coli*.
* **Drug-Resistant Bacteria:**  Overuse of antibiotics can contribute to the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Use Rifamycin only when necessary and as directed by a healthcare professional.
* **Interactions:**  Rifamycin may interact with certain vaccines (cholera, typhoid) and laxatives (sodium picosulfate), potentially reducing their effectiveness. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about any other medications you are taking before starting Rifamycin.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Rifamycin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  A healthcare provider should weigh the potential risks and benefits of using this medication in pregnant or breastfeeding women.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  While specific dosage adjustments aren't provided for liver or kidney problems, low systemic absorption suggests adjustments may not be necessary. However, it's crucial to consult with a physician before using Rifamycin if you have liver or kidney disease.
