# Rosoxacin
### Generic Name
Rosoxacin

### Usage
Rosoxacin is a quinolone antibiotic primarily used to treat uncomplicated gonorrhea.  This means it's effective against this sexually transmitted infection in its early stages, before it has spread extensively. It's specifically indicated for uncomplicated cases and may not be suitable for more severe or disseminated infections.


### Dosage
**Adults:** For uncomplicated gonorrhea, the typical dose is 200-400 mg as a single oral dose, or 300mg as a single oral dose.  Dosage may vary depending on the physician's assessment.

**Children:** Rosoxacin is contraindicated (should not be used) in children under 18 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment, particularly those with existing hepatitis and venereal disease.  The medication is contraindicated in patients with severe renal (kidney) impairment. For mild to moderate renal impairment, dosage adjustments may not be necessary, but this should always be discussed with a doctor.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Abdominal pain

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include:

* Tendon rupture or tendonitis (inflammation of the tendons)
* Toxic psychosis (severe mental disturbance)
* Convulsions (seizures)
* Altered visual perception
* Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells, more common in older adults)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Skin reactions


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Rosoxacin is a type of antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial enzymes called topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV. These enzymes are essential for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. By inhibiting these enzymes, rosoxacin prevents bacterial DNA from replicating and ultimately kills the bacteria.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Rosoxacin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, severe renal impairment, convulsive conditions, and in children under 18 years of age.

**Warnings and Precautions:** Use with caution in patients with underlying central nervous system (CNS) disorders, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, renal or hepatic impairment, and porphyria.  


**Drug Interactions:**  The absorption of rosoxacin can be reduced when taken concurrently with sucralfate or preparations containing divalent or trivalent cations.  Concurrent use with probenecid increases rosoxacin concentration. Combining rosoxacin with cyclosporine may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity (kidney damage).  Concurrent use with oral anticoagulants (blood thinners) like warfarin may enhance their effects. Using NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) with rosoxacin might increase the risk of convulsions.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of rosoxacin during pregnancy is unknown. It's also unknown whether rosoxacin is excreted in breast milk, therefore caution is advised when considering its use during breastfeeding.

**General Precautions:** Patients should avoid excessive sun exposure and take precautions to minimize exposure.  Patients should be cautioned against operating machinery or driving due to the potential for dizziness.
