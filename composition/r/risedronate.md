# Risedronate

**Generic Name:** Risedronate sodium

**Usage:**

Risedronate sodium is a bisphosphonate medication used to treat and prevent several bone diseases characterized by excessive bone loss:

* **Osteoporosis:**  It's used to increase bone mass and reduce the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women and men with osteoporosis.
* **Paget's disease of bone:** It helps reduce bone pain and the risk of fractures in patients with Paget's disease.
* **Hypercalcemia of malignancy:** In some cases, it's used to treat high blood calcium levels caused by cancer.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects (occurring in more than 1% of patients) can include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** These are the most frequent side effects and can include heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and dyspepsia (indigestion).
* **Muscle and bone pain:**  Pain in the muscles, bones, or joints is relatively common.
* **Headache:**
* **Flu-like symptoms:**
* **Esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus):** This is a serious side effect and is more likely if the medication isn't taken correctly (see FAQs).

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ):**  Rare but serious condition affecting the jawbone.  Risk is increased with dental procedures.
* **Atypical femoral fractures:**  Unusual fractures of the thigh bone.
* **Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium):**  Usually occurs in patients with existing low calcium levels.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**


**How it Works:**

Risedronate sodium works by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption (breakdown). By slowing down bone resorption, it allows for an increase in bone mineral density and reduces the risk of fractures.  It essentially slows the rate at which bone is broken down, allowing the body to rebuild stronger bone tissue.


**FAQs:**

* **How should I take risedronate?**  It's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  Generally, it's taken once weekly, usually first thing in the morning, at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day.  **It must be taken with a full glass of plain water (not tap water) and you must remain upright (sitting or standing) for at least 30 minutes after taking the medication.**  Lying down can increase the risk of esophageal irritation.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Don't take a double dose. Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, as long as it's still before your next scheduled dose. If it's almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time.

* **What are the precautions I should take?**  Inform your doctor of any pre-existing medical conditions, especially those affecting the esophagus, kidneys, or calcium levels. Regular dental checkups are also important, especially if you're at increased risk of ONJ.  Avoid lying down after taking the medication.

* **Can I take risedronate with other medications?**  Tell your doctor about all the medications, vitamins, and supplements you're taking to avoid potential interactions.

* **Is risedronate safe for long-term use?**  The safety and efficacy of risedronate have been demonstrated in long-term studies, but your doctor will monitor your progress and adjust treatment as needed.
