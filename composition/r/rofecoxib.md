# Rofecoxib

**Generic Name:** Rofecoxib

**Usage:** Rofecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that was primarily used to relieve the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and acute pain, such as menstrual cramps or post-surgical pain.  **However, rofecoxib is no longer available in most countries due to serious cardiovascular risks.**  This information is for educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its use.  Never use rofecoxib without consulting a doctor.

**Side Effects:**  The most significant side effect of rofecoxib, which led to its withdrawal from the market, was an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke.  Other side effects included:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn.  Although rofecoxib was marketed as having a lower risk of gastrointestinal ulcers compared to some other NSAIDs, this was not entirely accurate and some GI issues could still occur.
* **Cardiovascular:**  Increased blood pressure, edema (swelling).  As mentioned above, the most serious risk was increased cardiovascular events.
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling.
* **Renal:**  Fluid retention, kidney problems (rare but serious).

**How it Works:** Rofecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor.  COX-2 is an enzyme involved in the production of prostaglandins, which contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By selectively inhibiting COX-2, rofecoxib aimed to reduce pain and inflammation with less gastrointestinal irritation than non-selective NSAIDs (which inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2). However, the selective COX-2 inhibition was later linked to the increased cardiovascular risk.


**FAQs:**

* **Is rofecoxib still available?** No, rofecoxib (Vioxx) was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in most countries due to safety concerns related to increased cardiovascular risk.
* **What are the safer alternatives to rofecoxib?**  There are many other NSAIDs and pain relievers available, including ibuprofen, naproxen, and celecoxib.  Your doctor can help you choose the best option for your specific needs and health condition.  It is crucial to discuss the risks and benefits of any medication with your doctor before taking it.
* **Why was rofecoxib withdrawn?**  Extensive research demonstrated a statistically significant increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with rofecoxib use, particularly with long-term use and in higher-risk patients.
* **Can I use rofecoxib if I have a history of heart disease?** No, absolutely not.  The increased cardiovascular risk associated with rofecoxib makes it contraindicated for patients with a history of heart disease or other cardiovascular risk factors.
