# Racecadotril
### Generic Name
Racecadotril

### Usage
Racecadotril is primarily used to treat acute diarrhea in adults and children older than 3 months.  It's particularly helpful in reducing the frequency and severity of watery stools associated with acute diarrhea.  It works by targeting the underlying mechanism of diarrhea, rather than simply treating the symptoms.  It is *not* indicated for all types of diarrhea, particularly those involving fever or blood in the stool (suggesting a more serious infection), or diarrhea induced by broad-spectrum antibiotics.


### Dosage

**Adults:** The usual dose is 100 mg three times a day (TID) until the symptoms improve (defined as two normal bowel movements), but treatment should not exceed seven days.

**Children (over 3 months):** Dosage is determined by weight.  A common recommendation is 1.5 mg/kg/dose three times daily, up to a maximum of 6 mg/kg/day.  Alternatively, dosages may be given based on age and weight bands:

* Children 3-9 months (<9 kg): 10 mg every 8 hours
* Children 10-35 months (9-13 kg): 20 mg every 8 hours
* Children 3-8 years (14-27 kg): 30 mg every 8 hours
* Children 9-14 years (>27 kg): 60 mg every 8 hours


Treatment duration should not exceed seven days.  Always follow the prescription instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Racecadotril is available in various forms, such as capsules and oral powders, and the administration method will be specified on the packaging.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment; however, caution is advised in these populations. Always consult your doctor before administering any medication to patients with impaired liver or kidney function.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include headache.

Less common side effects (frequency not clearly defined) may include:

* Swelling of lips and tongue
* Skin reactions (erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, facial swelling, papular rash, prurigo, pruritus, toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria)
* Angioedema (swelling beneath the skin)
* Blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids)
* Tonsillitis

Rare side effects (<1% of patients) may include a skin rash.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, stop taking Racecadotril and immediately consult a healthcare professional.


### How it Works

Racecadotril is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form (thiorphan) in the body.  Thiorphan inhibits an enzyme called enkephalinase, which is found in the lining of the small intestine.  Enkephalinase breaks down peptides (small protein chains), including those that regulate fluid secretion in the gut.  By inhibiting enkephalinase, Racecadotril reduces the excessive secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestines, thereby alleviating diarrhea.  It's important to note that Racecadotril doesn't affect the normal gut transit time.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Racecadotril is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, sucrose intolerance, pregnancy, breastfeeding, entero-invasive diarrhea (diarrhea with fever and blood), and diarrhea caused by broad-spectrum antibiotics.

* **Warnings:**  Increased risk of angioedema and skin reactions has been observed.

* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with impaired liver or kidney function.

* **Drug Interactions:** Racecadotril may increase the levels and effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Racecadotril is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to insufficient data on its safety.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Racecadotril with other medications?** A: Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications, vitamins, or supplements you are taking to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: How should I store Racecadotril?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is Racecadotril suitable for all types of diarrhea?** A: No, it is not suitable for all types of diarrhea.  It is not effective for diarrhea accompanied by fever or blood in the stool or diarrhea caused by antibiotics.

* **Q: How long does it take for Racecadotril to work?** A: The onset of action varies, but typically, symptom improvement is observed within a few days.

* **Q: What should I do if my diarrhea doesn't improve after taking Racecadotril?** A: Consult your doctor if your diarrhea persists or worsens after 7 days of treatment.  Persistent diarrhea may indicate a more serious underlying condition.
