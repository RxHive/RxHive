# Rifampin/Rifampicin + Isoniazid
### Generic Name
Rifampin/Rifampicin + Isoniazid

### Usage

This fixed-dose combination of Rifampin (also known as Rifampicin) and Isoniazid is specifically used to treat pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) caused by susceptible bacteria.  It's crucial that the patient has undergone individual assessment and titration for both Rifampin and Isoniazid before starting this combination therapy.  This combination therapy is part of a broader treatment plan guided by current tuberculosis treatment guidelines.  It is not a standalone cure and requires adherence to a complete treatment regimen prescribed by a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Tuberculosis:** The dosage varies based on the formulation available.  Common formulations and their respective dosages are:
    * Capsules (Rifampin 300 mg/Isoniazid 150 mg per capsule): Two capsules once daily.
    * Tablets (Rifampicin 150 mg/Isoniazid 100 mg): Three tablets once daily for patients weighing less than 50 kg.
    * Tablets (Rifampin 300 mg/Isoniazid 150 mg): Two tablets once daily for patients weighing 50 kg or more.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Tuberculosis:** Adolescents aged 15 years and older receive the same dosage as adults.  Dosage for children younger than 15 years requires careful calculation by a healthcare professional and should be tailored to the child's weight and other factors.  It is not advised to use these formulations for children below 15 years without appropriate medical supervision and dosage adjustment.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment.  Caution is advised, and the medication is contraindicated in patients with severe or acute hepatic impairment or a history of Isoniazid-associated liver injury.  Treatment should be stopped if new or worsening liver damage occurs.
* **Renal Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for renal impairment.  However, caution is warranted, particularly in cases of severe renal impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  The frequency of these side effects is not consistently defined across sources.

* **Rifampin:**  Decreased blood pressure, flushing, shock, vasculitis, ataxia, behavioral changes, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, headache, lack of concentration, myasthenia, numbness, peripheral pain, sore mouth, skin rashes (including erythema multiforme, pemphigoid reactions, pruritus, and urticaria), abdominal cramps, anorexia, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, flatulence, glossalgia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, changes in urine and stool color,  abnormal liver function tests,  blood disorders (e.g., decreased hemoglobin, thrombocytopenia),  and conjunctivitis.

* **Isoniazid:** Increased liver enzyme levels, gynecomastia, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, pellagra, pyridoxine deficiency, skin rashes, peripheral neuropathy, psychosis, seizures, nausea, vomiting, and various blood disorders (e.g., anemia, eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy, thrombocytopenia).

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:** Both Rifampin and Isoniazid can, in rare cases, cause serious side effects, including severe liver damage (hepatitis),  severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis),  and other life-threatening complications.  

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If any adverse effects occur,  consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Isoniazid interferes with the production of mycolic acid, a crucial component of the bacterial cell wall of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. This disruption weakens the bacterial cell wall and leads to bacterial death.

Rifampin inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis by binding to the beta-subunit of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thus halting the transcription process essential for bacterial growth and survival.  The combined action of these two drugs enhances their effectiveness against the tuberculosis bacteria.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This combination is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Rifampin, other rifamycins, Isoniazid, or any formulation components; acute gout;  a history of severe adverse reactions to Isoniazid (e.g., drug-induced hepatitis); concurrent use with specific medications (check current drug interactions); severe or acute hepatic damage.

* **Warnings:** Increased risks include coagulopathy, flu-like syndrome, hematologic effects, hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, and peripheral neuropathies.

* **Cautious Use:** Exercise caution in patients with a history of alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, hepatic impairment, porphyria, or severe renal impairment.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Both Rifampin and Isoniazid are classified as Category C drugs during pregnancy. They are also excreted in breast milk.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered after careful risk-benefit assessment by a healthcare professional.

* **Drug Interactions:**  This combination can interact significantly with other medications. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: No. Alcohol consumption is strongly discouraged while taking this medication due to potential increased liver toxicity risk.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the medication at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.
