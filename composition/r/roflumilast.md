# Roflumilast
### Generic Name
Roflumilast

### Usage
Roflumilast is primarily used to reduce exacerbations (worsening of symptoms) in adults with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have a history of exacerbations despite regular use of long-acting bronchodilators.  It's an anti-inflammatory medication, meaning it works to reduce the inflammation in the lungs that contributes to COPD symptoms.  Roflumilast is *not* a bronchodilator; it doesn't directly open up the airways.  Therefore, it is used *in addition to* bronchodilators, not as a replacement.


### Dosage

**Adults (COPD):**  The typical starting dose is 250 mcg once daily for four weeks. After this initial period, the dose is usually increased to 500 mcg once daily.  This medication should be taken consistently as directed by your doctor.

**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of roflumilast in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Problems):**  Roflumilast is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with moderate to severe liver impairment.  Use in patients with mild impairment requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional.
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Problems):** No dosage adjustment is usually necessary for patients with kidney problems.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in 2-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Weight loss
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Decreased appetite
* Influenza (flu)
* Back pain


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  The following side effects are less frequent but can be serious.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these:

* Abdominal pain
* Anemia
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Suicidal thoughts or behaviors
* Allergic reactions (angioedema, rash, urticaria)
* Pancreatitis
* Severe liver problems


This is not an exhaustive list of all possible side effects.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any side effects, especially if they are persistent or bothersome.


### How it Works

Roflumilast works by selectively inhibiting an enzyme called phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4).  PDE4 normally breaks down a substance called cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) within lung cells. By inhibiting PDE4, roflumilast increases the levels of cAMP. This increased cAMP has anti-inflammatory effects, reducing the inflammation in the lungs that contributes to COPD exacerbations.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Roflumilast is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug or its components, moderate to severe liver impairment, and acute bronchospasm.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Several drugs can interact with roflumilast, affecting its metabolism and potentially altering its effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  Examples include certain anticonvulsants (like carbamazepine and phenytoin), antibiotics (like rifampin), and other medications.  It is crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Roflumilast is classified as a Pregnancy Category C drug.  This means that its potential risks to a developing fetus are unknown. Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication.
* **Other Precautions:** Patients with a history of neuropsychiatric disorders should be carefully monitored, as roflumilast may increase the risk of mood changes. Weight loss is a common side effect; regular monitoring of weight is recommended.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take roflumilast with food?** A: Roflumilast can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The full therapeutic effect of roflumilast may not be seen immediately. It typically takes several weeks of consistent use before a noticeable reduction in exacerbations is observed.
* **Q: Can I stop taking roflumilast suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop taking roflumilast suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly could potentially worsen your condition.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.
