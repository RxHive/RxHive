# Roflumilast

**Generic Name:** Roflumilast

**Usage:**

Roflumilast is used to reduce exacerbations (worsening of symptoms) in adults with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have chronic bronchitis.  It's specifically indicated for patients with a history of exacerbations despite regular use of bronchodilators.  It's *not* a rescue medication for immediate relief of breathing problems.  It's a long-term maintenance therapy.

**Side Effects:**

Roflumilast can cause a range of side effects, some common and some rare.  The most common include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea (often severe enough to necessitate discontinuation of the medication), nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
* **Central Nervous System:** Headache, insomnia, dizziness.
* **Other:** Weight loss, infection (upper respiratory tract infections are common).


Less common, but more serious side effects, include:

* **Psychiatric:** Depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation.  Patients should be closely monitored for these.
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased heart rate (tachycardia).
* **Hepatic:** Liver enzyme elevation (requiring monitoring of liver function).


It's crucial to note that this is not an exhaustive list.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects.

**How it Works:**

Roflumilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor.  PDE4 is an enzyme that plays a role in the inflammatory process in the lungs.  By inhibiting PDE4, roflumilast reduces the inflammatory response in the airways, thereby lessening the frequency and severity of COPD exacerbations.  It doesn't directly relax the airways like bronchodilators, but rather works to prevent the inflammation that leads to airway narrowing.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take roflumilast as needed?** A: No, roflumilast is a maintenance medication that must be taken daily as prescribed, even when feeling well. It's not a rescue medication for immediate symptom relief.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe diarrhea?** A: Severe diarrhea is a common side effect.  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience this, as it may necessitate a change in dosage or discontinuation of the medication.

* **Q: Can I take roflumilast with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking before starting roflumilast. Interactions with other medications are possible.

* **Q:  How long does it take to work?** A:  The full benefits of roflumilast may not be seen immediately.  It usually takes several weeks to several months for its effects to become apparent.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
