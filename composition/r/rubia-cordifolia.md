### Usage
Rubia cordifolia, also known as manjistha or Indian madder, is a medicinal plant traditionally used for various purposes, primarily related to blood-related issues and inflammation.  While it's been employed for centuries in traditional medicine systems, its clinical applications require further research.  Its traditional uses include addressing blood disorders and acting as an anti-inflammatory agent.  However, it is crucial to note that the clinical efficacy and dosing of Rubia cordifolia are not definitively established due to the limited availability of robust clinical evidence.  Any use should be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage
There is no established standardized dosage for Rubia cordifolia due to a lack of sufficient clinical trials.  Traditional uses vary widely depending on the preparation (e.g., powder, extract, decoction) and the specific condition being treated. Dosage information available is primarily from traditional practices and should not be considered medically validated.  **It is essential to consult a qualified healthcare professional before using Rubia cordifolia, as self-medication can be risky.**  They can provide appropriate guidance on dosage and preparation methods if they deem it appropriate for your situation.

### Side Effects
While generally considered safe in traditional practices, potential side effects of Rubia cordifolia are not fully documented in scientific literature.  Reported side effects may vary depending on the preparation method, dosage, and individual sensitivity.  Because of the limited research, a definitive list of common side effects cannot be provided.  However, it is crucial to be aware of the possibility of unexpected reactions.

**If you experience any adverse effects after using Rubia cordifolia, discontinue use immediately and consult a healthcare provider.**

### How it Works
The precise mechanism of action for Rubia cordifolia is not fully understood scientifically.  However, its components, notably antioxidants like alizarin, hydroxyl anthraquinone, and rubiadin, are believed to contribute to its observed effects.  These compounds may exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, potentially contributing to its traditional uses in treating certain conditions.  Further research is needed to fully elucidate its mechanism of action.
