# Retinoic Acid
### Generic Name
Retinoic Acid (Tretinoin)

### Usage
Retinoic acid, also known as tretinoin, is primarily used topically to treat acne vulgaris.  It works by reducing the stickiness of skin cells lining hair follicles, preventing the formation of clogged pores (comedones) that lead to acne.  This action helps unclog pores and reduce inflammation.

Beyond acne treatment, retinoic acid is also used to improve the appearance of fine wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation (uneven skin tone), and rough skin texture, particularly on the face.  It achieves this by increasing cell turnover, promoting collagen production, and reducing the appearance of age spots.


### Dosage

**Acne Vulgaris:**

* **Topical (Gel/Cream 0.01-0.05%):**  Apply a small amount once daily (OD) to affected areas before bedtime or in the evening.  Start with a lower concentration and gradually increase as tolerated.

**Fine Wrinkles, Hyperpigmentation, Rough Skin Texture:**

* **Topical (Gel/Cream 0.01-0.05%):** Apply a pea-sized amount to the entire face once daily in the evening or before bedtime.

**Pediatric Dosage (Children â‰¥ 8 years and adolescents):**

* **Topical:** Apply to affected areas once daily. Begin with a lower concentration and increase as tolerated. If stinging or irritation occurs, reduce application frequency.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are typically needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment due to low systemic absorption of topical retinoic acid.  However, always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.


### Side Effects

* **Common (>10%):** Skin stinging, dryness, redness (erythema), irritation, itching (pruritus), peeling (desquamation), and hypopigmentation (loss of skin color).
* **Less Common (1-10%):** Hyperpigmentation (darkening of skin), pain at application site, dermatitis.
* **Less Frequent (<1% or post-marketing):** Skin photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight), contact dermatitis.

**Important Note:** If you experience any side effects, particularly severe or persistent ones, discontinue use and consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Retinoic acid is a derivative of vitamin A. When applied topically, it accelerates the natural process of skin cell renewal.  It does this by:

* **Reducing cohesion of follicular epithelial cells:** This prevents the clogging of pores, a primary cause of acne.
* **Increasing cell turnover:** This helps remove clogged pores and reduces the buildup of dead skin cells.
* **Stimulating collagen production (in anti-aging applications):** This improves skin elasticity and reduces the appearance of wrinkles.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to retinoic acid or any formulation component.  It is absolutely **contraindicated** during pregnancy due to its teratogenic effects (it can cause birth defects). It should also be avoided by women planning pregnancy or at high risk for pregnancy.
* **Interactions:** Avoid concurrent use with aminolevulinic acid (systemic) or multivitamins.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about other potential drug interactions.
* **Warnings:** Retinoic acid can increase sun sensitivity; use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher during the day.  Avoid excessive sun exposure.  It should be used cautiously in individuals with eczema or a history of skin cancer.  Breastfeeding mothers should use with caution as excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **General Considerations:** This medication is for external use only.  Avoid contact with eyes, mouth, and nose.  If irritation occurs, reduce application frequency or discontinue use temporarily.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?**  A:  Visible improvement in acne may take several weeks, while effects on wrinkles and skin texture can take longer, sometimes months.
* **Q: Can I use it with other acne treatments?** A: Consult your doctor before combining retinoic acid with other topical acne treatments.  Using multiple products simultaneously may increase the risk of irritation.
* **Q: How should I store retinoic acid?** A: Store it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the next dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for the next dose. Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: Is retinoic acid safe for all skin types?** A:  While generally safe, it may cause more irritation on sensitive skin. Start with a lower concentration and closely monitor for any adverse reactions.  If you have concerns, consult your dermatologist.
