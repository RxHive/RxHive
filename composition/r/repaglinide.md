# Repaglinide

**Generic Name:** Repaglinide

**Usage:** Repaglinide is an oral medication used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. It's used to help control blood sugar levels in adults when diet and exercise alone are not enough.  It's a meglitinide, a class of drugs that stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin.  Repaglinide is typically taken just before meals.  The dosage is adjusted based on individual blood sugar levels and response to the medication.  It is not typically used in type 1 diabetes or during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects of repaglinide include:

* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** This is the most common and serious side effect. Symptoms can include dizziness, sweating, shakiness, hunger, confusion, and rapid heartbeat.  Severe hypoglycemia can lead to loss of consciousness.
* **Weight gain:**  Some individuals experience weight gain while taking repaglinide.
* **Upper respiratory tract infections:** Increased susceptibility to common colds and other upper respiratory infections.
* **Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea:** Gastrointestinal issues can occur.
* **Headache:**  Headaches are a relatively common side effect.


**How it Works:** Repaglinide works by stimulating the beta cells in the pancreas to release more insulin.  This increase in insulin helps the body use glucose (sugar) for energy and lower blood sugar levels.  The effect is dependent on the presence of glucose; it doesn't stimulate insulin release when blood sugar is low, minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia (though it doesn't eliminate it).  The effect is relatively short-lived, requiring administration before meals.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take repaglinide with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.  Interactions can occur with certain medications, particularly those affecting liver function or those that can also lower blood sugar.
* **Q: How often should I check my blood sugar?** A: Your doctor will recommend a blood sugar monitoring schedule.  Frequent monitoring is essential, especially when starting repaglinide, adjusting dosages, or experiencing symptoms of hypoglycemia.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not take a double dose.  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, but only if it's still close to mealtime.  Skip the missed dose if it's almost time for your next meal.
* **Q: What are the long-term risks of taking repaglinide?** A:  Long-term use can increase the risk of hypoglycemia and potentially weight gain.  Regular monitoring by your doctor is crucial to manage these risks.  Also, there's some evidence suggesting increased cardiovascular risk, but more research is needed.
* **Q: Can I stop taking repaglinide suddenly?** A:  No, you should never stop taking repaglinide suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to uncontrolled blood sugar levels and potentially serious health complications.  Your doctor will help you gradually reduce your dose if necessary.
* **Q: Is repaglinide suitable for everyone with type 2 diabetes?** A: No, repaglinide is not appropriate for everyone with type 2 diabetes.  Your doctor will assess your overall health and diabetes management needs to determine if itâ€™s the right medication for you.  It's often not the first-line treatment and might be unsuitable for individuals with certain health conditions, such as severe kidney or liver disease.
