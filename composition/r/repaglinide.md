# Repaglinide
### Generic Name
Repaglinide

### Usage
Repaglinide is a medication used to manage type 2 diabetes in adults.  It's specifically employed as an adjunct to diet and exercise, meaning it works best when combined with lifestyle changes aimed at improving blood sugar control.  Repaglinide helps lower blood glucose levels, but it's crucial to understand that it's *not* used for type 1 diabetes or to treat diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious complication of diabetes).  Its primary role is to improve glycemic control (blood sugar regulation) in adults already making efforts to manage their type 2 diabetes through diet and exercise.

### Dosage
Dosage is individualized and depends on the patient's HbA1c level (a measure of long-term blood sugar control) and response to treatment.  Repaglinide is taken orally, usually 30 minutes before meals.

* **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Adults):**
    * **Starting Dose:** For HbA1c < 8%, the starting dose is typically 0.5 mg before each meal. For HbA1c ≥ 8%, the starting dose may be 1 or 2 mg before each meal.
    * **Dose Range:**  0.5-4 mg per meal.
    * **Maximum Daily Dose:** 16 mg/day.
    * **Titration:**  The dose may be increased gradually, usually in increments of 1 mg per meal, until adequate blood sugar control is achieved, with at least one week between adjustments to monitor the response. The number of times the medication is taken daily (2, 3, or 4 times) depends on the patient's meal schedule. Importantly, if a meal is skipped, the corresponding dose of Repaglinide should also be skipped to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).
    * **Hypoglycemia:** If hypoglycemia occurs, the dose should be reduced.


* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Repaglinide in children have not been established.

* **Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.  Specific guidelines are provided by the manufacturer’s labeling based on creatinine clearance (CrCl), a measure of kidney function.  Moreover, the concomitant use of certain other medications may also require dosage adjustments due to potential drug interactions. Consult a healthcare provider before making any changes.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in >10% of patients) include headache and upper respiratory tract infections. Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is also a significant potential side effect and requires careful monitoring.  Less common but potentially serious side effects include cardiovascular events (e.g., chest pain, ischemia), gastrointestinal issues (diarrhea, constipation), hypersensitivity reactions, and various other rarer adverse reactions listed in the detailed product information.  Consult a healthcare professional immediately if any concerning side effects occur.

* **Common (>10%):** Headache, upper respiratory tract infection, hypoglycemia
* **Less Common (1-10%):**  Ischemia, chest pain, sinusitis, bronchitis, diarrhea, constipation, hypersensitivity reaction, back pain, arthralgia, urinary tract infection.
* **Rare (<1%):** Alopecia, anaphylactoid reaction, blurred vision, cardiac arrhythmia, ECG abnormality, hemolytic anemia, severe hepatic insufficiency, hepatitis, hypertension, increased liver enzymes, jaundice, leukopenia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, thrombocytopenia, transient visual disturbance, myocardial infarction, palpitations, pancreatitis.


### How it Works
Repaglinide works by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas.  This effect is dependent on the presence of functioning beta-cells in the pancreas, which are responsible for insulin production.  The medication does so by closing certain potassium channels in the beta-cell membranes.  This action leads to depolarization of the beta-cells, triggering the influx of calcium ions and, consequently, the release of insulin.  The increased insulin levels help lower blood glucose levels. This mechanism is highly selective for the pancreatic beta-cells and minimally affects other tissues.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Repaglinide is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the medication, those with diabetic ketoacidosis, type 1 diabetes, severe hepatic impairment, and those concurrently taking gemfibrozil or clopidogrel.

* **Drug Interactions:** Repaglinide interacts with numerous drugs, including corticosteroids, CYP2C9 inducers and inhibitors, diuretics, other hypoglycemic agents, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues, MAO inhibitors, NSAIDs, and SSRIs. These interactions can either reduce or increase Repaglinide's effectiveness or lead to increased risk of side effects. Close monitoring and potential dosage adjustments are often required when Repaglinide is used with other medications.

* **Special Populations:**  Caution is advised in patients with hepatic or severe renal impairment, pregnant women (Category C pregnancy risk), and breastfeeding mothers (not recommended due to potential hypoglycemia in the infant).

* **Warnings:**  Repaglinide can increase the risk of hypoglycemia, particularly if a meal is missed after taking the medication.  The risk of serious cardiovascular adverse reactions is heightened when Repaglinide is used concomitantly with NPH insulin.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take for Repaglinide to work?** A: Repaglinide typically starts working within 30 minutes of ingestion.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Repaglinide suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping Repaglinide can lead to uncontrolled blood sugar.  Always consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: How should I store Repaglinide?** A: Store Repaglinide at room temperature, away from moisture and heat, as per the directions on the label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose as scheduled. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: What are the symptoms of hypoglycemia, and what should I do if I experience them?** A: Symptoms of hypoglycemia include sweating, trembling, dizziness, confusion, and rapid heartbeat.  If you experience these, consume a fast-acting carbohydrate source (e.g., glucose tablets, juice) and check your blood sugar level. Contact your healthcare provider if symptoms persist.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Repaglinide?** A: Alcohol can affect blood sugar levels and should be consumed in moderation, if at all, while taking Repaglinide. Consult your doctor for guidance.
