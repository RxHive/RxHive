# Raloxifene
### Generic Name
Raloxifene

### Usage

Raloxifene is primarily used to treat and prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.  Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by weakened bones, increasing the risk of fractures. Raloxifene helps increase bone mineral density (BMD), making bones stronger and less prone to breaking.

A secondary, significant use of raloxifene is to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer. This is particularly relevant for postmenopausal women who already have osteoporosis or are at a high risk of developing breast cancer.  It's important to note that raloxifene does *not* treat existing breast cancer; it's a preventative measure.

### Dosage

The standard dose for adults is 60 mg orally once daily. This applies to both the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and the reduction of invasive breast cancer risk.  The optimal duration of treatment for breast cancer risk reduction in women with osteoporosis is not definitively known.  For breast cancer prevention in high-risk women without osteoporosis, the recommended duration is typically five years.

**Pediatric use:** The safety and effectiveness of raloxifene in children have not been established.

**Dosage adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment; however, use in these patient populations requires caution and close monitoring by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

**Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Flu-like symptoms
* Hot flashes
* Infections
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Leg cramps
* Muscle spasms


**Less common but potentially serious side effects (occurring in 1-10% or less, or reported post-marketing):**

* Venous thromboembolism (blood clots in veins, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism)  This is a serious side effect and requires immediate medical attention.
* Stroke
* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Breast abnormalities
* Hypertriglyceridemia (high levels of triglycerides in the blood)
* Unexplained uterine bleeding
* Other side effects like insomnia, chest pain, various gastrointestinal issues, skin rashes, and others can occur.


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above as potentially serious, consult your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).  This means it acts like estrogen in some parts of the body and blocks estrogen's effects in others.  In bone tissue, it acts as an estrogen agonist, increasing bone mineral density and reducing bone loss, thereby strengthening bones. In breast tissue, it acts as an antagonist, blocking estrogen's action and reducing the risk of breast cancer.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Raloxifene is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with a history of or current venous thromboembolic disorders (blood clots), and in pregnant women.  It is also not recommended for women of childbearing potential.

**Interactions:** Raloxifene can interact with certain medications, such as cholestyramine (a medication used to lower cholesterol) and warfarin (a blood thinner). Concomitant use should be avoided or closely monitored by a healthcare provider.

**Warnings:**  Raloxifene increases the risk of venous thromboembolism and stroke.  Patients should be carefully monitored for these risks.  Unexplained uterine bleeding should be investigated promptly. Women at increased risk for cardiovascular events or stroke should carefully discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors before starting raloxifene.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take raloxifene with other medications?**
A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking before starting raloxifene, as interactions are possible.

**Q: How should I store raloxifene?**
A: Store raloxifene as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.

**Q:  Is raloxifene safe for long-term use?**
A: The long-term safety of raloxifene is an ongoing area of research.  Your doctor will assess your individual risks and benefits for continued treatment.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

**Q: Can I stop taking raloxifene abruptly?**
A:  Generally, it's best not to stop taking raloxifene abruptly. Consult your doctor before stopping treatment to ensure a safe and appropriate discontinuation plan.  Stopping abruptly may not be associated with withdrawal symptoms, but it is always best to consult your doctor.
