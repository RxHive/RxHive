# Rufinamide
### Generic Name
Rufinamide

### Usage
Rufinamide is an anticonvulsant medication primarily used as an adjunctive therapy for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS).  LGS is a severe form of epilepsy characterized by multiple types of seizures, intellectual disability, and developmental delays.  Rufinamide is added to other anti-seizure medications already being taken to help better control seizures that are not adequately managed by those initial treatments alone. It's important to understand that rufinamide is not a first-line treatment for epilepsy; it's used when other options haven't been fully effective.


### Dosage

**Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome:**

* **Adults:** The usual starting dose is 400-800 mg per day, divided into two equal doses.  The dose can be increased by 400-800 mg every other day, as tolerated, up to a maximum of 3200 mg per day, again divided into two doses.

* **Children (1 to <17 years):** The starting dose is typically 10 mg/kg/day divided into two equal doses. This dose is carefully increased in increments of approximately 10 mg/kg every other day, until a target dose of 45 mg/kg/day is reached (also in two divided doses). The maximum dose remains 3200 mg/day.  The safety and effectiveness of rufinamide in children under 1 year old have not been established.  Dosage adjustments are based on the child's weight and clinical response.

* **Adolescents (â‰¥17 years):**  Follow the adult dosage guidelines.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate liver impairment.  It's generally not recommended for those with severe liver impairment.

* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is usually needed for patients with reduced kidney function.


**Administration:**  Rufinamide is available as tablets and oral suspension (liquid). Tablets can be swallowed whole, broken in half, or crushed. The oral suspension should be shaken well before each dose and administered using the provided measuring device.  It's recommended to take rufinamide with food.

### How it Works

Rufinamide's exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood. However, it's known to be an anticonvulsant that works by affecting the sodium channels in nerve cells.  These channels play a key role in the electrical signals that trigger seizures. By modifying the activity of these channels, rufinamide helps reduce the abnormal electrical activity in the brain responsible for seizures.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Rufinamide is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug or its components, and those with familial short QT syndrome (a heart condition).

* **Interactions:**  Rufinamide can interact with several other drugs, including some hormonal contraceptives, and potentially decreasing their effectiveness.  It's important to disclose all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, to your doctor.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Rufinamide is classified as a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its effects on the fetus are not fully known. The decision to use rufinamide during pregnancy should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider after carefully weighing the risks and benefits. It's unknown whether rufinamide is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding decisions should be made cautiously considering the potential risk to the infant.

* **Other Precautions:** Rufinamide may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior.  Close monitoring for these symptoms is crucial.  It can also affect heart rhythm; patients with pre-existing heart conditions should be monitored carefully.  Sudden cessation of rufinamide may lead to increased seizure activity; gradual withdrawal under medical supervision is recommended.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive while taking rufinamide?** A:  Rufinamide can cause drowsiness and dizziness. Do not operate machinery or drive until you know how this medication affects you.

* **Q: How should I store rufinamide?** A: Store tablets and oral suspension as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
