# Repaglinide + Metformin

**Generic Name:** Repaglinide and Metformin

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat type 2 diabetes.  It's prescribed when diet, exercise, and metformin alone are not enough to control blood sugar levels. Repaglinide stimulates the pancreas to release more insulin, while metformin helps the body use insulin more effectively and decreases glucose production by the liver.  The combination provides a dual approach to blood sugar management.  This medication is *not* used for type 1 diabetes.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **From Repaglinide:** Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar – symptoms include dizziness, sweating, shakiness, hunger, confusion), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight gain.  Rarely, serious allergic reactions can occur.
* **From Metformin:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, metallic taste, vitamin B12 deficiency (long-term use), lactic acidosis (rare but serious – symptoms include muscle pain, weakness, unusual tiredness, difficulty breathing).

It's crucial to report any significant or persistent side effects to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

* **Repaglinide:** This is a meglitinide. It works by stimulating the beta cells in the pancreas to release more insulin when blood glucose levels are elevated.  Its effect is relatively short-lived, meaning it primarily works to control post-meal blood sugar spikes.

* **Metformin:** This is a biguanide. It works through multiple mechanisms:
    * Decreasing the amount of glucose produced by the liver.
    * Increasing the body's sensitivity to insulin (improving how the body uses insulin).
    * Reducing glucose absorption in the intestines.


The combination of repaglinide and metformin provides a more comprehensive approach to managing blood sugar than either drug alone, addressing both insulin secretion and insulin action.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Alcohol can increase the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and lactic acidosis (with metformin).  Limit alcohol consumption and discuss it with your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No. Stopping abruptly can lead to uncontrolled blood sugar levels.  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: What are the signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)?** A: Symptoms include sweating, shakiness, dizziness, confusion, hunger, and weakness. If you experience these, check your blood sugar and treat accordingly (usually with fast-acting carbohydrates).

* **Q: What are the signs of lactic acidosis?** A: This is a rare but serious complication. Symptoms include muscle pain, weakness, unusual tiredness, difficulty breathing, and abdominal pain.  Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect lactic acidosis.

* **Q:  Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, many drugs can interact with repaglinide and metformin.  Inform your doctor of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal supplements) you are taking.
