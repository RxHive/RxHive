# Rabies Immunoglobulin  (Human) (HR Ig)
### Generic Name
Rabies Immunoglobulin (Human) (HR Ig)

### Usage
Rabies Immunoglobulin (Human) (HR Ig) is a crucial part of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for individuals suspected of having been exposed to rabies.  It's not a standalone treatment; it's always used in conjunction with the rabies vaccine.  HR Ig provides immediate, passive immunity—meaning it delivers pre-made antibodies—to help protect against the rabies virus while the body develops its own active immunity through the vaccine.  This temporary protection is vital in the critical period following exposure.  HR Ig is not recommended for individuals with documented proof of complete rabies vaccination and a confirmed antibody response.

### Dosage

**Postexposure Prophylaxis (PEP) for Rabies:**

* **Adults and Children:** The recommended dose is 20 IU/kg of body weight.  The administration method involves a combination of local wound infiltration and intramuscular (IM) injection.  The goal is to infiltrate as much of the HR Ig as possible directly into and around the wound site to neutralize the virus at its point of entry.  If the total dose cannot be infiltrated into the wound, the remaining amount should be given as a deep IM injection in a location separate from the rabies vaccine injection site.  To ensure thorough infiltration into larger wounds, HR Ig may be diluted with sterile saline (2-3 fold dilution).

* **Administration:**  The HR Ig should ideally be administered concurrently with the first dose of the rabies vaccine, but no more than 7 days after the vaccine administration.

* **Forms:**  HR Ig is typically available as a solution for injection.


### Side Effects

The following side effects have been reported with HR Ig. Note that the frequency may vary:

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Pain at the injection site
* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Injection-site nodule
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Nasal congestion
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Oropharyngeal pain


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema)
*  Nephrotic syndrome
*  Skin rash
* Hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells)
* Thrombosis (blood clot formation)
* Malaise


If you experience any significant or concerning side effects after receiving HR Ig, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

HR Ig contains high concentrations of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies obtained from the plasma of human donors who have been immunized against rabies. When administered, these antibodies immediately bind to and neutralize the rabies virus, preventing it from infecting nerve cells. This provides immediate passive protection while the body's immune system begins to produce its own antibodies in response to the rabies vaccine.  Essentially, HR Ig acts as a temporary shield, giving the vaccine time to generate lasting immunity.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  HR Ig should not be given to patients who have already completed a full course of rabies vaccination and have documented evidence of adequate antibody response.  Repeat doses of HR Ig should be avoided after initiating rabies vaccine treatment.

* **Interactions:** Concurrent use with immunosuppressants may reduce the vaccine's effectiveness.  Live vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, polio) should not be administered within 3 months of HR Ig administration.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While pregnancy is not a contraindication to PEP,  HR Ig is classified as Category C by the FDA.  It's excreted in breast milk, so a healthcare provider should consider the risks and benefits for both mother and infant.

* **Hypersensitivity:** Patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to human immunoglobulins should be carefully monitored.

* **Bleeding Disorders:**  Use caution in patients with bleeding disorders or those on anticoagulants.

* **Thrombosis Risk:**  Patients with increased risk of thrombosis should be closely monitored.


### FAQs

* **Q:  How long does the protection from HR Ig last?**  A: The protection provided by HR Ig is temporary; it wanes as the antibodies are gradually broken down by the body.  The rabies vaccine is the primary source of long-term protection.

* **Q:  Can I get the HR Ig and vaccine at the same time?** A: Yes, this is the recommended approach for optimal protection.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?**  A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning symptoms after receiving HR Ig.

* **Q: How is HR Ig stored?** A: HR Ig should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually refrigerated.

* **Q:  Is HR Ig safe for children?** A: HR Ig is used in children as part of rabies PEP, with the dosage adjusted according to weight.

* **Q:  What if I’ve already had a rabies vaccine before?** A: If you have had a complete course of pre-exposure rabies vaccination, and there is documentation showing sufficient antibody response, you may not need HR Ig. Consult with your healthcare provider to assess your individual situation.
