# Ranolazine
### Generic Name
Ranolazine

### Usage
Ranolazine is primarily used to treat chronic angina pectoris, a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It's particularly helpful for patients who experience angina despite taking other standard angina medications like beta-blockers, nitrates, or calcium channel blockers.  While not its primary indication, ranolazine has also been used off-label in the management of ventricular tachycardia, a rapid heartbeat originating from the ventricles of the heart.  It's important to note that ranolazine is not intended for the treatment of acute angina attacks.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For chronic angina, the typical starting dose is 500 mg twice daily (BID). This may be increased to 1000 mg BID based on the patient's response and tolerance, but the maximum recommended dose is 1000 mg BID.  Ranolazine is usually taken orally in tablet form. For off-label use in ventricular tachycardia, the dosage is similar, ranging from 500-1000 mg every 12 hours.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of ranolazine in children have not been established, therefore, it is not recommended for pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic impairment; however, use is contraindicated in those with hepatic cirrhosis. For patients with renal impairment, while no formal dosage adjustment is provided, it's crucial to monitor renal function tests (BUN and creatinine) because ranolazine levels can increase significantly in individuals with reduced kidney function.  Discontinue ranolazine if acute renal failure develops.  Dosage adjustments are also necessary when co-administering ranolazine with certain medications.  Specifically, when used with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as diltiazem, erythromycin, or fluconazole), the ranolazine dose should not exceed 500 mg BID.  When used with P-glycoprotein inhibitors (such as cyclosporine), the ranolazine dose should be titrated based on the patient's clinical response.  Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers is generally contraindicated.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>0.5% - 10%):**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Fatigue
* Nausea
*  Abdominal pain
*  Confusion
* Vertigo
* Syncope
* Bradycardia
* Hypotension
* Palpitations
* Peripheral edema
* Xerostomia (dry mouth)
* Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)
* Blurred vision
* Tinnitus


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<0.5%):**

* QT prolongation (ECG changes) which can potentially lead to Torsades de Pointes (a type of dangerous irregular heartbeat)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Renal failure
* Pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lungs)
*  Pancytopenia (decrease in all types of blood cells)
*  Hypotension

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Ranolazine works by affecting the flow of sodium and calcium ions within the heart muscle cells. This action helps reduce the heart's workload and oxygen consumption, thus lessening the severity of angina symptoms. While the exact mechanism isn't fully understood, it's believed that by selectively inhibiting the late sodium current (INa), it reduces intracellular calcium overload within ischemic cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells affected by lack of oxygen). This ultimately leads to a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand and relief of angina. At higher concentrations, ranolazine also interacts with potassium channels which can prolong the QT interval on an ECG.  


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and those concurrently using strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ranolazine interacts significantly with several medications metabolized by the liver (CYP3A4 pathway) and/or those affected by the P-glycoprotein transporter.  This interaction can either increase or decrease ranolazine levels in the body and/or impact the efficacy and/or levels of co-administered drugs,  potentiating adverse effects. It’s crucial to inform your physician about all other medications being taken.
* **Cardiac Conduction:** Ranolazine can prolong the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), increasing the risk of potentially life-threatening arrhythmias (especially Torsades de Pointes), particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions. Close ECG monitoring is usually recommended.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Patients with reduced kidney function should be closely monitored for signs of worsening renal function.
* **Elderly:**  Elderly patients (≥75 years) may be at increased risk for adverse effects and should be monitored carefully.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ranolazine is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are not fully known.  It should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed and the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  It is unknown whether ranolazine is excreted in human breast milk.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take ranolazine with other heart medications?** A:  Ranolazine can interact significantly with other medications, especially those metabolized by the liver (CYP3A4) and those affected by the P-glycoprotein transporter.  It's essential to discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your doctor before starting ranolazine.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I eat grapefruit while taking ranolazine?** A:  Grapefruit juice should be avoided or significantly limited as it can increase ranolazine levels and increase the risk of side effects.  If grapefruit juice is consumed, the ranolazine dose should not exceed 500 mg BID.

* **Q: How should I store ranolazine?** A: Store ranolazine at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: How long does it take for ranolazine to work?** A: The time it takes to see effects varies depending on the individual and the condition being treated.  It's important to continue taking the medication as prescribed, even if you don't feel immediate relief, and discuss any concerns with your doctor.
