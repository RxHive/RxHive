# Rabies  Vaccine(Chick Embryo Cell PCEV)
### Generic Name
Rabies Vaccine (Chick Embryo Cell PCEV)

### Usage
Rabies purified chick embryo cell vaccine is used to prevent rabies, a deadly viral disease transmitted through the saliva of infected animals, most commonly through bites.  The vaccine is used in two primary scenarios:

* **Pre-exposure prophylaxis:** This involves administering the vaccine to individuals at high risk of rabies exposure, such as veterinarians, animal control officers, and laboratory personnel working with rabies viruses.  This preventative vaccination aims to build immunity *before* potential exposure.

* **Post-exposure prophylaxis:** This is crucial for individuals who have been exposed to rabies, such as through a bite or scratch from a potentially rabid animal.  Post-exposure prophylaxis involves a series of vaccine injections, often combined with rabies immune globulin (RIG), to neutralize the virus and stimulate the immune system to fight off the infection.  The effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis is significantly higher when administered promptly after exposure.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Pre-exposure prophylaxis:** Three 1 mL doses administered intramuscularly (IM) on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28.  A booster dose may be necessary later, determined by antibody titer testing.
* **Post-exposure prophylaxis:** Four 1 mL doses administered IM on days 0, 3, 7, and 14. The first dose should be given as soon as possible after exposure, ideally concurrently with human rabies immune globulin (HRIG).
* **Post-exposure prophylaxis in immunosuppressed patients:** Five 1 mL doses administered IM on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28.  The first dose should be given as soon as possible after exposure, ideally concurrently with HRIG. Immunosuppressant treatment should be deferred if possible.
* **Post-exposure prophylaxis in previously immunized persons:** Two 1 mL doses administered IM on days 0 and 3.  The first dose should be given as soon as possible after exposure.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The dosage for infants and children is the same as for adults.

**Administration:** The vaccine is reconstituted according to manufacturer's instructions before intramuscular injection.  For adults, the deltoid muscle is typically used; for infants and small children, the anterolateral thigh is preferred.  HRIG, if used, is administered separately.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of recipients) may include:

* Injection site pain, soreness, swelling, redness, itching, and burning.
* Nausea and vomiting.
* Abdominal pain.
* Diarrhea.
* Headache.
* Fatigue.
* Enlarged lymph nodes.
* Sore throat.
* Low-grade fever.
* Chills.
* Malaise.
* Muscle aches.
* Dizziness.


Less common but potentially serious side effects may include allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), syncope (fainting), and seizures.  Seek immediate medical attention if any serious adverse effects occur.


### How it Works

The rabies vaccine works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the rabies virus.  These antibodies provide active immunity, protecting against future infections.  Following vaccination, the body learns to recognize and fight the virus quickly and effectively should it encounter it again.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  The vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the vaccine components (e.g., chick embryo cell protein, neomycin, gelatin).  It should not be administered intravascularly, subcutaneously, or intradermally.
* **Use with caution:** The vaccine should be used cautiously in patients with acute illnesses or altered immunocompetence.
* **Interactions:**  Some medications, such as belimumab, can decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine.
* **Pregnancy and lactation:** The vaccine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I receive the rabies vaccine if I'm already sick?** A: It's generally recommended to postpone vaccination until you recover from an acute illness.  Consult your doctor.

* **Q: How long does the protection from the rabies vaccine last?** A: Pre-exposure prophylaxis provides protection for a variable period, requiring antibody titer testing to determine the need for boosters.  Post-exposure prophylaxis aims to provide immediate protection.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Mild side effects are common and typically resolve on their own.  However, if you experience severe or concerning side effects, such as allergic reactions, seek immediate medical attention.

* **Q: How is the vaccine stored?** A:  Store the vaccine according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically under refrigeration.
