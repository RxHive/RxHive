# Rimegepant
### Generic Name
Rimegepant

### Usage
Rimegepant is a medication used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults.  It's important to understand that rimegepant is *not* a preventative medication; it's designed to treat a migraine episode *after* it has started.  It doesn't prevent future migraines from occurring.

### Dosage
The recommended oral dose for adults experiencing a migraine is 75 mg.  This should be taken as needed, but no more than 75 mg should be taken in a 24-hour period.  The safety of using rimegepant to treat more than 15 migraines within a 30-day period hasn't been fully established. Rimegepant is available as an orally disintegrating tablet (ODT).  Use dry hands when handling the ODT, remove it immediately from the blister pack, and place it on or under your tongue; it will dissolve quickly.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for mild or moderate hepatic impairment. However, rimegepant should be avoided in individuals with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is required for mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment.  However, it should be avoided in patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <15 mL/min).
* **Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of rimegepant in children have not been established.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):

* Nausea

Less common side effects (occurring in less than 1% of patients):

* Skin rash
* Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
* Hypersensitivity reactions

Other, less frequently reported side effects include type IV hypersensitivity reactions.  If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Rimegepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist. CGRP is a protein involved in the transmission of pain signals during a migraine. By blocking the CGRP receptor, rimegepant helps to prevent these pain signals from reaching the brain, thus relieving migraine pain. The exact mechanism by which rimegepant achieves this clinical effect is still being researched.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Rimegepant is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to rimegepant or any of its components.  There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including skin rash and shortness of breath.
* **Drug Interactions:** Rimegepant's metabolism can be affected by other medications.  Specifically, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase rimegepant levels, while strong inducers can decrease them, potentially reducing its effectiveness. Similar interactions are possible with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors. Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist before starting rimegepant.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  There is insufficient data on the safety of rimegepant during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Consult your doctor before using rimegepant if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:**  As mentioned above, rimegepant should be used cautiously, or avoided entirely, in individuals with severe liver or kidney disease.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for rimegepant to work?** A: The onset of action varies, but many patients experience relief within a short period after taking it.

* **Q: Can I take rimegepant every day to prevent migraines?** A: No, rimegepant is for the acute treatment of migraines, not for prevention.  It should be taken only when you experience a migraine attack.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Since rimegepant is taken as needed, there is no need to worry about missed doses.  Only take it when you have a migraine.

* **Q: How should I store rimegepant?** A: Store rimegepant at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, according to the instructions provided with your prescription.  Use the orally disintegrating tablet immediately after opening the blister pack.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking rimegepant?** A: While there isn't a specific contraindication with alcohol, it's best to avoid alcohol, especially during a migraine episode, as it can worsen symptoms. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific guidance.
