# Roxithromycin + Ambroxol
### Generic Name
Roxithromycin + Ambroxol


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat respiratory tract infections that involve both bacterial and mucus-related components.  Roxithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, targets a wide range of bacteria commonly causing respiratory infections like bronchitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis. Ambroxol, a mucolytic agent, works to thin and loosen the mucus, making it easier to cough up and clear from the airways.  This combination is particularly effective when a bacterial infection is complicated by excessive mucus production, which is often the case in these types of respiratory illnesses.  It's important to note that this combination is not suitable for all respiratory infections, and a doctor's diagnosis is crucial before starting treatment.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific product formulation, the age and weight of the patient, and the severity of the infection.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  **This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.**

* **Adults (Oral):** The usual dose is one tablet or capsule two to three times daily, typically for 7-10 days.  The exact dosage and duration will be determined by your doctor.

* **Children (Oral):**  Dosage for children is strictly determined by weight and age and should only be administered as directed by a pediatrician.  Syrups or suspensions are commonly used for children.  Never administer adult formulations to children.

* **IV Administration:**  Roxithromycin and Ambroxol are not typically administered intravenously.  Intravenous antibiotics are usually reserved for severe infections where oral medications may not be effective.

**Important Note:** Never alter the dosage or duration of treatment without consulting your doctor.  Completing the full course of medication is essential, even if symptoms improve before the end of the prescribed period, to prevent the recurrence of the infection and the development of antibiotic resistance.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness. These are usually mild and temporary.

* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing),  severe diarrhea (possibly indicating *Clostridium difficile* infection), jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), changes in liver function tests.  If you experience any of these, seek immediate medical attention.

* **Other Possible Side Effects:**  Changes in taste, tinnitus (ringing in the ears),  vaginal yeast infection.


### How it Works

Roxithromycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, effectively stopping the growth and reproduction of bacteria responsible for the infection. This antibiotic action combats the underlying bacterial cause of the respiratory illness.  Ambroxol increases the secretion of fluid into the airways, reducing mucus viscosity (thickness) and promoting its easier expulsion via coughing.  The combined action of the two medications tackles both the bacterial infection and the excessive mucus that often accompanies it, leading to improved breathing and faster recovery.



### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to macrolide antibiotics or ambroxol.  

* **Drug Interactions:**  Roxithromycin can interact with certain medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), ergot alkaloids, theophylline, and some antifungal medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.  Consult your doctor before using it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Liver and Kidney Impairment:** Patients with impaired liver or kidney function may require dosage adjustments.

* **Children:**  Dosage must be strictly followed and determined by a physician.
