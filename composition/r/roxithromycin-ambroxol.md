# Roxithromycin + Ambroxol

**Generic Name:** Roxithromycin + Ambroxol

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat respiratory tract infections, particularly those involving both bacterial and mucus-related components.  Roxithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, targets bacterial infections, while ambroxol, a mucolytic agent, helps thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up.  It's often prescribed for conditions like bronchitis, pneumonia (in some cases, depending on severity and bacterial identification), and other lower respiratory infections where both bacterial infection and excessive mucus are present.  **However, it's crucial to understand that this is not a treatment for all respiratory infections, and a doctor's diagnosis and prescription are essential.**  Self-medicating with this combination can be harmful.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, hives, swelling (angioedema), difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis â€“ a medical emergency).
* **Hepatic:**  Rare cases of liver inflammation (hepatitis).
* **Neurological:** Dizziness, headache.
* **Other:** Changes in taste, vaginal candidiasis (yeast infection).

This is not an exhaustive list, and severe side effects should be reported to a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:**

* **Roxithromycin:** This antibiotic works by binding to the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis and ultimately killing the bacteria. It is effective against a range of Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria.
* **Ambroxol:** This mucolytic agent acts by increasing the secretion of surfactant, a substance that reduces the viscosity (thickness) of mucus. This facilitates easier expectoration (coughing up) of phlegm, clearing the airways.

* **Q: How long should I take this medication?** A: The duration of treatment is determined by a doctor based on the severity of the infection and the patient's response to treatment.  Do not stop taking the medication prematurely, even if you feel better.
