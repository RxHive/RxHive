# Risperidone + Trihexyphenidyl

**Generic Name:** Risperidone and Trihexyphenidyl

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat the extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) that can occur as a side effect of taking risperidone, an antipsychotic medication.  EPS can include symptoms like muscle stiffness, tremors, restlessness (akathisia), and involuntary muscle movements (tardive dyskinesia). Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic drug that helps to counteract these side effects.  **It's important to note that this is not a first-line treatment for psychosis or other conditions where risperidone is prescribed alone.  It is specifically used to manage the EPS caused by risperidone.**  The combination is generally prescribed only when the EPS caused by risperidone are significant and interfering with the patient's functioning.  A doctor will carefully consider the benefits and risks before prescribing this combination.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can include those associated with both risperidone and trihexyphenidyl.  These can be:

* **Risperidone side effects:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, weight gain, increased appetite, constipation, nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, sexual dysfunction,  prolactin elevation (leading to breast enlargement or milk production in women, menstrual irregularities, sexual dysfunction in men), and rarely, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a serious and potentially fatal condition).  Also, increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular problems.

* **Trihexyphenidyl side effects:** Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, memory problems, increased heart rate, widening of the pupils (mydriasis), and decreased sweating.  In older adults, there is a higher risk of cognitive impairment and delirium.

**How it Works:**

* **Risperidone:**  It's an atypical antipsychotic that works by affecting the activity of dopamine and serotonin in the brain.  It helps to manage symptoms of psychosis, but can also cause unwanted effects on dopamine pathways, leading to EPS.

* **Trihexyphenidyl:** It's an anticholinergic agent.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in muscle movement. By reducing the activity of acetylcholine, it helps to counteract the effects of dopamine blockade that causes the EPS associated with risperidone.

**FAQs:**

* **Is this a first-line treatment for psychosis?** No.  Risperidone alone is usually tried first for psychosis. This combination is only used to manage the EPS that *may* occur as a side effect of risperidone.

* **Can I take this combination without a prescription?** No.  This medication should only be taken under the supervision of a doctor.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately.  Some side effects are mild and may subside, but others require medical attention.

* **Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** No.  Stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Are there interactions with other medications?** Yes.  Many medications can interact with risperidone and trihexyphenidyl.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
