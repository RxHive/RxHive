# Relugolix
### Generic Name
Relugolix

### Usage
Relugolix is primarily used to treat advanced prostate cancer.  It works by suppressing the production of testosterone, which is often crucial for the growth of prostate cancer cells.  This reduction in testosterone levels helps to slow or stop the progression of the disease.  While its primary use is in advanced prostate cancer, research is ongoing to explore its potential in other conditions.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Prostate Cancer):** The typical starting dose is 360 mg orally on the first day, followed by 120 mg once daily thereafter.  This is usually given in conjunction with other therapies for advanced prostate cancer.  Specific dosage adjustments are not provided in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment.  Dosage adjustments for severe hepatic impairment or end-stage renal disease haven't been established.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of relugolix in children have not been established.

### How it Works
Relugolix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of GnRH, a hormone that triggers the pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).  LH and FSH are essential for testosterone production in men. By blocking GnRH's action, relugolix significantly reduces testosterone levels, thereby hindering the growth of prostate cancer cells that rely on testosterone for survival and proliferation.


### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Relugolix may cause fetal harm and pregnancy loss. Effective contraception is necessary during treatment and for two weeks after the last dose.  It's unknown whether relugolix is excreted in breast milk.
* **Cardiovascular Disease:** Relugolix may increase the risk of cardiovascular events.  Patients with a history of cardiovascular disease should be closely monitored.
* **Diabetes and Insulin Resistance:** Relugolix may impact blood glucose levels and increase the risk of developing or worsening diabetes.  Regular blood glucose monitoring is recommended.
* **QTc Prolongation:** There's a potential risk of QT interval prolongation, which can lead to potentially fatal heart rhythm problems.  Electrocardiograms (ECGs) may be considered for monitoring.


### FAQs
