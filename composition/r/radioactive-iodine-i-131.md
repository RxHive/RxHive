# Radioactive Iodine (I-131)
### Generic Name
Radioactive Iodine (I-131)

### Usage
Radioactive iodine I-131 (sodium iodide I-131) is primarily used for treating hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and thyroid cancer that absorbs iodine.  It works by destroying thyroid cells.  In advanced thyroid cancer, it can provide palliative care by targeting and reducing the size of iodine-absorbing metastatic lesions.  It also plays a diagnostic role in thyroid function evaluations, via radioactive iodine uptake tests and thyroid imaging.  Off-label uses include treating Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic thyroid adenoma.


### Dosage

Dosage for Radioactive Iodine I-131 is highly individualized and depends heavily on the specific condition being treated, the patient's weight and thyroid size, and the results of prior diagnostic testing.  It's crucial to note that this is a radioactive substance and handling/administration require strict adherence to radiation safety protocols.  The following are examples of dosage ranges, **not recommendations**:

* **Diagnostic Procedures:**  For thyroid uptake tests, 5-10 microcuries (µCi) are typically used; for thyroid imaging, 50-100 µCi.  Whole-body imaging for metastases might use 1-5 millicuries (mCi).  Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on the procedure.

* **Hyperthyroidism Treatment:**  Oral doses generally range from 4-10 mCi.

* **Thyroid Cancer Treatment:**  Ablation of normal thyroid tissue after surgery might involve 30-100 mCi initially, possibly up to 150 mCi for adjuvant therapy. Subsequent ablation of metastases could require 100-200 mCi.

* **Pediatric Dosage:**  Safety and efficacy in children haven't been established,  but off-label use in children over 5 with Graves' disease may involve doses dependent on gland size, exceeding 150 µCi/gram of thyroid tissue.  Always consult with a specialist experienced in pediatric oncology or endocrinology for any pediatric use.


**Administration:** Radioactive iodine I-131 is administered orally.  For optimal absorption, patients should fast for at least 2 hours before and after administration.  The solution needs to be diluted before ingestion.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Sore throat
* Salivary gland swelling
* Dry mouth
* Headache

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid)
* Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)
* Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)
* Bone marrow suppression
* Radiation sickness
* Cerebral edema (in patients with iodine-avid brain metastases)
* Pulmonary fibrosis/pneumonitis (in patients with iodine-avid lung metastases)


**Important:**  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Radioactive iodine I-131 is an isotope of iodine that emits beta radiation.  The body absorbs iodine naturally into the thyroid gland.  Because I-131 behaves similarly to stable iodine, it's taken up by thyroid cells (and potentially metastatic thyroid cancer cells). The emitted beta radiation then destroys these cells, reducing thyroid hormone production in hyperthyroidism and targeting cancerous tissue.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Radioactive iodine I-131 is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.  It's also contraindicated in patients with pre-existing vomiting/diarrhea (for treatment),  those concurrently taking antithyroid medication, and individuals with thyroid malignancies not absorbing iodine (such as medullary or anaplastic carcinomas).

* **Interactions:**   The uptake of I-131 can be affected by prior or concurrent use of stable iodine or thyroid/antithyroid medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications and supplements.

* **Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, radiation-induced thyroiditis and toxicities (potentially fatal), and changes in thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.  Patients must be closely monitored for these issues.  This therapy may cause transient infertility.

* **Special Populations:**  Use in children is off-label and requires expert consultation.  Patients with renal or hepatic impairment need careful consideration.

* **Radiation Safety:** Strict adherence to radiation safety protocols is mandatory for both patient and healthcare personnel.  Post-treatment instructions are crucial to minimize radiation exposure to others.  


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effects of I-131 therapy vary; improvements in hyperthyroidism might be seen in weeks to months, while cancer treatment may take longer and require multiple doses.

* **Q: What is a low-iodine diet?** A: A low-iodine diet restricts foods high in iodine (iodized salt, seafood, dairy) to enhance the uptake of I-131 by the thyroid.  Your doctor or a registered dietitian will provide specific guidance.

* **Q: How long are the precautions after treatment?** A: Post-treatment precautions regarding radiation safety are usually several weeks to months, as determined by your doctor.

* **Q:  Can I travel after treatment?** A:  Inform airport security about your treatment beforehand; you may need documentation.  Travel recommendations will be provided by your doctor, considering radiation safety.

* **Q:  What if I experience side effects?** A: Report all side effects to your doctor immediately.  Some are manageable, while others might require adjustment of treatment or additional medical intervention.
