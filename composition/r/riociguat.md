# Riociguat
### Generic Name
Riociguat

### Usage
Riociguat is a medication primarily used to treat two serious types of pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs):

* **Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH):** This occurs when blood clots in the lungs don't dissolve completely, leading to persistent blockage of blood flow. Riociguat is used in adults with CTEPH who have either undergone surgery or are unsuitable for surgery.  The goal is to improve exercise capacity and overall functional ability.

* **Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH):** This is a condition where the arteries in the lungs become narrowed and constricted, increasing blood pressure. Riociguat's use in PAH aims to improve exercise capacity, improve the patient's WHO functional class (a measure of disease severity), and delay disease worsening.


### Dosage

**Adults (CTEPH and PAH):**

Riociguat is taken orally (by mouth) three times a day (TID).  The starting dose is typically 1 mg TID, but it may be reduced to 0.5 mg TID in patients at higher risk of low blood pressure (hypotension).  The dose can be gradually increased by 0.5 mg TID every two weeks or more, as tolerated, up to a maximum of 2.5 mg TID,  provided the systolic blood pressure remains above 95 mm Hg and the patient shows no signs of hypotension. If treatment is interrupted for three or more days, the dose needs to be retitrated (started again at the lower dose and gradually increased).  Doctors may consider higher doses (above 2.5 mg TID) in smokers if tolerated, but a dose reduction might be needed if a patient stops smoking.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Riociguat in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is specifically recommended for mild to moderate liver impairment.  However, Riociguat is not recommended for patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).

* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is specifically recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 15 mL/min or higher.  Riociguat is not recommended for those with a CrCl below 15 mL/min or those undergoing dialysis.

* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** If hypotension occurs, the dose should be reduced by 0.5 mg TID.

* **Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs):**  If pulmonary edema occurs, the possibility of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) should be considered.  If PVOD is confirmed, Riociguat should be stopped.

* **Transitioning to/from other medications:**  If switching from sildenafil, stop sildenafil at least 24 hours before starting Riociguat. If switching from tadalafil, stop tadalafil at least 48 hours before starting Riociguat. When switching from Riociguat to a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor like sildenafil or tadalafil, stop Riociguat at least 24 hours prior.


### Side Effects

**Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea

**Less common but potentially serious side effects (occurring in 1-10% or less, but requiring attention):**

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Vomiting
* Gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining)
* Constipation
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Major hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
* Palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat)
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Abdominal distention (swelling of the abdomen)
* Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)
* Epistaxis (nosebleed)
* Nasal congestion


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Riociguat works by stimulating an enzyme called soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC).  This enzyme plays a key role in relaxing and widening blood vessels.  Riociguat enhances the production of cyclic GMP (cGMP), a molecule that promotes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). By relaxing and widening the blood vessels in the lungs, Riociguat reduces pulmonary blood pressure and improves blood flow.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Riociguat is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, during pregnancy, with concomitant use of nitrates or nitric oxide donors, with concomitant use of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, and in pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (PH-IIP).

* **Interactions:**  Using Riociguat with PDE inhibitors (like sildenafil or tadalafil) or nitrates can cause severe hypotension.  Interaction with certain strong CYP and P-glycoprotein/breast cancer resistance protein (P-GP/BCRP) inhibitors or inducers may also affect Riociguat levels. Antacids can reduce Riociguat absorption.

* **Pregnancy:** Riociguat is a Category X drug, meaning it is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of serious birth defects. Women of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy tests before starting, monthly during treatment, and one month after stopping. Effective contraception is essential.

* **Breastfeeding:**  It is not known whether Riociguat is excreted in breast milk; therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended.

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Use caution in patients with impaired liver or kidney function.  Severe hepatic or renal impairment may necessitate avoiding Riociguat use altogether.

* **Hypotension and Bleeding Risk:** Patients at risk of hypotension or bleeding should be closely monitored.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Riociguat with other medications?** A:  Discuss all your medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your doctor before starting Riociguat to avoid dangerous interactions, particularly with nitrates, PDE inhibitors, and certain CYP inhibitors or inducers.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Don't double up on doses.  If treatment is interrupted for three days or more, it will need to be restarted at a lower dose.

* **Q: How should I store Riociguat?** A: Store Riociguat as directed by your pharmacist. Generally, it's kept at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  Can I drive or operate machinery while taking Riociguat?** A:  Dizziness and hypotension are possible side effects. Avoid activities requiring alertness until you know how the medication affects you.

* **Q:  What if I experience serious side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or concerning side effects.
