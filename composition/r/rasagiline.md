# Rasagiline

**Generic Name:** Rasagiline

**Usage:**

Rasagiline is used to treat Parkinson's disease.  It's typically used in combination with levodopa (another Parkinson's medication) to improve motor symptoms like tremor, rigidity, slow movement (bradykinesia), and muscle stiffness.  It may also be used alone in early-stage Parkinson's disease.  It's important to note that rasagiline does *not* cure Parkinson's disease; it only helps manage its symptoms.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Nausea:** This is a relatively frequent side effect, especially at the beginning of treatment.
* **Headache:**  A common, typically mild, side effect.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping.
* **Dizziness:** Can lead to falls; caution is advised, especially in the elderly.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty with bowel movements.
* **Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing):** This can cause lightheadedness or fainting.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Serotonin syndrome:** A potentially life-threatening condition characterized by agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, muscle rigidity, and fever.  This is more likely if rasagiline is taken with other serotonergic drugs (e.g., certain antidepressants).
* **Liver problems:**  Rare but possible; liver function tests may be monitored during treatment.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:**

Rasagiline is a selective, irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B).  MAO-B is an enzyme that breaks down dopamine in the brain.  By inhibiting MAO-B, rasagiline increases the levels of dopamine available in the brain.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter crucial for movement control, and its depletion is a key feature of Parkinson's disease.  The increased dopamine levels help alleviate the motor symptoms of the disease.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take rasagiline with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions can occur, particularly with other MAO inhibitors, antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs), and certain pain relievers.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never take two doses at once.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The effects of rasagiline may not be immediately noticeable. It can take several weeks to see a significant improvement in symptoms.
* **Can I stop taking rasagiline suddenly?** No, you should gradually reduce the dose under your doctor's supervision to avoid potential withdrawal symptoms.
* **Is rasagiline right for me?**  Only your doctor can determine if rasagiline is appropriate for your specific situation.  They will consider your medical history, other medications you are taking, and the severity of your Parkinson's disease.
