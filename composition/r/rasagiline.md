# Rasagiline
### Generic Name
Rasagiline

### Usage
Rasagiline is primarily used to treat Parkinson's disease.  It's approved for use as a monotherapy (sole treatment) and as an add-on therapy to levodopa (another common Parkinson's medication).  The goal is to improve motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's, such as tremors, rigidity, slow movement (bradykinesia), and postural instability.  While not its primary indication, it may offer some benefit in managing non-motor symptoms in some patients, but this is not consistently proven.

### Dosage
Rasagiline is available as an oral tablet.  Dosage recommendations vary depending on the patient's treatment regimen and response:

* **Parkinson's Disease (Adults):** The typical starting dose is 1 mg once daily.  When used as an add-on to levodopa, the initial dose may be 0.5 mg once daily, which can be increased to 1 mg once daily based on individual tolerability and response. Note that a dose reduction of levodopa may be considered when adding Rasagiline.

* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Rasagiline in children have not been established.

* **Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.  Patients with mild impairment should not exceed 0.5 mg/day, while use is generally not recommended for those with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Renal (kidney) impairment typically doesn't require dosage adjustments, but this should be discussed with a healthcare professional. Concomitant use with CYP1A2 inhibitors such as ciprofloxacin necessitates a reduced dose of 0.5 mg daily.

### How it Works
Rasagiline is a selective, irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). MAO-B is an enzyme that breaks down dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for movement control. By inhibiting MAO-B, Rasagiline increases the levels of dopamine in the brain, thereby alleviating the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Rasagiline is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or its components, those concurrently using other MAO inhibitors (including selective MAO-B inhibitors), meperidine, methadone, propoxyphene, or tramadol (within 14 days of Rasagiline), and those using cyclobenzaprine, dextromethorphan, or St. John's wort.  It is also contraindicated within 10 days of elective surgery.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Rasagiline can interact with numerous other medications, significantly increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition) or other adverse effects.  This includes interactions with  apraclonidine, brimonidine, procarbazine, selegiline, tramadol, dextromethorphan, atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine, bupropion, isocarboxazid, desvenlafaxine, levomilnacipran, dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, ephedrine, fentanyl, meperidine, methadone, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, and pseudoephedrine.  Discuss all medications and supplements with your doctor before starting Rasagiline.
* **Warnings:** Patients should be aware of the increased risk of melanoma, falling asleep during daily activities, hypertension, serotonin syndrome, hypotension/orthostatic hypotension, dyskinesia, hallucinations/psychotic-like behavior, impulse control/compulsive behaviors, and withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion.  Rasagiline should be used with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before using this medication.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Rasagiline with food?** A: No special dietary instructions are needed; it can be taken with or without food.  However, patients should avoid foods high in tyramine (aged cheeses, certain meats, etc.) due to potential interactions.

* **Q: How should I store Rasagiline?** A: Store Rasagiline at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Rasagiline suddenly?** A:  No, abrupt discontinuation should be avoided as it may lead to a withdrawal syndrome.  Always consult your doctor before stopping treatment.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Rasagiline?** A:  Consult your doctor. Alcohol can interact with many medications, and the combined effects with Rasagiline are not fully known.
