# Racecadotril + Saccharomyces boulardii + Lactobacillus
### Generic Name: Racecadotril + *Saccharomyces boulardii* + *Lactobacillus* (Combination)

**Note:**  This combination is not a standard, pre-approved fixed-dose combination available in all markets.  The use of racecadotril with *Saccharomyces boulardii* and *Lactobacillus* is often seen in clinical practice as a synergistic approach for managing certain gastrointestinal conditions, but the specific formulation and ratios may vary.  Always consult a healthcare professional for accurate prescribing information and dosage.  This information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.


### Usage

This combination therapy is primarily used to treat acute diarrhea, particularly diarrhea associated with infectious causes.  The individual components contribute to its effectiveness in different ways:

* **Racecadotril:** This is an antidiarrheal drug that works by inhibiting enkephalinase, an enzyme that breaks down enkephalins. Enkephalins are natural substances that help regulate intestinal motility. By inhibiting enkephalinase, racecadotril helps reduce intestinal contractions and slows down bowel movements, thus decreasing the frequency and volume of stools.

* **Saccharomyces boulardii:** This is a non-pathogenic yeast that acts as a probiotic. It helps restore the balance of gut flora, competing with harmful bacteria and reducing inflammation in the gut. This can help shorten the duration of diarrhea and improve symptoms.

* **Lactobacillus:** These are beneficial bacteria (also probiotics) that contribute to the healthy gut microbiome. They aid in digestion, produce substances that inhibit harmful bacteria, and may improve overall gut health, reducing the severity and duration of diarrhea.


The combination of these three agents aims to offer a multi-pronged approach to managing diarrhea by addressing both the symptomatic relief (Racecadotril) and the underlying imbalance of gut flora (*Saccharomyces boulardii* and *Lactobacillus*).


### Dosage

Dosage information for this specific combination is unavailable as it's not a standardized formulation. The dosage of each component would be determined by a healthcare professional based on the patient's age, weight, the severity of the diarrhea, and other clinical factors.  Individual dosages for each component would need to be determined based on the specific product being used.  Always refer to the prescribing information accompanying the specific product.  Typically, Racecadotril would be administered orally, while *Saccharomyces boulardii* and *Lactobacillus* would be given orally as capsules or sachets.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (may vary depending on the specific products and dosages):**

* Nausea
* Abdominal discomfort
* Headache
* Constipation (more likely with Racecadotril)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) â€“ Seek immediate medical attention
* Intestinal obstruction (especially in individuals predisposed)
* Worsening of existing gastrointestinal conditions


It is crucial to inform your doctor about any side effects you experience.


### How it Works

As explained in the "Usage" section, each component works through different mechanisms: Racecadotril reduces intestinal motility, while *Saccharomyces boulardii* and *Lactobacillus* restore gut flora balance. The combination provides both symptomatic relief and addresses the underlying cause of diarrhea in many cases.



### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Racecadotril should be avoided in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug.  *Saccharomyces boulardii* and *Lactobacillus* are generally well-tolerated but should be avoided by those with compromised immune systems (e.g., individuals with severe immunodeficiency or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy).
* **Drug Interactions:** Racecadotril might interact with other medications; inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a healthcare professional to assess the risks and benefits.
