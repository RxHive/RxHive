# Rosehip + Collagen Peptide + Sodium Hyaluronate + Chondroitin + Vitamin C

**Generic Name:**  Rosehip Extract + Collagen Peptides + Sodium Hyaluronate + Chondroitin Sulfate + Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)


**Usage:**  This combination is commonly used topically (in creams, serums, or lotions) and sometimes orally (in capsules or powders) for its purported benefits in skin health, joint health, and overall well-being.  Topical application aims to improve skin hydration, reduce wrinkles, and enhance skin elasticity. Oral ingestion is often promoted for joint support and reduced inflammation.  Specific usage instructions will vary depending on the product formulation and manufacturer's recommendations.


**Side Effects:**

* **Topical:**  Generally well-tolerated, but some individuals may experience mild irritation, redness, or itching. Allergic reactions are possible, although rare.  Always perform a patch test before widespread application, especially if you have sensitive skin.
* **Oral:**  Generally well-tolerated at recommended dosages. However, potential side effects may include digestive upset (nausea, diarrhea, constipation), mild headache, or allergic reactions in susceptible individuals.  High doses of Vitamin C can cause diarrhea.  Interactions with certain medications are possible; consult a doctor if you are taking any medications.


**How it Works:**

* **Rosehip Extract:** Rich in antioxidants (vitamin C, carotenoids) and fatty acids, it helps protect against free radical damage, promotes collagen production, and may reduce inflammation.
* **Collagen Peptides:** Provide the building blocks for collagen synthesis, which is crucial for skin elasticity, joint cartilage, and overall connective tissue health.
* **Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid):**  A humectant that attracts and retains moisture in the skin, leading to improved hydration and reduced wrinkles. It also plays a role in joint lubrication.
* **Chondroitin Sulfate:** A glycosaminoglycan found naturally in cartilage, it helps maintain cartilage structure and function, potentially reducing joint pain and stiffness.
* **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid):**  A potent antioxidant that supports collagen synthesis, protects against free radical damage, and enhances the absorption of other nutrients.
