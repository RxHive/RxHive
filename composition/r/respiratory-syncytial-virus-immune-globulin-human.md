# Respiratory Syncytial Virus Immune Globulin, Human
### Generic Name
Respiratory Syncytial Virus Immune Globulin, Human

### Usage
Respiratory Syncytial Virus Immune Globulin, Human (RSV-IGIV) was a medication used to prevent severe lower respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in high-risk infants.  Specifically, it was primarily used for children younger than 24 months who had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (a chronic lung disease often seen in premature babies) or a history of premature birth.  These infants are particularly vulnerable to severe RSV infections, which can lead to serious complications.  It's important to note that this medication is no longer commercially available, having been superseded by palivizumab.

### Dosage
Dosage information for RSV-IGIV is not provided here because the medication is no longer available.  Prescribing information was previously available through the manufacturer, but this is no longer relevant.  Healthcare professionals would have followed specific guidelines based on the patient's weight and condition at the time of its use.

### Side Effects
Because RSV-IGIV is no longer available, a comprehensive list of side effects is not actively maintained. However,  like other immunoglobulin products, potential side effects could have included:

*   Mild injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)
*   Fever
*   Headache
*   Muscle aches
*   Rarely, more serious allergic reactions

It is crucial to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and the specific side effects experienced could have varied from person to person.

### How it Works
RSV-IGIV worked by providing passive immunity against RSV.  The medication contained high concentrations of antibodies specifically targeting RSV.  These antibodies directly neutralized the virus, preventing it from infecting the respiratory tract cells and causing illness.  This provided temporary protection to high-risk infants.


### Precautions
Since RSV-IGIV is discontinued, detailed precautions are not readily available. However,  general precautions associated with immunoglobulin products generally include:

*   Allergic reactions:  Individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulin should exercise caution.
*   Interactions with other medications:  While specific interactions with RSV-IGIV are not currently documented,  interactions with other medications are always a possibility with any immunoglobulin.
*   Pregnancy and breastfeeding: The safety of RSV-IGIV during pregnancy and breastfeeding would have been considered on a case-by-case basis by healthcare professionals when the product was available.
*   Older adults: The product was not typically used for older adults.
