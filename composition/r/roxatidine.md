# Roxatidine
### Generic Name
Roxatidine

### Usage
Roxatidine is an H2 receptor antagonist primarily used to treat various conditions affecting the stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract.  Its main applications include treating peptic ulcers (both gastric and duodenal), Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (a rare condition causing excessive stomach acid production), erosive esophagitis (inflammation and damage to the esophagus), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining).  It's also sometimes used as premedication before anesthesia to reduce the risk of acid aspiration.  Finally, it can be used to manage upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the route of administration (oral or intravenous).  Always follow your doctor's prescription.  Examples include:

* **Peptic Ulcer:** 150 mg at bedtime (HS) or 75 mg twice daily (BID) for 4-6 weeks. Maintenance may be 75 mg at bedtime.
* **GERD:** 75 mg BID or 150 mg HS for 6-8 weeks.
* **Gastritis:** 75 mg once daily (OD) in the evening.
* **Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome:** 75 mg BID.
* **Pre-anesthesia:** 75 mg the evening before surgery and repeated 2 hours before anesthesia, or 150 mg the night before surgery.
* **Upper Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage:** 75 mg BID by slow intravenous injection or infusion.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of roxatidine in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children unless specifically prescribed and monitored by a pediatrician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dose adjustments for liver impairment. Use with caution.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary for those with impaired kidney function.  For example, with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 20-50 mL/min, the dose might be reduced to 75 mg at bedtime; with a CrCl of <20 mL/min, it may be reduced to 75 mg every other day.  Always follow your doctor's guidance.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include headache, gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, constipation), and changes in liver enzyme levels.

Less common, but potentially serious side effects may include gynecomastia (breast development in men), alopecia (hair loss), blood dyscrasias (abnormalities in blood cells), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), sleep disturbances, restlessness, dizziness, hypersensitivity reactions, changes in pulse rate, sexual dysfunction, and reduced levels of white blood cells and/or platelets.

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Roxatidine is an H2 receptor antagonist.  It works by blocking the action of histamine at H2 receptors located on the parietal cells in the stomach lining.  Histamine stimulates the production of stomach acid. By blocking these receptors, roxatidine reduces the secretion of stomach acid and pepsin (a digestive enzyme).  This helps to heal ulcers, reduce inflammation, and alleviate symptoms associated with conditions like GERD and gastritis.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Roxatidine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to roxatidine or any component of the formulation, breastfeeding women, those with porphyria (a group of genetic disorders affecting heme production), and those with anuria (absence of urine production).
* **Use with Caution:**  Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in elderly patients.
* **Drug Interactions:** Roxatidine may interact with protease inhibitors, potentially affecting their serum levels. Concomitant use should generally be avoided.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Roxatidine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the risks to the developing fetus are unknown.  It is contraindicated during breastfeeding as it is excreted in breast milk.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for roxatidine to work?** A: The onset of action varies, but symptom relief may start within a few days, with full therapeutic effect taking several weeks.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking roxatidine?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol, as it can irritate the stomach lining and worsen the conditions roxatidine is treating.  Consult your doctor.
* **Q: How should I store roxatidine?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Can I stop taking roxatidine suddenly?** A: No, it's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions on how to stop taking the medication to avoid potential complications.  Sudden cessation might not be recommended.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Never double up on doses.
