# Ribociclib
### Generic Name
Ribociclib

### Usage
Ribociclib is a medication used to treat certain types of breast cancer.  Specifically, it's indicated for use in women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.  This means it targets breast cancers that are fueled by hormones and don't overexpress HER2, a protein that can drive cancer growth.

Ribociclib is always used in combination with other therapies, not on its own.  The most common combinations include:

* **With an aromatase inhibitor:** This combination is used as initial endocrine-based therapy in premenopausal or postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors block the production of estrogen, a hormone that can stimulate the growth of certain breast cancers.

* **With fulvestrant:** This combination is used as initial endocrine-based therapy or after the disease has progressed on previous endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Fulvestrant is another drug that blocks estrogen's effects.


### Dosage

Ribociclib is administered orally as a 200 mg tablet.  The standard dosage for adults is 600 mg (three 200 mg tablets) once daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day rest period. This cycle repeats for a total of 28 days. The treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on factors such as liver and kidney function, and the occurrence of specific side effects (see "Dosage Adjustments" section below).  Children should not use this medication as safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), no dose adjustment is needed.  For moderate or severe impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C), the initial dose should be reduced to 400 mg once daily. Further adjustments depend on liver enzyme levels.

* **Renal Impairment:** For patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m², no dose adjustment is needed. For eGFR of 15 to <30 mL/min/1.73 m², the initial dose should be reduced to 200 mg once daily.  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for end-stage renal disease (ESRD, eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m²).

* **Toxicity Management:** Dose reductions are made based on the severity of side effects, particularly neutropenia (low white blood cell count), QT prolongation (a heart rhythm abnormality), dermatologic toxicity (skin reactions), and interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (lung inflammation).  Specific guidelines for dose adjustments based on the grade of these toxicities are provided in the prescribing information.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Decreased appetite
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Increased liver enzymes

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis
* Heart rhythm problems (QT prolongation)
* Severe neutropenia with fever


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Ribociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 inhibitor. CDK4 and 6 are enzymes involved in cell growth and division. By inhibiting these enzymes, ribociclib slows down the growth of cancer cells, particularly those that are driven by hormones.  When used with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant, which also target hormone signaling pathways, the combined effect is a more potent suppression of tumor growth.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ribociclib is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, and those with untreated congenital long-QT syndrome or a baseline Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) of ≥450 msec.  It should also be avoided in patients at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Ribociclib interacts with several other medications, particularly those metabolized by the CYP3A enzyme system and those that prolong the QT interval. Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers may alter Ribociclib levels significantly. Consult with your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other drugs you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ribociclib can harm a developing fetus. Women of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose.

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are required for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

* **Monitoring:** Regular blood tests and electrocardiograms (ECGs) are necessary to monitor blood cell counts, liver function, and heart rhythm.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Ribociclib with food?** A: Ribociclib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take an extra dose. Take the next scheduled dose at the usual time.

* **Q: How should I store Ribociclib?** A: Store Ribociclib at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Ribociclib?** A: No, avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice, as they can interfere with the drug's metabolism.  Pomegranate should also be avoided.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Ribociclib?** A: Long-term effects vary depending on individual response and are best discussed with your oncologist.

* **Q:  Can Ribociclib cure my breast cancer?** A: Ribociclib is a treatment option that aims to slow or stop the progression of advanced breast cancer. It is not a cure, but it can significantly improve outcomes when used appropriately.
