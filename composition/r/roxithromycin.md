# Roxithromycin

**Generic Name:** Roxithromycin

**Usage:** Roxithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Respiratory tract infections:**  Such as bronchitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis.
* **Skin and soft tissue infections:**  Including impetigo, cellulitis, and erysipelas.
* **Genital infections:**  Specifically, infections caused by susceptible bacteria (e.g., certain strains of *Chlamydia trachomatis*).
* **Other infections:**  Depending on susceptibility testing, it may be used for other bacterial infections.

**Note:**  The specific infections treated and dosage will be determined by a healthcare professional based on the individual's condition and the bacteria causing the infection.  Roxithromycin is not effective against viral infections.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, roxithromycin can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives.  In rare cases, serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) can occur.
* **Hepatotoxicity:**  (Liver damage) â€“ although rare, liver function tests may be recommended, particularly with prolonged use.
* **Hearing problems:**  Temporary hearing loss has been reported rarely.
* **Changes in taste:**  A metallic taste in the mouth may occur.
* **Headache**
* **Fatigue**

This is not an exhaustive list.  More serious, though rare, side effects can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe allergic reactions, significant abdominal pain, jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes), or changes in hearing.

**How it Works:** Roxithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that works by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria.  This inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, preventing the bacteria from growing and multiplying, ultimately leading to their death.  It is bacteriostatic (slows bacterial growth) at lower concentrations and bactericidal (kills bacteria) at higher concentrations.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take roxithromycin with other medications?**  A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting roxithromycin.  Interactions can occur.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking roxithromycin?** A:  While not explicitly contraindicated with roxithromycin in the same way as some other antibiotics, excessive alcohol consumption can worsen gastrointestinal side effects.  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally advised to be avoided.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific guidance.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for the next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: How long should I take roxithromycin?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the infection and its severity.  Always complete the prescribed course of antibiotics, even if you feel better, to prevent recurrence or the development of antibiotic resistance.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.  They can advise on how to manage them or adjust your treatment.
