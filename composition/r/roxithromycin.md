# Roxithromycin
### Generic Name
Roxithromycin

### Usage

Roxithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic effective against a range of susceptible bacteria.  Its primary use is in treating bacterial infections affecting various parts of the body. This includes:

* **Upper and lower respiratory tract infections:**  Conditions such as pneumonia (community-acquired), sinusitis (sinus infection), and otitis media (middle ear infection).
* **Genital/venereal infections:**  Though specific infections are not listed here,  roxithromycin can be used to treat certain sexually transmitted infections caused by susceptible bacteria.
* **Skin and soft tissue infections:**  This broad category includes infections affecting the skin, such as cellulitis or abscesses, caused by susceptible organisms.
* **Periodontal infection:** Infections affecting the gums and tissues surrounding the teeth.

While not its primary indication, roxithromycin is sometimes used off-label for the prevention of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* infection in individuals with asplenia (absence of a spleen) or hyposplenia (reduced spleen function).  This use is typically reserved for those allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics (like penicillin).  It's crucial to consult with a doctor before using any medication off-label.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the patient's age, weight, and the specific infection being treated. Always follow the prescribed dosage and duration of treatment exactly as directed by a healthcare professional.

**Adults:** For most bacterial infections, the typical oral dosage is 150 mg twice daily (BID) or 300 mg once daily (OD). Treatment usually lasts 5-10 days, but some infections, like non-gonococcal genital infections, may require up to 20 days.  For off-label use in preventing *Streptococcus pneumoniae* infection, the dosage is usually 150 mg once daily.

**Children and Adolescents:** Dosage is determined by weight, typically ranging from 5-8 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses. The maximum daily dose is 150 mg.  Specific weight-based recommendations often are provided by the physician. For off-label *Streptococcus pneumoniae* prevention, the dosage is 4 mg/kg once daily, not exceeding 150 mg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Individuals with mild-to-moderate hepatic (liver) impairment may not require dosage adjustment, but use should be cautious.  Severe hepatic impairment often requires a 50% dose reduction, and in some regions, it is contraindicated.  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult your doctor for guidance if you have liver or kidney issues.

### Side Effects

Roxithromycin, like other antibiotics, can cause various side effects.  Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness

Less common, but more serious side effects, include:

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Liver damage (hepatitis)
* Changes in heart rhythm (QT prolongation, potentially leading to serious arrhythmias)
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
*  Pseudomembranous colitis (a severe bowel infection)


If you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Roxithromycin is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, meaning it inhibits the growth and multiplication of bacteria. It achieves this by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacterial ribosomes.  This prevents bacterial protein synthesis, which is essential for bacterial survival and reproduction.  By halting protein synthesis, the drug effectively stops the infection from spreading.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Roxithromycin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to roxithromycin, other macrolide antibiotics, or any component of the formulation.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with liver problems.
* **Cardiac Conditions:**  Roxithromycin can prolong the QT interval of the heart (on the EKG), potentially leading to serious arrhythmias. Exercise caution in patients with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Drug Interactions:** Roxithromycin may interact with other medications. Consult your doctor about any other medications you are taking, especially those that affect the QT interval, such as certain antiarrhythmics.  Simvastatin use may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis. Avoid concomitant use with ergot alkaloids, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, terfenadine, or mizolastine.  The effectiveness of BCG vaccine can be decreased.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Roxithromycin is a Category B1 drug in Australia.  Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be under strict medical supervision. Excretion in breast milk is possible, and its use while breastfeeding is not recommended.
* **Children:** Use in children should be carefully supervised by a physician.
* **Elderly:**  Use with caution in older adults, monitoring for side effects.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take roxithromycin with food?** A: It's generally recommended to take it 15 minutes before or 3 hours after meals to optimize absorption.  Follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions.

* **Q: How should I store roxithromycin?** A: Store at room temperature and protect from moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is close to the time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking roxithromycin once I feel better?** A:  No.  Complete the entire course of antibiotics prescribed, even if you feel better before finishing.  Stopping early can lead to treatment failure and the development of antibiotic resistance.

* **Q: Is roxithromycin safe for everyone?** A:  Roxithromycin has potential side effects, and not everyone can safely use it. Individuals with certain pre-existing conditions (like liver disease, heart conditions, or allergies) should consult a physician before use.
