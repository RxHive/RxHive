# Rifabutin
### Generic Name
Rifabutin

### Usage
Rifabutin is a type of antibiotic primarily used to prevent disseminated *Mycobacterium avium* complex (MAC) disease in individuals with advanced HIV infection.  MAC is an opportunistic infection that can cause serious illness in people with weakened immune systems. Rifabutin's main role is in preventing this infection from spreading throughout the body.  It's also sometimes used as an alternative to rifampin in treating tuberculosis (TB), both latent and active, particularly in patients with HIV.  However, its use in treating TB is considered off-label in many contexts and requires careful consideration by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  The dosage of Rifabutin varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated and whether other medications are being taken concurrently.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

* **MAC Disease Prevention (Primary Prophylaxis):**  300 mg daily, usually divided into two doses, for patients with a CD4 count below 50 cells/mm³. This is often considered an alternative approach.
* **MAC Disease Prevention (Secondary Prophylaxis):** 300 mg once daily.  This is often used in conjunction with other medications like clarithromycin or azithromycin (plus ethambutol) and may be discontinued after 12 months of treatment if certain criteria are met.
* **MAC Disease Treatment (Off-label):** 300 mg daily, often added to a treatment regimen that includes clarithromycin or azithromycin and ethambutol.
* **Tuberculosis Treatment (Off-label):** Dosage varies depending on whether it's latent or active TB and whether the patient has HIV.  It's usually part of a multi-drug regimen, with doses ranging from 300 mg daily to intermittent dosing (2-3 times per week). The specific regimen and duration will be determined by the healthcare provider.  Active TB in HIV-positive patients can present atypically.
* **Dosage Adjustments:** Rifabutin dosage may need to be adjusted based on liver or kidney function, and especially if the patient is also taking other medications, particularly protease inhibitors or efavirenz (a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor).  Always consult a doctor before adjusting the dose.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  The dosage of Rifabutin for children is calculated based on weight (mg/kg) and varies greatly depending on the condition,  age, and the specific treatment protocol.  A healthcare professional should determine the appropriate pediatric dose, and careful monitoring is required.  Remember, Rifabutin is never given alone for MAC treatment in children; it's always part of a combined therapy.

### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Skin rash
* Discoloration of urine (orange-brown)

**Note:** This list is not exhaustive.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.

### How it Works

Rifabutin is a rifamycin antibiotic. It works by inhibiting bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a crucial enzyme for bacterial RNA synthesis.  By inhibiting this enzyme, rifabutin prevents bacteria from producing essential proteins and therefore halts their growth and replication.  This mechanism is effective against *Mycobacterium avium* complex and some strains of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Rifabutin should not be used by people allergic to it or other rifamycin antibiotics (like rifampin).
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:**  Individuals with severe liver or kidney problems may require dose adjustments.
* **Drug Interactions:** Rifabutin interacts significantly with many other drugs, including some antiretroviral medications, anti-fungal drugs, oral contraceptives, and others. Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Live Vaccines:** Avoid live vaccines while taking Rifabutin.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of Rifabutin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.
* **Alcohol:** Alcohol consumption should be minimized or avoided while taking Rifabutin.
