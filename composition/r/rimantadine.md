# Rimantadine
### Generic Name
Rimantadine

### Usage
Rimantadine is an antiviral medication primarily used to prevent and treat influenza A virus infections.  However, it's crucial to understand that due to widespread resistance among circulating influenza A strains, rimantadine is **no longer a recommended treatment or preventative measure by major health organizations like the CDC.**  Its use is largely obsolete except in very specific circumstances where other antiviral options are unavailable and resistance testing is not feasible.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Because of widespread resistance, the following dosage information is provided for historical context and completeness only.  **Do not use rimantadine to treat or prevent influenza A without explicit direction from a healthcare professional who has considered the current resistance landscape.**

**Adults:**

* **Prophylaxis (Prevention):** 100 mg orally every 12 hours.
* **Treatment:** 100 mg orally every 12 hours, ideally starting within 48 hours of symptom onset.

**Children:**  Dosage for children varies greatly by age and weight and should only be determined and administered by a physician.  Previously recommended guidelines involved calculating the dosage based on weight (mg/kg/day) and dividing it into doses.  However, given the current ineffectiveness, obtaining this information is generally unnecessary.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, modifications may be necessary depending on the individual's condition.  A healthcare provider should determine the appropriate dose in such cases.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Insomnia, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, nervousness, fatigue, headache.
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, dry mouth, abdominal pain.
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Weakness.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Abnormal gait, agitation, altered sense of smell, ataxia (loss of coordination), bronchospasm, heart failure, confusion, cough, depression, diarrhea, drowsiness, altered taste, dyspepsia (indigestion), shortness of breath, euphoria, hallucinations, heart block, hyperkinesia (excessive movement), high blood pressure, lactation (in men or women not breastfeeding), palpitations, pallor (paleness), swelling in the feet, seizures, skin rash, fainting, rapid heartbeat, ringing in the ears, tremor.


If any adverse effects occur, immediately consult a healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Rimantadine belongs to the adamantane antiviral class. It works by interfering with the influenza A virus's ability to enter and replicate within host cells.  Specifically, it inhibits the uncoating process, preventing the virus from releasing its genetic material and initiating infection.  This mechanism targets three influenza A virus subtypes (H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2).

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Rimantadine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to rimantadine, other adamantanes (like amantadine), or any of its components.
* **Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution when using rimantadine in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, those with a history of seizures, and the elderly.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concurrent use with certain drugs, such as tramadol, metrizamide, iopamidol, iohexol, or bupropion, increases the risk of seizures.  Rimantadine might also reduce the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine and interact with MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors).  Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Rimantadine falls under pregnancy category C, meaning its effects on pregnancy are unknown. Breastfeeding is generally not recommended due to the potential for adverse effects on the infant.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take rimantadine with food?** A: Yes, rimantadine can be taken with food.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies, but symptom improvement is generally observed within a few days with treatment. For prevention, effectiveness depends on the timing of administration relative to exposure to the virus.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store rimantadine?** A: Store rimantadine as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Is rimantadine effective against influenza B?** A: No, rimantadine is not effective against influenza B viruses.
* **Q: Why is rimantadine not commonly used anymore?** A: Widespread resistance among influenza A viruses renders rimantadine largely ineffective in many cases.  Newer antiviral drugs are generally preferred for influenza treatment and prevention.
