# Rifapentine
### Generic Name
Rifapentine

### Usage
Rifapentine is a long-acting antibiotic belonging to the rifamycin class. Its primary use is in the treatment of active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), a serious bacterial infection affecting the lungs.  It's always used in combination with other anti-TB drugs, never alone.  A secondary use is in the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), where the bacteria are present but not causing active disease.  In this case, it's also used with other medications to prevent the infection from becoming active.  The specific combination of drugs and the duration of treatment depend on several factors, including the patient's health status and the type of TB infection.

### Dosage

**Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Adults):**

Rifapentine should *never* be used as monotherapy.  It's always part of a multi-drug regimen.

* **Initial Phase (Short-term therapy):** 600 mg twice weekly (with at least 72 hours between doses) under direct observation for 2 months. This phase usually includes 3-4 drugs.  Note that Rifapentine hasn't been studied in HIV-positive individuals with active pulmonary TB during the initial phase.
* **Continuation Phase (Short-term therapy):** 600 mg once weekly under direct observation for 4 months, along with isoniazid or other appropriate drugs.  In HIV-positive patients, once-weekly use in continuation with isoniazid is not recommended due to higher failure/relapse rates with rifampin-resistant organisms.

**Latent Tuberculosis Infection (Adults):**

Active TB must be ruled out before starting LTBI treatment. Rifapentine with isoniazid is not recommended for individuals exposed to rifamycin- or isoniazid-resistant *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

* **Once-weekly regimen:** Dosage varies based on weight:
    * 25.1-32 kg: 600 mg
    * 32.1-50 kg: 750 mg
    * >50 kg: 900 mg
    * Administered for 12 weeks with isoniazid.  Can be self-administered or under direct observation.  *Not recommended for pregnant or potentially pregnant women*.  In HIV-positive patients, consider only if ART drugs have acceptable drug interactions.

* **Once-daily regimen (HIV-infected patients):**  This is not yet widely recommended but is an area of ongoing research. Dosage varies by weight:
    * <35 kg: 300 mg daily
    * 35-45 kg: 450 mg daily
    * >45 kg: 600 mg daily
    * Administered for 1 month with isoniazid.


**Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Children ≥12 years):** Dosage is the same as for adults.

**Latent Tuberculosis Infection (Children ≥2 years):** Dosage is weight-based and administered with isoniazid for 3 months under direct observation or self-administered:
    * 10-14 kg: 300 mg once weekly
    * 14.1-25 kg: 450 mg once weekly
    * 25.1-32 kg: 600 mg once weekly
    * 32.1-50 kg: 750 mg once weekly
    * >50 kg: 900 mg once weekly


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dose adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling for hepatic or renal impairment; use with caution in these cases.

### Side Effects

**Common (≥10%):**

* Hyperuricemia
* Pyuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection
* Neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, anemia

**Less Common (1-10%):**

* Headache, dizziness, fatigue
* Chest pain, edema
* Skin rash, itching, sweating
* Nausea, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST)

**Rare ( <1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**  Many side effects are possible, including serious ones like allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), liver damage (hepatitis), and blood disorders.  A complete list is too extensive to include here.  

**Important:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or concerning side effects.

### How it Works
Rifapentine inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.  This enzyme is essential for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* to produce RNA, a crucial step in protein synthesis and bacterial growth. By blocking this enzyme, rifapentine prevents the bacteria from replicating and ultimately kills them.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity to rifapentine, other rifamycins, or any formulation component.
* **Drug Interactions:** Rifapentine significantly interacts with many other medications, including some contraceptives, antiretrovirals, anticoagulants, and others.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking. A detailed list of interactions is too long to be included here.
* **Warnings:** Rifapentine can cause discoloration of body fluids (urine, tears, sweat, etc.) and tissues (skin, teeth).  It can also increase the risk of liver damage and various allergic reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms).  Use with caution in patients with pre-existing liver problems, and monitor liver function regularly.  It’s not generally recommended during pregnancy due to potential risks.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use with extreme caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Rifapentine?** A: Alcohol can increase the risk of liver damage.  Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.
* **Q: How should I store Rifapentine?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately for guidance. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Will Rifapentine interact with my other medications?** A: Yes, it interacts with many medications.  It's crucial to disclose all your medications to your doctor before starting Rifapentine.
* **Q: Is Rifapentine safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use is possible as part of tuberculosis treatment, but careful monitoring is necessary.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.
