# Raltitrexed
### Generic Name
Raltitrexed

### Usage

Raltitrexed is primarily used in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (cancer of the colon and rectum).  It's an antimetabolite, a type of chemotherapy drug that interferes with the growth and replication of cancer cells. While its primary application is in colorectal cancer, it has also been used off-label in treating malignant pleural mesothelioma (a rare cancer of the lining of the lungs).  The use in mesothelioma is often in combination with other chemotherapy agents.  Always consult with a healthcare professional to determine if raltitrexed is appropriate for a specific cancer type and stage.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The typical dosage for advanced colorectal cancer is 3 mg/m² administered intravenously (IV) once every three weeks. This dosage is adjusted based on several factors, such as renal and hepatic (liver) function.  For malignant pleural mesothelioma, the same dosage (3 mg/m²) is typically used, but it's usually given in conjunction with cisplatin, another chemotherapy drug, until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.  Dosing adjustments are crucial.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of raltitrexed in children have not been established, so it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage modifications are essential based on kidney and liver function. Reduced dosages are recommended for patients with mild-to-moderate renal or hepatic impairment.  Raltitrexed is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment.  Adjustments are also made based on the severity of side effects experienced.  Obese patients' dosing should follow established guidelines for appropriate chemotherapy dosing, often using actual body weight for calculations.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Skin rash
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Abdominal pain
* Constipation
* Mucositis (inflammation of the mucous membranes)
* Stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP)
* Weakness
* Fever

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include:

* Severe bone marrow suppression (leading to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia – low neutrophil and platelet counts)
* Severe gastrointestinal toxicity
* Severe liver or kidney damage
* Cardiac arrhythmias


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, promptly contact your healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Raltitrexed is a folate analogue, meaning it's chemically similar to folic acid (a B vitamin).  It works by selectively inhibiting thymidylate synthase, an enzyme crucial for DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells. By blocking this enzyme, raltitrexed prevents the formation of thymidine, a building block of DNA.  This ultimately leads to impaired DNA synthesis and cell death, primarily affecting cancer cells.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Raltitrexed is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, severe renal or hepatic impairment, pregnancy, breastfeeding, women of childbearing potential, and children.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Raltitrexed interacts with several drugs, including folic acid, leucovorin, and other medications that affect bone marrow or liver function.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Raltitrexed can cause bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal toxicity, and other serious side effects. Close monitoring of blood counts and liver/kidney function is necessary.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid this medication. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and for six months after treatment.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is raltitrexed administered?** A: It's administered intravenously (IV) as an infusion over 15 minutes.
* **Q: How long does treatment last?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the patient's response to therapy and the presence of side effects.
* **Q:  Can I take folic acid or multivitamins while on raltitrexed?** A: No. Folic acid and multivitamins containing folic acid should be avoided during and around the time of raltitrexed administration as they can interfere with its mechanism of action.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately for instructions on how to proceed.
* **Q: How should I store raltitrexed?** A: Follow your doctor or pharmacist's instructions for storage.
