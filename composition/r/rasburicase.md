# Rasburicase
### Generic Name
Rasburicase

### Usage

Rasburicase is a medication primarily used to prevent or treat high levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia) that can occur during cancer treatment, specifically in patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumors.  Chemotherapy can cause the rapid breakdown of cancer cells, releasing large amounts of uric acid into the bloodstream. This can lead to a serious condition called tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which can damage the kidneys. Rasburicase works by breaking down uric acid into a less harmful substance called allantoin, allowing the kidneys to easily remove it from the body.  While its primary use is in the context of cancer treatment, off-label uses may involve managing hyperuricemia in other situations, although this requires careful consideration and guidance from a healthcare professional.  The use of Rasburicase should always be guided by a physician to ensure appropriate management of hyperuricemia in the specific patient context.


### Dosage

Rasburicase is administered intravenously (IV).  Dosage varies depending on the patient's weight, the severity of hyperuricemia, and the risk of TLS.  There's no universally standardized dosage; rather, it is determined on a case-by-case basis based on clinical judgment and serum uric acid levels.

**Adult Dosage:**  Typical doses range from 0.05 mg/kg to 0.2 mg/kg per day for 1-7 days.  Higher doses (0.2 mg/kg daily) may be used in patients at high risk of TLS. The duration of treatment also varies.  Off-label single-dose regimens may also be used.  Always follow the prescribed dosage and schedule given by your doctor.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The dosage for children and adolescents is generally the same as for adults, adjusted based on their weight, but always under close medical supervision.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, close monitoring of kidney function is crucial in all cases, especially in those with pre-existing kidney problems.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Anxiety
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Mucositis (inflammation of the mucous membranes)
* Rash
* Hypophosphatemia (low phosphate levels)
* Hypervolemia (increased blood volume)
* Hyperbilirubinemia (high bilirubin levels)
* Increased serum ALT levels (liver enzyme)
* Fever

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis â€“ a life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells)
* Methemoglobinemia (a condition where hemoglobin is unable to carry oxygen effectively)
* Sepsis (a life-threatening infection)

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme.  It works by converting uric acid, a waste product of purine metabolism, into allantoin.  Allantoin is much more soluble than uric acid, meaning it's more easily excreted by the kidneys.  This reduces the amount of uric acid in the blood, thus preventing or treating hyperuricemia and reducing the risk of TLS.  Importantly, Rasburicase doesn't prevent the production of uric acid; it simply accelerates its breakdown and excretion.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with a history of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity to Rasburicase or its components, a history of hemolytic reactions or methemoglobinemia associated with Rasburicase, and those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.
* **Warnings:**  There is a risk of hemolysis, hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), and methemoglobinemia.  Close monitoring for these complications is essential.
* **Drug Interactions:**  No significant drug interactions are currently known, but it's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Rasburicase is categorized as a pregnancy Category C drug by the FDA, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are unknown. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose.
* **Patients at Risk:**  Patients with pre-existing kidney or liver disease should be carefully monitored.  Adequate hydration is crucial, especially in those at risk for TLS.


### FAQs
