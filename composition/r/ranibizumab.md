# Ranibizumab
### Generic Name
Ranibizumab

### Usage

Ranibizumab is a medication used to treat several serious eye conditions involving abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina.  Its primary use is in treating neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss in older adults.  This medication works by targeting and inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that stimulates the growth of new blood vessels.  The uncontrolled growth of these abnormal blood vessels in wet AMD can cause leakage and bleeding, leading to vision impairment.

Beyond wet AMD, ranibizumab is also indicated for:

* **Macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO):**  RVO occurs when a blood vessel in the retina is blocked, leading to swelling and vision loss. Ranibizumab helps reduce this swelling.
* **Diabetic macular edema (DME):**  DME is a complication of diabetes affecting the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. Ranibizumab helps to reduce swelling and improve vision.
* **Diabetic retinopathy:**  While primarily used for DME, ranibizumab may also be used in some cases of diabetic retinopathy to help manage the effects of abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina.
* **Myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV):** This condition involves abnormal blood vessel growth in the choroid (the layer of tissue beneath the retina) in individuals with high myopia (nearsightedness). Ranibizumab helps to stabilize or reduce the growth of these vessels.


### Dosage

Ranibizumab is administered as an intravitreal injection (directly into the vitreous gel inside the eye) by a qualified ophthalmologist. The dosage varies depending on the specific condition being treated:

* **Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration:** Typically, 0.5 mg is injected once a month (approximately every 28 days).  The frequency may be adjusted after the initial treatment based on the individual patient's response and may be reduced to less frequent injections (e.g., every three months) in some cases.

* **Macular edema following retinal vein occlusion and myopic choroidal neovascularization:**  The usual dose is 0.5 mg once a month.

* **Diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy:** The typical dose is 0.3 mg once a month.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of ranibizumab in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are usually needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, although significant systemic exposure is not expected.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients in some studies):**

* Eye pain
* Conjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding in the conjunctiva, the white part of the eye)
* Increased intraocular pressure (IOP)
* Blurred vision
* Headache
* Foreign body sensation in the eye


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Endophthalmitis (severe eye infection)
* Retinal detachment
* Increased risk of thromboembolic events (blood clots), including stroke
* Allergic reactions


**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list of all possible side effects. If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms after receiving a ranibizumab injection, consult your ophthalmologist immediately.


### How it Works

Ranibizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that specifically targets and binds to vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). VEGF-A is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of new blood vessels. By binding to VEGF-A, ranibizumab prevents it from stimulating the growth of abnormal, leaky blood vessels in the eye.  This reduces swelling, bleeding, and the progression of vision loss associated with the conditions it treats.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ranibizumab is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, active ocular or periocular infection, and active intraocular inflammation.

* **Interactions:** No clinically significant drug interactions have been reported with ranibizumab. However, it's important to inform your ophthalmologist of all medications you are currently taking.

* **Specific Populations:**  Ranibizumab should be used cautiously in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Its safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.

* **Thromboembolic Risk:**  Patients with a history of stroke or other thromboembolic events should be carefully monitored during treatment, as there's a slightly increased risk of such events with ranibizumab.

* **Intraocular Pressure:**  Intraocular pressure should be monitored before and after each injection.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the treatment last?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the individual patient's response and the condition being treated.  It usually involves a series of injections, with the frequency adjusted based on clinical response.

* **Q: How is ranibizumab stored?** A: Ranibizumab should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically refrigerated.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A:  While ranibizumab is generally well-tolerated, long-term effects are still being studied. Regular monitoring by an ophthalmologist is essential.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your ophthalmologist immediately if you experience any concerning side effects after receiving a ranibizumab injection.

* **Q: Is ranibizumab covered by insurance?** A: Coverage may vary depending on your insurance plan and location.  It is best to check with your insurance provider.
