# Ranibizumab

**Generic Name:** Ranibizumab

**Usage:** Ranibizumab is used to treat several eye conditions that cause vision loss due to abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye).  These conditions include:

* **Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD):** The most common use.  This is a leading cause of vision loss in older adults.
* **Macular Edema (ME):** Swelling of the macula, often a complication of diabetes (diabetic macular edema or DME) or retinal vein occlusion (RVO).
* **Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization (mCNV):** Abnormal blood vessel growth in the choroid (the vascular layer underlying the retina) associated with high myopia (nearsightedness).


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, ranibizumab can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Side effects can range from mild to severe and may include:

* **Common Side Effects:** Eye pain, redness, increased eye pressure, blurred vision, eye discharge, floaters, subconjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding under the conjunctiva, the white part of the eye).
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Increased risk of infection (especially endophthalmitis, a serious eye infection), retinal tear or detachment, cataracts, glaucoma, bleeding in the eye, stroke, heart attack.  Allergic reactions are also possible.

**It's crucial to report any changes in vision or any new eye symptoms to your doctor immediately.**

**How it Works:** Ranibizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is a protein that stimulates the growth of new blood vessels. By blocking VEGF, ranibizumab reduces the formation of new, leaky blood vessels in the eye, preventing further vision loss and potentially improving existing vision.  It works by binding to VEGF, preventing it from stimulating blood vessel growth.

**FAQs:**

* **How is ranibizumab administered?**  It's injected directly into the eye (intravitreal injection) by a qualified ophthalmologist.
* **How often is ranibizumab injected?** The frequency of injections varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual patient's response.  It can range from monthly injections to less frequent dosing after an initial treatment phase.
* **How long does treatment last?** Treatment is ongoing and typically requires regular follow-up appointments with an ophthalmologist.
* **Are there any interactions with other medications?**  Your doctor should be informed of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to assess potential interactions.
* **What are the long-term effects?**  Long-term studies are ongoing.  While ranibizumab has been shown to be effective in improving vision and slowing vision loss in many patients,  individual responses can vary. Regular monitoring by an ophthalmologist is essential.
* **Is ranibizumab covered by insurance?** Coverage varies depending on the insurance provider and plan.  Check with your insurance company to determine coverage.
