# Rabies Vaccine (PVRV)
### Generic Name
Rabies Vaccine (Purified Vero-Cell Rabies Vaccine - PVRV)

### Usage
Purified vero-cell rabies vaccine (PVRV) is used to prevent rabies infection.  It's administered both before (pre-exposure prophylaxis) and after (post-exposure prophylaxis) potential exposure to the rabies virus. Pre-exposure vaccination is recommended for individuals at high risk of exposure, such as veterinarians, wildlife handlers, and laboratory personnel working with rabies virus. Post-exposure vaccination is crucial for anyone who has been bitten or scratched by a potentially rabid animal.  The vaccine works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the rabies virus, providing protection against infection.

### Dosage

**Pre-exposure vaccination (for adults and children):**  A series of three 1 mL intramuscular (IM) injections is given on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28.  The interval between doses can be extended without compromising immunity. A booster dose may be recommended based on antibody titers for individuals with continuous or frequent risk of exposure.

**Post-exposure vaccination (for adults):** For individuals previously unimmunized, the regimen consists of four 1 mL IM injections given on days 0, 3, 7, and 14. Immunocompromised individuals may require a fifth dose on day 28. Rabies immune globulin (RIG) is administered with the first dose (day 0).  For individuals previously vaccinated, a two-dose regimen (1 mL IM on days 0 and 3) is sufficient, without RIG.

**Post-exposure vaccination (for children):**  The dosage is the same as for adults (1 mL per dose), administered IM.  The number of doses (four for immunocompetent and five for immunocompromised) and timing remain the same, with RIG given concurrently with the first dose for previously unimmunized children.  Previously vaccinated children receive a two-dose regimen, without RIG.  For infants and young children, the outer aspect of the thigh may be the preferred injection site.  

**Important Note:**  All post-exposure treatment must begin immediately with thorough wound cleansing using soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  Vaccination should commence as soon as possible after exposure.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (frequency >10%):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Malaise
* Injection site pain, swelling, and itching
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Encephalitis (brain inflammation)
* Guillain-Barré syndrome (a rare neurological disorder)
*  Other neurological symptoms (neuritis, paralysis, seizures)
* Serum sickness (immune system reaction)
*  Fever (temperature >38°C)

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.  Even common side effects should be reported to your healthcare provider if they are bothersome or persistent.


### How it Works

PVRV is an inactivated (killed) virus vaccine. It contains the rabies virus, which has been rendered incapable of causing infection. When injected, the vaccine stimulates the body's immune system to produce antibodies specifically targeting the rabies virus. These antibodies provide protection against future infection by neutralizing the virus if exposure occurs.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  PVRV is contraindicated in individuals with a history of life-threatening allergic reaction to rabies vaccine or any of its components (pre-exposure prophylaxis only).
* **Interactions:** Concomitant use with immunosuppressants may reduce the vaccine's effectiveness.  The use of rabies immune globulin (RIG) with the vaccine should be carefully managed to avoid neutralizing the vaccine's effect. RIG should not be mixed in the same syringe with PVRV.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** PVRV is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. While pregnancy is not a contraindication to post-exposure vaccination, pre-exposure vaccination during pregnancy should be considered only if the risk of exposure is very high. The excretion of the vaccine in breast milk is unknown; use with caution during breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  The vaccine is for intramuscular (IM) use only.  Avoid injecting into the gluteal region.  Monitor for anaphylaxis for at least 15 minutes after injection.  Individuals at high risk may require periodic serological testing to monitor antibody levels.

### FAQs

**Q: How long does immunity last after the pre-exposure series?**
A: The duration of immunity varies, but booster doses may be necessary for individuals at continued risk of exposure.

**Q: What should I do if I'm bitten by an animal?**
A: Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water, seek immediate medical attention, and begin post-exposure vaccination as soon as possible.

**Q: Can I receive other vaccines at the same time as the rabies vaccine?**
A: It's generally recommended to avoid administering other vaccines concurrently unless advised by a healthcare professional.  Do not mix PVRV with other vaccines or injections.

**Q: How is the rabies vaccine stored?**
A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by the manufacturer.  Generally, refrigeration is necessary.

**Q: Is the rabies vaccine safe?**
A: Rabies vaccine is generally safe and effective, but like any medication, side effects are possible.  Consult your healthcare provider if you have concerns.
