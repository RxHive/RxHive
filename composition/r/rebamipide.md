**How it Works:**

Rebamipide's precise mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to exert its therapeutic effects through multiple pathways:

* **Anti-inflammatory effects:** Rebamipide possesses anti-inflammatory properties, reducing inflammation in the gastric mucosa.

* **Free radical scavenging:** It possesses antioxidant properties, neutralizing free radicals that contribute to gastric mucosal damage.
