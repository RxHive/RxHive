# Ranitidine

**Generic Name:** Ranitidine

**Usage:** Ranitidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist used to treat:

* **Duodenal ulcers:**  It reduces acid production in the stomach, allowing ulcers to heal.
* **Gastric ulcers:** Similar to duodenal ulcers, it helps heal ulcers by decreasing stomach acid.
* **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD):** It relieves heartburn and other GERD symptoms by reducing stomach acid.
* **Zollinger-Ellison syndrome:** A rare condition causing excessive stomach acid production.
* **Preventing stress ulcers:** In hospitalized patients at risk of developing ulcers.


**Side Effects:**  Ranitidine is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur. These are usually mild and may include:

* **Headache:** A common side effect.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or faint.
* **Constipation or diarrhea:** Changes in bowel habits.
* **Abdominal pain:**  Stomach discomfort.
* **Nausea or vomiting:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation.
* **Rare but serious side effects:**  These include liver problems, pancreatitis, and blood disorders.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or unusual symptoms.


**How it Works:** Ranitidine works by blocking histamine from binding to H2 receptors in the stomach. Histamine normally stimulates the production of stomach acid. By blocking these receptors, ranitidine significantly reduces the amount of acid produced, thus relieving symptoms and promoting healing of ulcers and other conditions.
