# Racecadotril + Saccharomyces boulardii + Zinc
### Generic Name
Racecadotril + *Saccharomyces boulardii* + Zinc


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat acute diarrhea, particularly infectious diarrhea in adults and children.  Racecadotril is an antidiarrheal drug that works by inhibiting the enzyme neutral endopeptidase, thus reducing the release of certain substances that contribute to intestinal hypermotility (increased bowel movements). *Saccharomyces boulardii* is a probiotic yeast that helps restore the balance of gut flora, improving the overall health of the intestinal lining. Zinc plays a crucial role in various bodily functions, including immune response and intestinal cell repair, aiding in faster recovery from diarrhea.  This combination aims to alleviate symptoms, shorten the duration of the diarrhea, and promote quicker recovery.  While primarily for acute diarrhea, it may be considered in cases of traveler's diarrhea under a doctor's guidance.


### Dosage

Dosage will vary based on age, weight, and the severity of diarrhea.  It's crucial to follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  There is no standard, universally accepted dosage for this combined formulation as it's not a pre-made, commercially available combination.  Instead, the components are often prescribed individually or in different combinations.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose of each component based on the patient's specific needs. For example:


* **Racecadotril:**  Dosage will typically be based on body weight and is usually given once or twice daily.  
* **Saccharomyces boulardii:**  Dosage is usually specified in terms of the number of live yeast cells (CFU - colony forming units) per dose, and the frequency is determined by the doctor.
* **Zinc:**  Dosage is usually measured in milligrams and depends on the individual's need and doctor's recommendation.

It's important to note:  *This information is not a prescription. Always follow the doctor's instructions regarding dosage and administration.*  Oral administration is the most common route for all three components.  


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation (less common with Racecadotril), abdominal discomfort.  These are usually mild and temporary.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), severe constipation, intestinal obstruction. *Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these.*
* **Side Effects Related to Specific Components:**  *Saccharomyces boulardii* is generally safe, but some individuals may experience mild bloating or gas.  Zinc, in high doses, can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.


### How it Works

Racecadotril reduces intestinal motility (the contractions that move food through the gut) by inhibiting the enzyme neutral endopeptidase. This helps to slow down the passage of stool, easing diarrhea. *Saccharomyces boulardii* works as a probiotic, helping to restore the balance of gut bacteria, reducing inflammation, and supporting gut barrier function. Zinc is vital for immune function and gut cell repair.  The combination of these three components tackles diarrhea from several anglesâ€”decreasing bowel movements, restoring healthy gut flora, and supporting tissue repair.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Racecadotril may interact with other medications; inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.  *Saccharomyces boulardii* may interact with certain medications such as immunosuppressants.
