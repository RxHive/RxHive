# Rabies Human Monoclonal Antibody rDNA
### Generic Name
Rabies Human Monoclonal Antibody (rDNA)

**Note:**  There isn't a single, universally used generic name for rabies human monoclonal antibody products derived from rDNA technology.  Different manufacturers may use slightly different names.  This information addresses the general class of medications.  Always refer to the specific product information provided by your doctor or pharmacist.


### Usage

Rabies human monoclonal antibody (rDNA) is a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment for rabies virus infection.  This means it's used *after* a person has potentially been exposed to the rabies virus, typically through a bite or scratch from an infected animal. It's not a preventative vaccine; instead, it works in conjunction with the rabies vaccine to provide a strong immune response and reduce the risk of developing rabies.  Its primary use is to provide passive immunization, meaning it immediately delivers antibodies to fight the virus, while the rabies vaccine provides active, longer-lasting immunity.  It may be used in situations where the onset of symptoms is imminent or when there is a concern about the effectiveness of the vaccine alone due to factors like a severe exposure.


### Dosage

Dosage and administration of rabies human monoclonal antibodies vary significantly depending on the specific product, the severity of the exposure, the patient's weight and age, and the judgment of the treating physician.  There is no standardized dosage across all products.  **It is crucial to follow the directions provided by the healthcare professional and the specific product labeling.**  This medication is typically administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM) by a healthcare professional. Oral administration is not applicable.  Children and adults will likely receive different doses, determined by weight or body surface area.  The precise dosage regimen, including the number of doses and the interval between doses, will be determined based on individual patient needs and risk assessment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness)
* Headache
* Nausea
* Fever
* Fatigue

Less common but serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to anaphylaxis)
* Serum sickness (a delayed allergic reaction)

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Rabies human monoclonal antibody (rDNA) works by providing a concentrated dose of antibodies specifically targeted against the rabies virus.  These antibodies are produced in a laboratory using recombinant DNA technology, meaning they are manufactured in a way that ensures high purity and consistency.  When administered, these antibodies bind to the rabies virus, neutralizing it and preventing it from infecting and damaging cells. This immediate action helps to buy time for the body's immune system, boosted by the rabies vaccine, to mount a complete and effective immune response.


### Precautions

* **Allergic reactions:**  Individuals with a history of allergic reactions to monoclonal antibodies or other similar medications should be closely monitored.
* **Drug interactions:** While not extensively studied, potential interactions with other medications may exist.  It's important to inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** The safety of rabies human monoclonal antibodies during pregnancy and breastfeeding isn't fully established.  The potential benefits must be carefully weighed against the potential risks in these situations. A healthcare provider should be consulted before use.
* **Renal or hepatic impairment:**  Patients with kidney or liver disease may require dosage adjustments.
* **Pre-existing conditions:**  Individuals with underlying health conditions should discuss their suitability for this treatment with their doctor.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication at home?** A: No, this medication is administered intravenously or intramuscularly by a healthcare professional.
* **Q: How long does the treatment last?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the severity of the exposure and the physician's assessment.
* **Q:  Is it a cure for rabies?** A: No, it's a post-exposure prophylaxis treatment that significantly reduces the risk of developing rabies when given promptly and in conjunction with the rabies vaccine.  It does not cure an established rabies infection.
* **Q: What should I do if I have a reaction?** A: Immediately contact your doctor or seek medical attention if you experience any side effects, especially serious ones like allergic reactions or serum sickness.
* **Q: How is the medication stored?** A:  Storage instructions will be provided by the manufacturer on the medication packaging and should be strictly followed.  Typically, refrigerated storage is required.
