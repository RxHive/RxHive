# Remogliflozin Etabonate + Vildagliptin + Metformin
### Generic Name
Remogliflozin Etabonate + Vildagliptin + Metformin

### Usage

This combination medication is used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults whose blood sugar levels are not adequately controlled with metformin and another drug, such as a DPP-4 inhibitor or SGLT2 inhibitor, alone.  It works by combining three different mechanisms to lower blood sugar:

* **Remogliflozin Etabonate:** This is an SGLT2 (sodium-glucose co-transporter 2) inhibitor.  It works by preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing glucose back into the bloodstream, resulting in increased glucose excretion in the urine. This helps to lower blood sugar levels.

* **Vildagliptin:** This is a DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) inhibitor. It works by increasing the levels of incretins, hormones that stimulate the pancreas to release insulin when blood sugar levels are high and decrease the amount of glucagon (a hormone that raises blood sugar) produced by the liver.

* **Metformin:** This is a biguanide.  It works by decreasing the amount of glucose produced by the liver, and improving the body's sensitivity to insulin.

The combination therapy offers a synergistic effect, meaning the combined action of the three drugs is greater than the sum of their individual effects, leading to better blood sugar control.


### Dosage

Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and response to treatment.  There is no standard dosage for this triple combination as it's not a single FDA-approved product. The components (Remogliflozin, Vildagliptin, and Metformin) are combined based on individual prescriptions, adjusting the dose of each component according to the patient's response. A physician will determine the appropriate dose of each individual medication, considering factors such as the patientâ€™s age, weight, kidney function, and overall health.


Dosage forms for each component will vary. Metformin is commonly available as tablets, extended-release tablets, and oral solutions. Vildagliptin is typically available as tablets.  Remogliflozin etabonate is usually available in tablet form.  There is no injectable form of this combination therapy.

**Important Note:**  Never adjust the dosage of any medication without consulting your doctor or pharmacist.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of this triple combination therapy can include those associated with each individual drug. These may include but aren't limited to:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain
* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** Dizziness, sweating, shakiness, confusion, weakness, rapid heartbeat
* **Urinary tract infections:** Increased urination, frequency, urgency, pain or burning during urination.
* **Dehydration:** Due to increased urination caused by Remogliflozin
* **Ketoacidosis:** A serious complication of diabetes (more likely with SGLT2 inhibitors)
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Fatigue**
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (Seek immediate medical attention if these occur)


Serious, but less common side effects may also occur and require immediate medical attention.  Your healthcare provider can provide a comprehensive list of potential side effects specific to your situation and combination of drugs.


### How it Works

As detailed in the Usage section, this medication combines three different mechanisms of action to improve blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes.  It lowers blood glucose through the combined action of:

* **Reduced glucose reabsorption by the kidneys (Remogliflozin Etabonate)**
* **Enhanced insulin release and reduced glucagon production (Vildagliptin)**
* **Decreased liver glucose production and improved insulin sensitivity (Metformin)**


### Precautions

* **Kidney Disease:** This combination should be used with caution in individuals with kidney disease, as both metformin and Remogliflozin are excreted primarily by the kidneys.  Dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Liver Disease:** Metformin should be avoided in patients with significant liver disease.
* **Heart Failure:**  SGLT2 inhibitors (like Remogliflozin) can increase the risk of heart failure in some individuals.
* **Hypoglycemia:**  The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when using this combination, particularly if other medications that lower blood sugar are also taken.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention if allergic reactions occur.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a healthcare professional.  The safety and efficacy in these populations are not fully established.
* **Drug Interactions:** This combination can interact with other medications.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Alcohol Consumption:** Excessive alcohol intake should be avoided while taking metformin.
