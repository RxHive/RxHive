# Rifampicin + Isoniazid + Ethambutol

**Generic Name:** Rifampicin + Isoniazid + Ethambutol (often abbreviated as RIE)  Note: This combination is not always available as a single fixed-dose combination tablet in all countries.  It's frequently prescribed as three separate medications.

**Usage:**

RIE is a first-line treatment for tuberculosis (TB).  It's typically used in combination with other anti-TB drugs for a duration determined by individual circumstances and the type of TB (e.g., drug-sensitive, drug-resistant).  The specific duration and combination will be determined by a physician.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the specific drug dosages.  Common side effects include:

* **Rifampicin:**  Orange-red discoloration of urine, sweat, and tears; nausea; vomiting; abdominal pain; dizziness; fatigue;  rash;  liver problems (jaundice, elevated liver enzymes); flu-like symptoms.  In rare cases, more serious liver damage can occur.
* **Isoniazid:** Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling in extremities); liver damage; allergic reactions (rash, fever); nausea; vomiting.
* **Ethambutol:**  Visual disturbances (blurred vision, loss of visual acuity, color blindness);  rash; nausea; vomiting; gout.


**How it Works:**

Each drug in the combination targets different aspects of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (the bacteria that causes TB):

* **Rifampicin:** Inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis, preventing the bacteria from replicating.
* **Isoniazid:** Interferes with the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the bacterial cell wall.
* **Ethambutol:** Inhibits arabinosyl transferases, enzymes essential for the synthesis of arabinogalactan, a major component of the mycobacterial cell wall.


By combining these three drugs, the treatment offers a broader and more potent effect against the TB bacteria, reducing the risk of drug resistance and ensuring more effective treatment.
