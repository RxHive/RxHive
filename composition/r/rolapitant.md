# Rolapitant
### Generic Name
Rolapitant

### Usage
Rolapitant is primarily used to prevent delayed nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy.  This is particularly important for patients undergoing highly emetogenic chemotherapy (like cisplatin-based regimens), where the risk of delayed nausea and vomiting is significantly higher. It's typically used in combination with other antiemetic medications for optimal effectiveness. While its primary use is in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, it is not used to treat the nausea and vomiting itself, only to prevent it.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Rolapitant's dosage depends on the type of chemotherapy being administered and the route of administration (intravenous or oral).  It's crucial to follow the precise instructions provided by the prescribing healthcare professional.  A common regimen for highly emetogenic chemotherapy involves a single dose of either 166.5 mg intravenously or 180 mg orally given within 2 hours before chemotherapy starts on day 1. This is usually combined with other antiemetic drugs such as dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (like ondansetron). For moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, lower doses are typically used.  Rolapitant should not be administered more frequently than every 2 weeks.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of rolapitant in children under 2 years old have not been established; therefore, its use is contraindicated in this age group.  Further research is needed to determine appropriate dosages for older children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B), no dosage adjustment is generally necessary. However, for those with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), rolapitant should be avoided if possible. If unavoidable, close monitoring for adverse reactions is essential.  Dosage adjustments for renal impairment are not specifically outlined in current guidelines; however, consultation with a healthcare professional is necessary for patients with severely impaired renal function.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Decreased appetite
* Hiccups
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Abdominal pain
* Urinary tract infection
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Infusion-related reactions (if given intravenously)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Anaphylactic shock
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly severe or concerning ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Rolapitant works by blocking the neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor. This receptor is involved in transmitting signals that trigger nausea and vomiting, specifically the delayed type that occurs after chemotherapy. By blocking this receptor, rolapitant effectively prevents these signals from reaching the vomiting center in the brain.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Rolapitant is contraindicated in patients concurrently using certain CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, such as thioridazine or pimozide, as it can significantly increase their blood levels, potentially leading to serious side effects. It's also contraindicated in children under 2 years old.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, with rolapitant. Patients with known allergies, especially to legumes or related substances, should be closely monitored during administration.  Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.

**Interactions:** Rolapitant is a moderate inhibitor of the CYP2D6 enzyme, which can affect the metabolism of other medications.  This is especially important with thioridazine, as co-administration can lead to a dangerous increase in thioridazine blood levels and potentially cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes (a serious heart rhythm disturbance). Concomitant use should be avoided.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of rolapitant during pregnancy has not been established.  Use is generally not recommended unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. It's unknown whether rolapitant is excreted in breast milk; therefore, careful consideration should be given to the risks and benefits before breastfeeding while using this medication.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take rolapitant with other medications?** A:  It's essential to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, before starting rolapitant.  Certain interactions can occur, particularly with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6.

**Q: How should I store rolapitant?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by the pharmacist. Generally, medications should be stored at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Because rolapitant is typically administered only once before chemotherapy, a missed dose should be reported to your healthcare provider, who will determine the appropriate action.

**Q: How long does it take for rolapitant to work?** A: Rolapitant is intended to prevent delayed nausea and vomiting, meaning its effects are seen over several days after chemotherapy administration, not immediately.

**Q:  Is rolapitant addictive?** A:  Rolapitant is not a controlled substance and does not have a known addictive potential.
