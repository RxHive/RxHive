# Rosuvastatin + Ezetimibe

**Generic Name:** Rosuvastatin/Ezetimibe

**Usage:**

Rosuvastatin/Ezetimibe is used to lower levels of LDL ("bad") cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood, and to raise levels of HDL ("good") cholesterol.  It's prescribed for adults with high cholesterol, particularly those who haven't achieved their cholesterol goals with statin therapy alone.  This combination therapy is often used for patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, including those with a history of heart attack or stroke.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and response.

**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, Rosuvastatin/Ezetimibe can cause side effects, though not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects can include:

* **Muscle aches and pains (myalgia):** This is a relatively common side effect of statins, ranging from mild discomfort to severe muscle pain (myopathy) in rare cases.  Rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle breakdown) is a rare but serious complication.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Diarrhea:**
* **Constipation:**
* **Abdominal pain:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling):**
* **Increased liver enzymes:** Liver function tests are often monitored during treatment.
* **Increased risk of diabetes:** Some studies have shown a slight increased risk of developing diabetes with statin use.


**Serious side effects, though rare, include:**

* **Rhabdomyolysis:**  This requires immediate medical attention.  Symptoms include severe muscle pain, weakness, dark urine.
* **Liver damage:**  Liver function tests are usually monitored.
* **Pancreatitis:** Inflammation of the pancreas.


**How it Works:**

Rosuvastatin is a statin that works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol production in the liver. This leads to a reduction in the production of LDL cholesterol. Ezetimibe works by blocking the absorption of cholesterol from the intestines into the bloodstream.  By combining these two mechanisms, Rosuvastatin/Ezetimibe provides a more significant reduction in LDL cholesterol levels than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take Rosuvastatin/Ezetimibe with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  It usually takes several weeks to see a significant reduction in cholesterol levels. Regular blood tests will monitor your progress.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double up on doses.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Rosuvastatin/Ezetimibe?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of liver damage, so it's best to discuss alcohol intake with your doctor.
* **Q: What are the signs of serious side effects?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe muscle pain, weakness, dark urine, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice), or severe abdominal pain.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Rosuvastatin/Ezetimibe on my own?** A: No.  Always consult your doctor before stopping or changing your medication.  Abruptly stopping treatment can be harmful.
