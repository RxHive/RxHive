# Rabies Immunoglobulin (Equine) (ERIg)
### Generic Name
Rabies Immunoglobulin (Equine) (ERIg)

### Usage
Rabies Immunoglobulin (Equine) (ERIg) is a crucial medication used in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) against rabies.  It's administered to individuals who have potentially been exposed to the rabies virus through a bite or scratch from a rabid or suspected rabid animal.  ERIg provides immediate, passive immunity, meaning it delivers pre-formed antibodies to fight the virus. This is vital because rabies is almost always fatal without prompt treatment.  While the primary use is preventing rabies infection after exposure, it plays no role in treating established rabies infection.

### Dosage
Dosage is determined by body weight, not age.  The recommended dose is 40 IU (International Units) per kilogram (kg) of body weight. The maximum recommended dose is 3000 IU. ERIg is administered intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SubQ). Ideally, as much of the dose as possible should be infiltrated around the wound site, with the remainder given IM, typically in the gluteal region (buttocks).  Administration should be concurrent with the first dose of rabies vaccine, but at separate injection sites.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

*   Local reactions at the injection site (pain, swelling, redness).
*   Fever.
*   Itching.
*   Rash.


Less common, but serious, side effects include immediate hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis) such as:

*   Hypotension (low blood pressure).
*   Dyspnea (shortness of breath).
*   Urticaria (hives).

Delayed hypersensitivity reactions (occurring days to weeks later) are also possible, including:

*   Inflammatory reactions.
*   Arthralgia (joint pain).
*   Adenopathy (swollen lymph nodes).

**If any adverse effects occur, immediately seek medical attention.**

### How it Works
ERIg works by providing passive immunity. It contains high concentrations of antibodies (immunoglobulins) specifically targeted against the rabies virus.  These antibodies are derived from horses that have been immunized against rabies. Upon administration, the antibodies immediately begin neutralizing the rabies virus at the site of the bite or scratch, thereby preventing the virus from spreading to the nervous system and causing infection. This provides crucial time while the active immunization (rabies vaccine) begins to take effect.

### Precautions
*   **Hypersensitivity:** ERIg is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to equine proteins or any component of the product.  A skin test for hypersensitivity is recommended before administration.
*   **Allergic Reactions:** Individuals with a history of allergies, particularly to horse serum, are at increased risk of allergic reactions and should be carefully monitored.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of ERIg during pregnancy has not been fully established.  However, the benefits of post-exposure prophylaxis often outweigh the unknown risks.  ERIg is excreted in breast milk, so healthcare providers should consider the risks and benefits for both the mother and the infant when making decisions about breastfeeding during treatment.
*   **Interactions:**  Although rare, ERIg could theoretically interact with other medications. Consult your healthcare provider about any other medications you are taking.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I get rabies from the ERIg itself?** A: No, ERIg is highly purified and does not pose a risk of rabies transmission.
*   **Q: How long does the protection from ERIg last?** A: ERIg provides immediate, but temporary, protection.  Its effectiveness diminishes over time, generally lasting about 7-10 days. This temporary protection buys time for the rabies vaccine to build long-term immunity.
*   **Q: Is ERIg a substitute for the rabies vaccine?** A: No, ERIg is always used in conjunction with the rabies vaccine. ERIg provides immediate protection, while the vaccine stimulates the body's own immune system to build long-lasting immunity.
*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects, especially allergic reactions.  Prompt medical attention is crucial.
*   **Q: How is ERIg stored?** A: ERIg should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically refrigerated.
