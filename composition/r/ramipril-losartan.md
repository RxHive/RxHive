# Ramipril + Losartan

**Generic Name:** Ramipril/Losartan combination (Note:  There isn't a single universally approved generic name for the combination.  Different manufacturers may use slightly different names, but they will all list Ramipril and Losartan as the active ingredients.)

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with high blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy (thickening of the heart muscle).  It may also be used in patients with diabetes and high blood pressure to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events (such as heart attack or stroke).  The specific usage and dosage will be determined by a physician based on individual patient needs and medical history.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but some common ones include:

* **Common (affecting more than 1 in 100 people):** Dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, fatigue, cough (especially with Ramipril), diarrhea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection.
* **Uncommon (affecting 1 to 10 in 1000 people):**  Muscle cramps, weakness,  rash, itching, changes in taste, sleep disturbances,  constipation.
* **Rare (affecting less than 1 in 1000 people):**  Serious side effects such as angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat),  low blood pressure (hypotension), kidney problems,  changes in blood counts, liver problems,  hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood).  These require immediate medical attention.

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary.  Always consult a doctor if you experience any concerning side effects.

**How it Works:**

This medication combines two different types of blood pressure-lowering drugs:

* **Ramipril:** An ACE inhibitor.  It works by blocking the production of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, ramipril helps relax and widen blood vessels, reducing blood pressure.
* **Losartan:** An angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It works by blocking the action of angiotensin II on blood vessels. This also helps relax and widen blood vessels, lowering blood pressure.


The combination of Ramipril and Losartan provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects of each drug. This allows for better blood pressure control in some patients.
