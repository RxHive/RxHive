# Recombinant Human parathyroid hormone

**Generic Name:** Teriparatide

**Usage:**

Teriparatide is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at increased risk of fracture.  Specifically, it's indicated for those who have already had a fragility fracture or who have other risk factors that make them likely to fracture. It's also used to treat osteoporosis in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.  It's prescribed for those patients who have a high risk of fracture and who have failed or are intolerant to other treatments.  Treatment is typically for a limited duration (up to 24 months) to reduce the risk of bone fracture.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Nausea:** This is relatively common, often mild, and can usually be managed.
* **Headache:**  Another frequently reported side effect.
* **Dizziness:** Can occur, but usually resolves.
* **Leg cramps:** Muscle spasms in the legs.
* **Pain at the injection site:** This is a localized effect at the point of injection.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium):** This is a serious side effect that needs monitoring. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, constipation, weakness, fatigue, confusion, and kidney stones.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  A significant drop in blood pressure.
* **Syncope (fainting):** Loss of consciousness.
* **Osteosarcoma (bone cancer):**  A very rare but serious risk, particularly with prolonged use.  This risk is much higher in certain high-risk groups and should be carefully considered when prescribing.


**How it Works:**

Teriparatide is a recombinant form of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is a naturally occurring hormone that regulates calcium levels in the blood and plays a crucial role in bone formation.  Teriparatide acts by stimulating bone formation, increasing bone mineral density, and reducing the risk of fractures. It works primarily by increasing the activity of osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) while also decreasing the activity of osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells), resulting in a net increase in bone mass.  The daily intermittent administration is crucial to this effect; continuous administration has the opposite effect.


**FAQs:**

* **How is teriparatide administered?**  It's administered via a daily subcutaneous injection (under the skin) using a pre-filled pen.
* **How long does treatment last?**  Treatment is typically for 24 months, though sometimes it may be shorter or longer depending on individual needs and response to therapy.
* **What are the monitoring requirements?**  Regular monitoring of blood calcium levels is necessary to detect and manage hypercalcemia.  Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements are also typically performed to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.
* **Can I take other medications with teriparatide?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions may occur.
* **What are the long-term risks?**  The long-term risks primarily involve the potential for hypercalcemia and the rare but serious risk of osteosarcoma, particularly with prolonged use.
* **What happens after stopping teriparatide?**  Bone loss can occur after stopping teriparatide, so it's important to discuss appropriate follow-up care with your doctor. A different osteoporosis medication will likely be considered after completing treatment with teriparatide.
