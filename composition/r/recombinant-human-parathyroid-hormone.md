# Recombinant Human parathyroid hormone
### Generic Name
Recombinant Human Parathyroid Hormone (rhPTH)  (Note:  This is often sold under brand names like Forteo or Natpara.  This information focuses on the generic.)

### Usage
Recombinant Human Parathyroid Hormone (rhPTH) is primarily used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture, particularly those who have already experienced a fracture.  It's particularly effective for those who haven't responded well to other osteoporosis treatments.  The medication works by stimulating new bone formation.  

While its primary use is in osteoporosis, rhPTH is also sometimes used off-label (meaning it's not officially approved for this use by regulatory bodies) to treat hypoparathyroidism, a condition where the parathyroid glands don't produce enough parathyroid hormone.  However, this off-label use should only be considered under the strict supervision of a physician due to potential risks and the availability of other treatments for hypoparathyroidism.


### Dosage

Dosage of rhPTH varies significantly depending on the specific formulation (e.g., Forteo, Natpara), the individual's condition, and the physician's assessment.  Therefore, the information provided below is generalized and should *not* be interpreted as a prescription.  **Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.**

* **Forteo (teriparatide):** This is a common rhPTH formulation administered via daily subcutaneous injection (under the skin).  The typical dose is 20 mcg once daily.  The duration of treatment is usually limited to 24 months due to potential long-term risks.

* **Natpara (parathyroid hormone):** This is another rhPTH formulation available as an injection. Dosage is determined individually by the physician and adjusted based on blood calcium levels.


**There is no oral form of rhPTH.**  Intravenous (IV) administration is not typically used for rhPTH.  Dosage for children is not established and is generally not used in pediatric populations.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Nausea, dizziness, headache, leg cramps, pain at the injection site.

* **Less Common but Serious:** Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels), which can cause symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and kidney stones.  Rarely, bone tumors (osteosarcoma) have been reported, though the risk is generally low.

**Important Note:**  If you experience any of these side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

rhPTH is a synthetic version of the naturally occurring parathyroid hormone.  Parathyroid hormone plays a critical role in regulating calcium levels and bone metabolism.  rhPTH works by binding to receptors on bone cells, stimulating bone formation (bone building) and increasing calcium absorption from the gut.  This leads to increased bone mineral density, reducing the risk of fractures in individuals with osteoporosis.


### Precautions

* **Hypercalcemia:**  Patients with high blood calcium levels or a history of kidney stones should use caution as rhPTH can further elevate calcium levels.  Regular monitoring of blood calcium levels is crucial.

* **Bone Tumors:**  There is a slightly increased risk of osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, associated with long-term use of rhPTH. Treatment duration is typically limited to 24 months to mitigate this risk.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of rhPTH during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  It should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Discuss this carefully with your doctor.

* **Other Medications:** rhPTH may interact with other medications.  Inform your physician about all medications and supplements you are taking.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of rhPTH, requiring careful monitoring.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from rhPTH treatment?** A:  Improvements in bone mineral density may start to be seen within a few months, but the full effect may take longer.

* **Q: Can I stop taking rhPTH if I feel better?** A: No.  Do not stop taking rhPTH without consulting your doctor.  Consistent treatment is necessary for optimal results.

* **Q: How should I store rhPTH?** A:  Refer to the specific instructions provided with your medication. Generally, it should be refrigerated.

* **Q: Is rhPTH right for me?** A:  Only a doctor can determine if rhPTH is an appropriate treatment for your specific situation.  They will consider your medical history, bone density, and other factors.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of rhPTH?** A:  Long-term studies have shown increased risk of hypercalcemia and bone tumors with prolonged use, hence the typical 24-month treatment limit.
