# Raltegravir
### Generic Name
Raltegravir

### Usage
Raltegravir is an antiretroviral medication, specifically an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI).  Its primary use is in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.  It's crucial to understand that raltegravir is *always* used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs; it's never a standalone treatment. This combination approach is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or antiretroviral therapy (ART).  Raltegravir is frequently included in first-line treatment regimens for HIV-1 in treatment-naive patients (those who have never received antiretroviral treatment before) and is also used in treatment-experienced patients who need a change in their medication regimen.  Off-label uses include non-occupational and occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP and oPEP) for HIV, meaning its use in these contexts is not officially approved but may be considered by healthcare professionals in specific situations.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **HIV-1 Treatment:** The typical dose is 400 mg twice daily (BID).  For patients already virally suppressed on 400mg BID, a switch to 1200 mg once daily (OD) may be considered, though once-daily dosing isn't recommended during pregnancy.  Dosage adjustments are generally not needed for those with mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment.  However, there isn't established dosing for severe hepatic impairment, and the dosage should be adjusted after dialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on intermittent hemodialysis (IHD).

* **HIV-1 nPEP:** 400 mg BID for 28 days, combined with other antiretrovirals, starting within 72 hours of exposure.

* **HIV-1 oPEP:** 400 mg BID for 4 weeks, with concomitant emtricitabine/tenofovir, starting as soon as possible (within 72 hours) after exposure.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children is complex and depends on weight and age, using different formulations (oral suspension or chewable tablets). Weight-based dosing recommendations are available from 3 kg to greater than 40 kg.  Always consult prescribing information for precise weight-based doses for children.  For nPEP in children, the dosage and regimen are similar to adults but adjusted by weight and age, and treatment should begin within 72 hours of exposure.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Headache, insomnia, abnormal dreams, nightmares, dizziness, fatigue, depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal tendencies, psychomotor agitation, abnormal behavior
* Allergic rash
* Increased serum glucose levels
* Increased serum lipase and amylase levels (pancreatic enzymes), nausea, decreased appetite, diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastritis, vomiting

* Increased serum AST levels (liver enzyme), hyperbilirubinemia (high bilirubin), increased serum ALP levels (liver enzyme), hepatitis
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Herpes zoster (shingles)
* Increased creatine phosphokinase levels, weakness
* Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), renal failure, increased serum creatinine levels

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (less than 1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Malignant neoplasms (cancers)
* Myopathy (muscle disease), rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle breakdown)
* Anxiety, cerebellar ataxia, DRESS syndrome (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), hepatic failure (liver failure), immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), paranoia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis


If any side effects occur, especially those listed as serious, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Raltegravir works by blocking the activity of HIV-1 integrase, an enzyme crucial for the virus's replication cycle.  HIV uses integrase to insert its genetic material (viral DNA) into the human cell's DNA. By inhibiting integrase, raltegravir prevents the virus from integrating its DNA into the host cell's genome, thus halting viral replication and preventing further infection of cells.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Raltegravir is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to raltegravir or any component of its formulation.
* **Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS):**  Patients may experience IRIS, an inflammatory response occurring when the immune system recovers during treatment.
* **Rhabdomyolysis and Myopathy:**  There's an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis and myopathy, particularly in patients with pre-existing muscle conditions or those taking other medications that might increase this risk.
* **Skin Reactions:** Serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported.  Any rash should be promptly evaluated.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Raltegravir can interact with other medications.  It's vital to inform healthcare providers of all medications being taken, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Raltegravir is categorized as pregnancy category C. While it's generally recommended to use ART during pregnancy to protect both mother and child, the potential risks and benefits should be carefully weighed.  Raltegravir is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding decisions require careful consideration and consultation with a healthcare professional.
* **Phenylketonuria:** Caution is advised in patients with phenylketonuria due to the presence of phenylalanine in the chewable tablets.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take raltegravir with food?** A: Raltegravir can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store raltegravir?** A: Store raltegravir at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is raltegravir a cure for HIV?** A: No, raltegravir is not a cure for HIV.  It's part of a treatment regimen to manage the virus and improve quality of life.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking raltegravir if I feel better?** A: No.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to drug resistance and a worsening of the infection.  Continue taking the medication as prescribed by your healthcare provider.
