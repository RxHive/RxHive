# Raltegravir

**Generic Name:** Raltegravir

**Usage:** Raltegravir is an antiretroviral medication used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and children.  It's always used in combination with other antiretroviral medications, never as a monotherapy.  Specific usage may vary depending on the patient's individual circumstances and other medications they are taking.  Common uses include:

* As part of a first-line regimen for treating HIV-1 infection in adults and children.
* As part of a regimen for treating HIV-1 infection in adults and children who have experienced virological failure with previous antiretroviral therapy.

**Side Effects:** Like all medications, raltegravir can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency. Some common side effects include:

* **Headache:** A frequent side effect.
* **Nausea:** Can occur, sometimes accompanied by vomiting.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or lacking energy.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation or eruption.
* **Increased liver enzymes:**  This is usually monitored through blood tests.
* **Muscle pain (myalgia):**  Pain in the muscles.
* **Depression:** Changes in mood.


**Severe side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention.  These can include:**

* **Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis):** Symptoms can range from hives and swelling to difficulty breathing.
* **Liver problems (hepatitis):** Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, or abdominal pain.
* **Pancreatitis:** Inflammation of the pancreas, leading to severe abdominal pain.
* **Lactic acidosis:** A rare but serious condition involving a buildup of lactic acid in the blood.


**How it Works:** Raltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI).  It works by blocking the activity of HIV integrase, an enzyme crucial for the virus's replication.  Specifically, it prevents the integration of the HIV viral DNA into the host cell's DNA.  Without integration, the virus cannot replicate and spread.
