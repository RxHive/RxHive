# Rilonacept
### Generic Name
Rilonacept

### Usage
Rilonacept is a medication used to treat several inflammatory conditions. Its primary use is in managing Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), including familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), in adults and children aged 12 and older.  It's also indicated for maintaining remission in adults and children weighing at least 10 kg with deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA). Additionally, rilonacept is used to treat recurrent pericarditis and reduce the risk of recurrence in adults and children aged 12 and older.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **CAPS (FCAS, MWS), Recurrent Pericarditis:** A loading dose of 320 mg (given as two 160 mg injections at separate sites on the same day) is followed by a weekly maintenance dose of 160 mg.  If a dose is missed, it should be administered within 7 days; otherwise, a new schedule should be started.

* **DIRA:** 320 mg once weekly, administered as two 160 mg injections at separate sites on the same day.  If switching from another IL-1 blocker, discontinue the previous medication and begin rilonacept at the time of the next scheduled dose.

**Children (≥12 years):**

* **CAPS (FCAS, MWS), Recurrent Pericarditis:**  Loading dose: 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 320 mg), administered as one or two injections (not exceeding 2 mL per injection).  Maintenance dose: 2.2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 160 mg) once weekly.  Missed doses follow the same guidelines as adult dosing.  For adolescents aged 18 and older, adult dosing applies.

* **DIRA (≥10kg):** 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 320 mg) once weekly. Administered as one or two injections with a maximum of 2 mL per injection.  If two injections are needed, administer them at separate sites on the same day.  Missed doses follow the same guidelines as adult dosing.  Note that safety and efficacy have not been established for children under 12 years or weighing less than 10 kg.

**Administration:** Rilonacept is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  Injection sites should be rotated (abdomen, thigh, or upper arm) and should be free from bruising, redness, tenderness, or hardness.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling, bruising)
* Antibody development
* Infections


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Bacterial meningitis (in rare cases)

**Note:**  This list is not exhaustive. If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Rilonacept is a cytokine trap.  It works by binding to interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), two inflammatory cytokines. By binding to these molecules, rilonacept prevents them from interacting with their receptors on cells, thus blocking the inflammatory response responsible for the symptoms of the conditions it treats. It also binds to interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra).

### Precautions

* **Infections:** Rilonacept increases the risk of infections. Patients with a history of infections or those with conditions that predispose them to infections should be carefully monitored.
* **Immunizations:** Patients should be up-to-date on their immunizations before starting treatment. Live vaccines should be avoided during treatment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concurrent use with other IL-1 blockers (like anakinra) or TNF-blocking agents is generally not recommended due to an increased risk of serious infections.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Rilonacept is a Category C drug in pregnancy.  The potential risks to the fetus should be weighed against the benefits of treatment.  It is unknown whether rilonacept is excreted in breast milk.
* **Lipid Profile:**  Rilonacept can cause changes in lipid levels; regular monitoring of lipid profiles is recommended.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see improvements varies depending on the individual and the condition being treated.  It may take several weeks to months to experience a full response.

* **Q: How is Rilonacept stored?** A:  Store rilonacept in the refrigerator. Do not freeze.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Rilonacept abruptly?** A:  No, you should not stop taking Rilonacept without consulting your healthcare provider.  Discontinuation should be done gradually as directed by your physician.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Administer the missed dose as soon as possible, within 7 days. If more than 7 days have passed, contact your doctor to establish a new schedule.
