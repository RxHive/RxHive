# Rucaparib
### Generic Name
Rucaparib

### Usage
Rucaparib is a PARP (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) inhibitor primarily used in treating specific types of cancers.  Its main application is in adult patients with deleterious germline and/or somatic *BRCA* mutation-associated ovarian cancer (including epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancers) who have received at least two prior lines of chemotherapy.  

It also sees use as maintenance therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer (epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal) in adults who have shown a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.  Furthermore, Rucaparib is used to treat adults with deleterious *BRCA* mutation-associated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have undergone androgen receptor-directed therapy and taxane-based chemotherapy.  The presence of a *BRCA* mutation, detectable by an approved test, is crucial for determining suitability for Rucaparib treatment in these cancers.

### Dosage

**Ovarian Cancer (Advanced and Recurrent Maintenance):** The typical adult dosage is 600 mg orally twice daily (BID), continuing until disease progression or intolerable side effects emerge.

**Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer:**  The adult dosage is also 600 mg orally BID until disease progression or intolerable side effects. Patients should concurrently receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog or have undergone bilateral orchiectomy.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Rucaparib in pediatric patients have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are not consistently defined in the manufacturer's labeling for hepatic or renal impairment. However, for mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ULN and serum AST >ULN or total bilirubin 1–1.5 times ULN and any AST level), no adjustment is typically needed. For moderate-to-severe impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 times ULN), adjustment guidance is lacking.  Similarly, for renal impairment, no specific dosage adjustments are provided for creatinine clearance (CrCl) below 30 mL/min or for those undergoing hemodialysis. Dose reduction may be necessary for managing various side effects like anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal issues, as described below.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

*   Nervous system: Depression, dizziness, fatigue, headache, insomnia
*   Cardiovascular: Peripheral edema
*   Gastrointestinal: Abdominal distention, pain, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, nausea, stomatitis, vomiting
*   Dermatologic: Skin rash
*   Endocrine & Metabolic: Increased serum cholesterol
*   Hematologic: Anemia, decreased white blood cell count, lymphocytopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia
*   Hepatic: Increased serum ALT, ALP, and AST levels
*   Neuromuscular & Skeletal: Asthenia
*   Renal: Increased serum creatinine
*   Respiratory: Dyspnea, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection
*   Other: Fever

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (1-10%):**

*   Oncologic: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)

It is vital to contact a healthcare provider immediately if any adverse effects occur.


### How it Works

Rucaparib inhibits PARP enzymes, including PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3, involved in DNA repair.  By blocking PARP, Rucaparib interferes with DNA repair mechanisms, leading to increased DNA damage and ultimately, cell death, particularly in cancer cells with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and other DNA repair genes. This targeted mechanism makes it effective against specific cancers with these genetic mutations.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Interactions:** Coadministration of Rucaparib can increase exposure to certain CYP substrates (CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C9, CYP2C19), potentially increasing toxicity. Dosage adjustments may be necessary. Careful monitoring is recommended, especially when co-administered with warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate).
* **Warnings:**  Increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) and embryo-fetal toxicity.  Pregnant women should avoid Rucaparib. Effective contraception is essential for women of reproductive potential during treatment and for six months afterward.  Men should also use effective contraception if their partner is pregnant or of reproductive potential. Men should not donate sperm during treatment and for three months after the last dose.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. Consultation with a healthcare professional is crucial in such cases.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I eat while taking Rucaparib?** A: Yes, Rucaparib can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: What should I do if I vomit after taking a dose?** A: Do not take another dose to compensate for a vomited dose.
* **Q: Are there any special precautions for storage?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication label.
* **Q:  How long does it take to see results?** A: The time to see a clinical response varies greatly between patients and their specific cancer type.  Your healthcare provider can discuss the anticipated timeline for your situation.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent.
