# Risdiplam
### Generic Name
Risdiplam

### Usage
Risdiplam is primarily used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in patients aged 2 months and older. SMA is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease that causes progressive muscle weakness and wasting, leading to significant disability and, in severe cases, death. Risdiplam works by increasing the production of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is deficient in individuals with SMA.  This increased SMN protein helps improve motor function and potentially slow the progression of the disease.

### Dosage

Risdiplam dosage varies depending on the patient's age and weight. It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage exactly as directed by a healthcare professional.  The medication is administered orally (by mouth).  Here's a summary:

* **Spinal Muscular Atrophy:**

    * **Infants (≥2 months to <2 years):** 0.2 mg/kg/dose once daily (OD).
    * **Children (≥2 years and adolescents):**
        * Weight < 20 kg: 0.25 mg/kg/dose OD
        * Weight ≥ 20 kg: 5 mg OD

    * **Adults:** 5 mg OD

Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not routinely recommended based on current guidelines, but individual cases may require adjustments based on clinical judgment.  Always consult with a doctor or pharmacist before making any changes to the prescribed dosage.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Skin rash (various types)
* Pneumonia
* Upper respiratory tract infections (like the common cold)
* Fever

Less common, but potentially serious side effects can also occur.  These may include, but are not limited to, serious allergic reactions.  

**It's essential to report any new or worsening symptoms to a healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Risdiplam is a survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing modifier.  In individuals with SMA, mutations in the SMN1 gene result in insufficient production of the SMN protein, crucial for the health and function of motor neurons (nerve cells that control muscles).  Risdiplam works by increasing the amount of functional SMN protein produced from the SMN2 gene, a backup gene that usually produces a less functional form of the protein. By enhancing SMN protein production, Risdiplam helps to improve motor neuron function and slow disease progression.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Risdiplam is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to it or any of its components.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Risdiplam may cause fetal harm.  Pregnant women should discuss the risks with their doctor. Effective contraception is recommended during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose.  The effect of Risdiplam on breastfeeding is unknown; the benefits and risks should be carefully weighed.
* **Drug Interactions:** Risdiplam may interact with other medications, particularly those eliminated by MATE1 or MATE2-K transporters (such as metformin).  Consult a healthcare provider about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, before starting Risdiplam.
* **Children and Older Adults:**  Specific dosage adjustments are outlined above based on age and weight. Careful monitoring is necessary in these groups.
* **Administration:**  Risdiplam should be administered orally after a meal, and the oral syringe provided should be used. If vomiting occurs after administration or if the dose is not fully swallowed, do not administer another dose.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Risdiplam with other medications?** A:  You must inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements, as interactions are possible.
* **Q: How should I store Risdiplam?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided with your prescription.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If it's within 6 hours of your usual time, take it as soon as possible.  If more than 6 hours have passed, skip the missed dose and resume your regular schedule the next day. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Are there long-term effects of Risdiplam?** A: Long-term effects are still being studied.  Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is important.
* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any new or worsening symptoms.
