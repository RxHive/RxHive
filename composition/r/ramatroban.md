# Ramatroban
### Generic Name
Ramatroban

### Usage
Ramatroban is primarily used to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  It's a medication that works by targeting specific substances involved in the allergic response. While its primary use is in treating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, it's important to note that it's not currently approved for widespread use in many regions and its application may be limited to specific clinical trials or research settings.  Always consult a healthcare professional for appropriate treatment.

### Dosage
The typical adult dosage for allergic rhinitis is 75 mg given twice daily (BID), typically after meals or before bed. The medication is usually administered orally in tablet form.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Ramatroban is contraindicated (absolutely not to be used) in individuals with liver dysfunction.
* **Renal Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for those with kidney impairment.  A healthcare professional should be consulted for guidance in such cases.
* **Children:**  There is currently no established dosage for children, and use in children is generally not recommended without specific guidance from a physician involved in a relevant clinical trial.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ramatroban is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of Ramatroban may include:

* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Rash
* Itching
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Palpitations
* Gastric discomfort
* Gum and nasal bleeding
* Purpura (purple discolorations on the skin)
* Prolonged menstruation
* Generalized malaise (general feeling of discomfort)
* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, are possible.  If you experience any concerning side effects, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Ramatroban is a thromboxane receptor antagonist.  Thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin D2 are substances that play a significant role in the inflammatory processes underlying allergic rhinitis. Ramatroban works by blocking the action of these substances, thus reducing the symptoms associated with allergic reactions like sneezing, runny nose, and nasal congestion.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Ramatroban is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug.
* **Bleeding Disorders:**  Ramatroban should be used with extreme caution, or avoided entirely, in patients with bleeding tendencies or a history of bleeding disorders.
* **Liver Disease:**  As previously stated, Ramatroban is contraindicated in individuals with liver dysfunction.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ramatroban is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  
* **Menstruation:**  Use during menstruation should be avoided.
* **Drug Interactions:**  The potential for interactions with other medications needs to be carefully considered.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
