# Rivaroxaban

**Generic Name:** Rivaroxaban

**Usage:** Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant (blood thinner) used to prevent and treat blood clots.  Its specific uses include:

* **Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF):**  This is a common use, especially in patients at high risk of stroke.
* **Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE):**  This involves treating existing blood clots in the legs (DVT) or lungs (PE).
* **Prevention of DVT and PE after certain types of surgery:**  Specifically, hip or knee replacement surgery.
* **Reduction of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (heart attack), and stroke in patients with coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease:** In select patients with a history of these conditions.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, rivaroxaban can cause side effects.  These can range from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Bleeding:** This is the most significant risk, ranging from minor bruising to serious internal bleeding.  This risk is increased with age and other medical conditions.
* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain.
* **Rash or itching:** Allergic reactions are possible, though less common.
* **Increased bruising:**  More easily noticeable bruising due to its anticoagulant effect.
* **Headache:**
* **Back pain:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Dizziness:**


**Serious side effects, although less common, require immediate medical attention and include:**

* **Severe bleeding:**  Any unusual bleeding (e.g., black stools, bloody urine, prolonged bleeding from cuts), heavy menstrual bleeding.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.
* **Hepatic (liver) impairment:**  Signs of liver problems like jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes).


**How it Works:** Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor.  Factor Xa is a crucial enzyme in the blood clotting cascade. By inhibiting factor Xa, rivaroxaban prevents the formation of blood clots, thus reducing the risk of thromboembolic events (blood clots blocking blood vessels).
