# Ravulizumab
### Generic Name
Ravulizumab

### Usage

Ravulizumab is a medication used to treat two serious blood disorders: paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).  Both conditions involve problems with the complement system, a part of the body's immune system.  In PNH, this leads to the destruction of red blood cells, causing anemia and fatigue. In aHUS, it causes damage to blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to kidney failure and other complications. Ravulizumab works by inhibiting a specific part of the complement system, preventing the damage to red blood cells and blood vessels.  It is crucial to note that Ravulizumab is *not* indicated for Shiga toxin *Escherichia coli*-related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS).

### Dosage

Ravulizumab is administered intravenously (IV) and the dosage depends on the patient's weight and age.  It's critical to note that vaccination with a meningococcal vaccine at least two weeks before treatment is essential, with revaccination following current guidelines.  If immediate treatment is necessary and vaccination has occurred less than two weeks prior, two weeks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis is advised.

**Adult Dosage (PNH and aHUS):**

* **5 to <10 kg:** Loading dose: 600 mg IV; Maintenance dose: 300 mg IV every 4 weeks, starting 2 weeks after the loading dose.
* **10 to <20 kg:** Loading dose: 600 mg IV; Maintenance dose: 600 mg IV every 4 weeks, starting 2 weeks after the loading dose.
* **≥20 kg to <30 kg:** Loading dose: 900 mg IV; Maintenance dose: 2100 mg IV every 8 weeks, starting 2 weeks after the loading dose.
* **≥30 kg to <40 kg:** Loading dose: 1200 mg IV; Maintenance dose: 2700 mg IV every 8 weeks, starting 2 weeks after the loading dose.
* **≥40 kg to <60 kg:** Loading dose: 2400 mg IV; Maintenance dose: 3000 mg IV every 8 weeks, starting 2 weeks after the loading dose.
* **≥60 kg to <100 kg:** Loading dose: 2700 mg IV; Maintenance dose: 3300 mg IV every 8 weeks, starting 2 weeks after the loading dose.
* **≥100 kg:** Loading dose: 3000 mg IV; Maintenance dose: 3600 mg IV every 8 weeks, starting 2 weeks after the loading dose.


**Pediatric Dosage (PNH and aHUS, ≥1 month old):**  The pediatric dosage mirrors the adult dosage, based on weight.  Refer to the adult dosage section above for specific weight-based guidelines.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are needed for hepatic or renal impairment. However, if an adverse reaction occurs during infusion, the infusion rate should be slowed or stopped as deemed appropriate by a healthcare provider.  When switching from eculizumab to Ravulizumab, the Ravulizumab loading dose is administered two weeks after the last eculizumab dose, with subsequent doses every four or eight weeks (depending on weight) beginning two weeks post-loading dose.


### Side Effects

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Ravulizumab is a targeted therapy that selectively binds to a specific protein in the complement system called C5.  The complement system is a crucial part of the immune response.  However, in PNH and aHUS, uncontrolled activation of the complement system causes damage to blood cells and blood vessels.  By binding to C5, Ravulizumab prevents its cleavage into C5a and C5b, which are responsible for triggering the damaging cascade of events in these conditions. This prevents the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC, or C5b-9), a key player in the damage process, thus protecting red blood cells and blood vessels.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Ravulizumab is contraindicated in patients with an unresolved *Neisseria meningitidis* infection and those not vaccinated against it, unless the benefits of immediate treatment outweigh the risk of meningococcal infection.

* **Warnings:** Ravulizumab significantly increases the risk of serious meningococcal infections. Meningococcal vaccination is crucial before starting treatment.  Patients should be monitored for signs of infection.

* **Interactions:** Ravulizumab can interact with other medications, including vaccines, affecting their effectiveness. Consult a doctor about potential interactions before taking other medications concurrently.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Ravulizumab during pregnancy is unknown. Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for eight months afterward.

* **Vulnerable Populations:**  Special care should be taken when administering Ravulizumab to children and older adults.  Close monitoring is necessary for any adverse effects.
