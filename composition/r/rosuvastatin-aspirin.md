# Rosuvastatin + Aspirin
### Generic Name
Rosuvastatin + Aspirin

**Note:**  Rosuvastatin and aspirin are typically prescribed as separate medications, not a combined fixed-dose formulation.  This information outlines the properties and usage of each drug when used together in a prescribed regimen, not as a single combined pill.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and administration.


### Usage

This combination therapy is primarily used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients at high risk.  This includes individuals with a history of heart attack, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or diabetes, or those with multiple risk factors such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and smoking.

* **Rosuvastatin:** This is a statin medication, which lowers LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels in the blood.  Lowering LDL cholesterol helps to reduce the buildup of plaque in the arteries, thereby reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. It also slightly raises HDL ("good") cholesterol.

* **Aspirin:** This is an antiplatelet agent.  It works by preventing blood platelets from clumping together, reducing the formation of blood clots. Blood clots can block blood flow to the heart or brain, leading to heart attacks or strokes. This effect is crucial in preventing further cardiovascular events.


### Dosage

Dosage for both rosuvastatin and aspirin are determined individually by a healthcare professional based on several factors, including the patient's medical history, other medications, and overall health.  There is no single fixed-dose combination readily available, so dosages are prescribed separately.

* **Rosuvastatin:** Dosage typically ranges from 5mg to 40mg once daily, taken orally with or without food.  The starting dose is usually lower, and may be increased gradually as per the doctor’s instructions.  Dosage adjustments may be needed for patients with kidney or liver problems.

* **Aspirin:**  For cardiovascular risk reduction, the typical dose is 75-162mg daily, taken orally. The exact dosage depends on individual risk factors and the doctor's assessment.  Lower doses are often used for long-term prevention, while higher doses might be prescribed for short-term treatment following a cardiovascular event.  


### Side Effects

**Rosuvastatin:**

* Common: Muscle aches (myalgia), headache, nausea, diarrhea, constipation.
* Less common but serious:  Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown – requires immediate medical attention), liver damage, allergic reactions.


**Aspirin:**

* Common: Stomach upset, heartburn, nausea, bleeding (gums, nose, stools).
* Less common but serious: Severe gastrointestinal bleeding, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), increased risk of bleeding with other medications.


**Important Note:**  If you experience any significant or concerning side effects, discontinue the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

* **Rosuvastatin:** It inhibits an enzyme (HMG-CoA reductase) involved in cholesterol production in the liver. By inhibiting this enzyme, the liver produces less cholesterol, leading to a reduction in LDL cholesterol levels in the blood.

* **Aspirin:** It inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, particularly COX-1, which is involved in platelet aggregation. By inhibiting COX-1, aspirin reduces platelet stickiness, decreasing the likelihood of blood clot formation.


### Precautions

* **Rosuvastatin:** Should be used cautiously in patients with liver or kidney disease, muscle disorders, or hypothyroidism.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with your doctor.  Muscle pain should be reported promptly.

* **Aspirin:** Should be used cautiously in patients with a history of bleeding disorders, peptic ulcers, or asthma.  Increased bleeding risk is possible when combined with other blood thinners (e.g., warfarin, other NSAIDs).  It should be avoided in children and adolescents due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with your doctor.
