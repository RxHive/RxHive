# Raxibacumab
### Generic Name
Raxibacumab

### Usage
Raxibacumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment and prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax caused by *Bacillus anthracis*.  It's crucial to understand that raxibacumab is *not* an antimicrobial agent; it must always be used in combination with appropriate antibacterial medications to effectively combat the infection.  Its primary use is in treating adults and children with inhalational anthrax, acting to neutralize the toxins produced by the bacteria.  It may also be used for prophylaxis (prevention) of inhalational anthrax when other treatment options are unavailable or unsuitable.  Importantly, raxibacumab does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is therefore ineffective against anthrax meningitis.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For both treatment and prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax, the recommended dose is 40 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) as a single infusion over 2 hours and 15 minutes.  Diphenhydramine (25-50 mg, either oral or IV) should be given up to one hour before the raxibacumab infusion to minimize the risk of infusion reactions.

**Children:**  Dosage varies by weight:

*   Weight â‰¤ 10 kg: 80 mg/kg as a single IV dose.
*   Weight >10 kg to 40 kg: 60 mg/kg as a single IV dose.
*   Weight > 40 kg: 40 mg/kg as a single IV dose.

Similar to adults, diphenhydramine should be administered before the infusion to mitigate potential reactions.  Pediatric dosing is extrapolated from adult data, as there have been no dedicated pediatric studies.  The choice to use raxibacumab in children with anthrax should carefully consider the benefit-risk profile in conjunction with the availability of other treatments.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are recommended for hepatic or renal impairment, though adjustment is unlikely to be necessary for renal issues given its non-renal clearance.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

*   Skin rash
*   Pain
*   Itching (pruritus)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  Anemia, back pain, drowsiness, fatigue, flushing, hypertension, increased creatine phosphokinase levels, increased serum amylase levels, insomnia, leukopenia, lymphadenopathy, muscle spasms, pain at the infusion site, palpitations, peripheral edema, prolonged prothrombin time, vasodepressor syncope, and vertigo have been reported.

**Important Note:**  Any adverse effects, especially severe reactions, should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Raxibacumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets and neutralizes the protective antigen (PA) component of the *Bacillus anthracis* toxin.  The anthrax toxin comprises lethal factor and edema factor, both needing PA to enter host cells and cause disease.  By binding to and neutralizing the PA, raxibacumab prevents the toxin from entering cells, thus limiting the damage caused by the anthrax infection.

### Precautions

*   **Hypersensitivity:**  Raxibacacumab can cause serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.  Administration should occur in a monitored setting with appropriate equipment and trained personnel readily available to manage such emergencies. Premedication with diphenhydramine is recommended.
*   **Infusion Reactions:** Infusion-related reactions are possible.  Close monitoring during infusion is necessary, and the infusion rate may need to be adjusted or paused if adverse effects develop.
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Data on the use of raxibacumab in pregnant women is limited.  The decision to use it during pregnancy or lactation should carefully weigh the benefits against potential risks to the mother and child.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
*   **Combination Therapy:** Raxibacumab is *not* a standalone treatment for anthrax.  It must always be used concurrently with appropriate antibacterial therapy.
