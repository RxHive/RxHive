* **Metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST):** After treatment with imatinib and sunitinib.
* **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):** After treatment with sorafenib.
* **Locally advanced or metastatic, unresectable, well-differentiated, or moderately differentiated, non-squamous NSCLC:** After treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and docetaxel


**Side Effects:**

**How it Works:**

Regorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor.  This means it blocks the activity of several different protein kinases involved in tumor growth and the development of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).  Specifically, it inhibits several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, RET, KIT, and BRAF. By inhibiting these kinases, regorafenib disrupts multiple pathways essential for cancer cell survival and growth, leading to tumor shrinkage or slowed progression.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is Regorafenib administered?**  A: Regorafenib is taken orally (by mouth) once daily.
* **Q: How long will I be on Regorafenib?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your response to the medication and the presence of side effects.  Treatment may continue as long as it is beneficial and tolerable.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking Regorafenib?** A: Your doctor may recommend dietary changes depending on your side effects, such as managing diarrhea or nausea.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Regorafenib?** A:  Alcohol should generally be avoided or significantly limited while taking Regorafenib due to potential interactions and exacerbation of side effects, especially liver toxicity. Always consult your doctor.
* **Q: What are the drug interactions?** A: Regorafenib can interact with other medications, including those that affect the liver or increase the risk of bleeding. It is crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, herbal supplements, and over-the-counter drugs you are taking.
* **Q:  Is Regorafenib a cure for cancer?** A: No, Regorafenib is not a cure for cancer. It is a treatment aimed at slowing the progression of the disease and improving quality of life.
