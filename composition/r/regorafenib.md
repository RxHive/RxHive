# Regorafenib
### Generic Name
Regorafenib

### Usage

Regorafenib is a targeted cancer medication, specifically a kinase inhibitor.  Its primary use is in treating metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in patients who have already received several other lines of therapy, including fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, anti-VEGF therapy, and anti-EGFR therapy (if the KRAS gene is wild-type).  

Importantly, Regorafenib is used *after* other treatments have been tried and haven't worked well enough.  It's a later-line treatment option for advanced disease.  

Beyond mCRC, Regorafenib also sees use in treating locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) that haven't responded adequately to imatinib and sunitinib.  It's also approved for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after treatment with sorafenib has failed.  While it's not officially approved for other cancers, it's sometimes used off-label in certain situations, under strict medical supervision.


### Dosage

The standard adult dose of Regorafenib is 160 mg once daily (OD) for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. This cycle repeats until the cancer progresses or intolerable side effects occur. The medication is taken orally.  

Dosage adjustments are frequently necessary based on individual patient tolerance and side effects.  For example, if a patient experiences significant side effects like hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), the dose might be reduced to 120 mg or even 80 mg daily.  Severe side effects may necessitate temporary treatment interruption or permanent discontinuation.  Specific dosage adjustments depend on the type and severity of side effects, liver and kidney function, and other individual factors.  It is crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions closely.

Pediatric use of Regorafenib is not currently recommended as safety and efficacy have not been established in children.


### Side Effects

Regorafenib, like many cancer treatments, can cause various side effects.  The frequency and severity vary from person to person. Some common side effects include:

*   Fatigue
*   High blood pressure (hypertension)
*   Anemia (low red blood cell count)
*   Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT)
*   Diarrhea
*   Mouth sores (mucositis)
*   Hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) â€“ redness, swelling, and pain in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet
*   Bleeding (hemorrhage)

Less common, but more serious side effects can include heart problems, infections, and issues with the nervous system.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported immediately to a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Regorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor.  This means it blocks the activity of several different kinds of proteins called kinases that play a crucial role in the growth and spread of cancer cells. By inhibiting these kinases, including VEGF receptors, Regorafenib disrupts processes essential for tumor growth and the formation of new blood vessels that supply tumors (angiogenesis).  This ultimately helps to slow down or stop the progression of cancer.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Regorafenib is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Regorafenib's metabolism can be affected by other medications.  Specifically, strong inducers or inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme system should be used cautiously or avoided if possible, as they can significantly alter Regorafenib's blood levels.  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your doctor before starting Regorafenib.
*   **Hepatotoxicity:** Regorafenib can cause severe liver damage (hepatotoxicity). Regular liver function tests are essential during treatment to monitor for this risk.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Regorafenib is categorized as pregnancy category D, meaning it poses a risk to the developing fetus.  Effective contraception is crucial for both men and women during treatment and for a period afterward.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment or for two weeks following the final dose.
*   **Other Precautions:**  Patients should be monitored for other serious side effects, such as high blood pressure, bleeding, infections, and heart problems.  The risk of impaired wound healing is also increased.
