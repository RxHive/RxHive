# Rabies  Vaccine(Neural Tissue)
### Generic Name
Rabies Vaccine (Neural Tissue)

### Usage
Rabies vaccine (neural tissue), also known as Semple vaccine, is primarily used for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of rabies.  This means it's administered after a person has been potentially exposed to the rabies virus, such as through a bite or scratch from an infected animal.  Its purpose is to stimulate the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the rabies virus, preventing the development of the disease.  It is crucial to note that this vaccine type is rarely used now due to the availability of safer and more effective cell-culture based vaccines.  Its use is largely restricted to a few regions in Asia and Africa where access to newer vaccines may be limited.

### Dosage
The dosage of rabies vaccine (neural tissue) varies considerably and isn't standardized across all regions where it might still be used.  Generally, the regimen involves a series of multiple intramuscular or subcutaneous injections (typically 14 injections of 2-5 mL each) administered into the anterior abdominal wall. All injections are given consecutively.  Specific dosage and injection schedules should be determined by a healthcare professional experienced in rabies management. There are no specific dosage adjustments provided for hepatic or renal impairment according to the manufacturer's labeling.  Pediatric dosing is not well-defined for this vaccine and should be determined on a case-by-case basis under strict medical supervision.

### Side Effects
* Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Neurological complications (this is a significant risk, and a major reason for the vaccine's decline in use):
    * Meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord)
    * Mono-neuritis multiplex (inflammation of multiple peripheral nerves)
    * Dorsolumbar transverse myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord)
    * Ascending paralysis (paralysis progressing from the lower to upper body)

**Important:** If any adverse effects occur, particularly neurological symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Rabies vaccine (neural tissue) contains inactivated rabies virus grown in sheep brain tissue.  Upon injection, the vaccine introduces the inactivated virus to the body. This triggers an immune response, prompting the body to produce antibodies specifically targeting the rabies virus. These antibodies provide active immunity, protecting against future rabies infection should the person be exposed to the virus.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to neural tissue or any component of the vaccine.
* **Interactions:** Concomitant use with immunosuppressants (like corticosteroids or chemotherapy drugs) may decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine.  Simultaneous administration with rabies immune globulin (RIG) is not recommended due to the potential for neutralization of the vaccine's effects.  These medications should be administered at different sites and times to minimize interaction.
* **Warnings:** There is an increased risk of anaphylactoid reactions, meningoencephalitis, syncope (fainting), and seizures.  Close monitoring is crucial after each injection.  Pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and individuals with underlying neurological conditions should be carefully evaluated before receiving this vaccine. Due to the risk of neurological complications, use of this vaccine should only occur when modern, safer rabies vaccines are not available.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I eat or drink before receiving the vaccine?** A:  The vaccine can be administered without regard to food intake.
* **Q: What should I do after receiving the injection?** A: Remain under observation for at least 15 minutes after each injection to monitor for syncope or other adverse reactions. Avoid strenuous activities and alcohol immediately following vaccination.
* **Q: Is this vaccine safe?** A: While it can provide protection against rabies, it carries a higher risk of serious neurological side effects compared to newer cell-culture vaccines.  This is a critical reason for its declining use.
* **Q: How is the vaccine stored?** A: Storage instructions vary depending on the specific formulation and should be followed precisely as directed on the product label.  Generally, it is stored under refrigeration.
* **Q: Are there any alternatives to this vaccine?** A: Yes, modern cell-culture-based rabies vaccines are safer and significantly reduce the risk of neurological side effects.  These should be used whenever possible.
