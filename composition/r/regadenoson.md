# Regadenoson
### Generic Name
Regadenoson

### Usage
Regadenoson is primarily used as a pharmacologic stress agent in radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI).  MPI is a nuclear imaging test used to evaluate blood flow to the heart muscle. Regadenoson is employed in patients who are unable to undergo adequate exercise stress testing, either due to physical limitations or other medical conditions.  The test helps assess for coronary artery disease (CAD) by showing how well blood flows to the heart muscle during periods of increased demand.  While its primary use is in MPI, it's solely used for diagnostic purposes and doesn't treat the underlying condition (CAD).  Treatment for CAD, if diagnosed, would involve other interventions like medication or procedures.

### Dosage
**Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI):**

* **Adults:** The standard dose is 0.4 mg administered intravenously (IV) as a single injection.  This should be followed immediately by a 5 mL saline flush.  The injection should be given over 10 seconds or less.

* **Children:** The safety and efficacy of regadenoson have not been established in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer based on hepatic function.

* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to severe renal impairment. Regadenoson is dialyzable.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Cardiac conduction disturbances (irregular heartbeats)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Flushing (redness of the skin)
* Ventricular premature contractions (PVCs - extra heartbeats originating from the ventricles)
* Chest discomfort or angina (chest pain)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Feeling hot
* Atrial premature contractions (PACs - extra heartbeats originating from the atria)
* Chest pain
* Systolic hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Ventricular conduction abnormalities
* Systolic hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Decreased diastolic blood pressure
* Nausea
* Abdominal distress
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Wheezing


**Rare but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Acute coronary syndrome
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Asystole (absence of heartbeat)
* Atrioventricular conduction disturbances (various heart block types)
* Bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways)
* Cardiac arrest
* Cerebrovascular accident (stroke)
* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Seizures
* Respiratory arrest
* Syncope (fainting)

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious or unexpected, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Regadenoson is an A2A adenosine receptor agonist.  Adenosine is a naturally occurring substance that causes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). By activating the A2A adenosine receptors in the heart, regadenoson increases coronary blood flow (the flow of blood through the coronary arteries). This increased blood flow mimics the effect of exercise on the heart. During MPI, the increased blood flow is visualized by a radiopharmaceutical, allowing doctors to identify areas of reduced blood flow that may indicate coronary artery disease.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Regadenoson is contraindicated in patients with second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block or sinus node dysfunction unless they have a functioning artificial pacemaker.

* **Increased Risk:**  The use of regadenoson increases the risk of atrial fibrillation/flutter, cerebrovascular events, conduction disturbances, hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), hypertension, hypotension, myocardial ischemia, respiratory effects, and seizures.

* **Caution:** Use with caution in elderly patients and in those with significant cardiac or pulmonary risk factors.

* **Drug Interactions:**  The effects of regadenoson may be diminished by aminophylline, caffeine, theophylline, and dipyridamole.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Regadenoson is a Category C drug in pregnancy.  The manufacturer recommends interrupting breastfeeding for 10 hours after administration due to the unknown risk of excretion in breast milk.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the effect of regadenoson last?** A: The effects are generally short-lived, lasting only a few minutes.

* **Q: What should I avoid before taking regadenoson?** A: Avoid caffeine (including coffee, tea, and chocolate) for at least 12 hours before the procedure.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects to your healthcare provider immediately, especially if they are severe or concerning.

* **Q: Is regadenoson safe for everyone?** A: No, regadenoson is not suitable for everyone.  Your doctor will assess your medical history and current health status to determine if it's appropriate for you.

* **Q: How is regadenoson administered?** A: It's administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional.

* **Q: How is regadenoson stored?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication label.
