# Rifampicin [Rifampin] +Isoniazid +Pyrazinamide
### Generic Name
Rifampicin + Isoniazid + Pyrazinamide

### Usage

This fixed-dose combination (FDC) of Rifampicin, Isoniazid, and Pyrazinamide is primarily used in the initial phase of treating pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).  It's a crucial part of a short-course regimen designed to eradicate the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* bacteria responsible for the disease.  While primarily used for pulmonary TB, the combination may be considered for other forms of TB depending on the severity and specific circumstances, as determined by a physician.  This is a powerful combination, and its use should always be under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Tuberculosis):**  Dosage is determined by weight and administered orally.  The typical regimen is as follows:

* ≤44 kg: 4 tablets once daily (OD)
* 45-54 kg: 5 tablets OD
* ≥55 kg: 6 tablets OD

This daily, continuous dosage should be taken for at least two months (the initial phase). Treatment is typically continued with Rifampicin and Isoniazid for at least another four months,  or longer, depending on factors like sputum culture results, presence of resistant organisms, and HIV status.

**Pediatric Dosage (Tuberculosis):** The safety and efficacy of this combination in children under 15 years old haven't been established. Adolescents aged 15 and older typically receive the adult dosage.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Use in patients with these conditions requires caution, and a doctor must carefully assess risks and benefits. Treatment is contraindicated in cases of severe or acute hepatic impairment or a history of Isoniazid-associated liver injury.  If new or worsening liver damage occurs during treatment, the medication must be stopped immediately.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:  palpitations, edema, anxiety, insomnia, tingling in extremities, dizziness, vertigo, chest pain, skin rashes (including erythema, erythroderma, exfoliative dermatitis, localized rash, pruritus, and urticaria), sweating, changes in blood sugar levels, diarrhea, gastrointestinal pain, nausea, vomiting, increased liver enzyme levels, hypersensitivity reactions, joint pain (arthralgia), bone pain (ostealgia), tinnitus, cough, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), pneumothorax, fever, and skin rash.  Rare but serious side effects include toxic epidermal necrolysis.

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

This drug combination works synergistically to combat *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*:

* **Isoniazid:** Interferes with the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the bacterial cell wall, thereby hindering bacterial growth.
* **Rifampicin:** Inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, preventing the bacteria from producing essential proteins and thus inhibiting growth and replication.
* **Pyrazinamide:** The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's effective at killing *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, particularly during the initial phase of treatment.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, or any component of the formulation; history of severe adverse reactions to Isoniazid; concurrent use of certain medications (e.g., atazanavir, darunavir, etc.); severe hepatic damage; acute liver disease; acute gout.
* **Interactions:**  This combination may interact with several other drugs, including antacids, probenecid, cotrimoxazole, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, haloperidol, ketoconazole, theophylline, warfarin, levodopa, and corticosteroids.  Concomitant use of these medications requires careful monitoring by a healthcare provider.
* **Warnings:**  Hepatotoxicity (liver damage) is a serious risk, especially with Isoniazid.  Regular liver function tests are essential.  Other risks include coagulopathy, flu-like symptoms, hematologic effects, superinfections, dermatologic reactions, hypersensitivity, and peripheral neuropathies.  Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, porphyria, history of alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, or chronic gout.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult with their doctor as this combination is excreted in breast milk and might cause complications.
