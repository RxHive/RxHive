# Reboxetine
### Generic Name
Reboxetine

### Usage
Reboxetine is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD).  It's also indicated for maintaining improvement in patients who have initially responded well to treatment with reboxetine.  This means it helps both to alleviate depressive symptoms and to prevent relapse once symptoms have improved.  It's important to note that reboxetine is not a first-line treatment for depression and is usually considered after other antidepressants have been tried.


### Dosage

**Adults:**  Treatment typically begins with 4 mg twice daily (8 mg total daily dose).  After 3-4 weeks, the doctor may increase the dose to 10 mg daily if needed, based on the patient's response.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 12 mg. Older adults usually start with a lower dose of 2 mg twice daily (4 mg total daily dose), which may be increased to a maximum of 6 mg daily after 3 weeks if necessary.

**Children and Adolescents:** Reboxetine should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The dose may need to be adjusted in patients with liver or kidney problems. Patients with hepatic or renal impairment should start with a lower dose (2 mg twice daily, or 4 mg/day) and titration should be carefully monitored by their physician.


**Important Note on Discontinuation:** When stopping reboxetine after more than 3 weeks of treatment, it's crucial to gradually reduce the dose over 2-4 weeks. This helps minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms and allows for early detection of any recurrence of depressive symptoms.

### How it Works

Reboxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).  This means it primarily works by blocking the reabsorption of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation, alertness, and attention. By increasing the level of norepinephrine in the brain's synapses (the spaces between nerve cells), reboxetine helps improve mood and alleviate depressive symptoms.  It has a weaker effect on serotonin reuptake compared to other SNRIs, and it doesn't significantly affect dopamine reuptake.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Reboxetine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the medication, those currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and individuals with narrow-angle glaucoma.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use with MAOIs is strictly forbidden due to the risk of a hypertensive crisis.  Interactions are also possible with other medications, including CYP3A4 inhibitors (which can increase reboxetine levels) and ergot derivatives (which may increase blood pressure). Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Reboxetine is categorized as pregnancy category B. However, it's important to discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor if you are pregnant, planning pregnancy, or breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding is generally not recommended while taking reboxetine.
* **Other Precautions:** Exercise caution in patients with a history of seizures, urinary retention, or prostatic hypertrophy; those with liver or kidney impairment; patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or hyperthyroidism; and older adults.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of therapeutic effects is usually seen within 14 days of starting treatment. However, it may take several weeks to achieve full benefit.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking reboxetine?** A: It is advisable to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking reboxetine as it may interact negatively and exacerbate side effects. Consult your doctor for advice.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: How should I store reboxetine?** A: Store the medication as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I stop taking reboxetine suddenly?** A: No,  stopping reboxetine abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering the dose gradually.

* **Q:  Should I be concerned about suicidal thoughts?** A: There is a risk of increased suicidal thoughts in some individuals, especially at the beginning of treatment or when the dosage is changed. Report any changes in mood or thoughts of self-harm to your doctor immediately.
