# Reproterol
### Generic Name
Reproterol

### Usage
Reproterol is primarily used to treat acute bronchospasm, a sudden tightening of the airways in the lungs that can make breathing difficult.  This is often seen in conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It's a short-acting medication used to provide quick relief during an attack.  In more severe cases, like status asthmaticus (a life-threatening asthma attack), it may be administered intravenously.  While primarily used for acute situations, its role in preventing future attacks isn't typically the main focus.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Acute Bronchospasm (Oral):**  10-20 mg three times a day (TID) as the hydrochloride salt.
* **Acute Bronchospasm (Inhalation):** 1-2 inhalations (500 mcg/actuation) from a metered-dose aerosol, repeated every 3-6 hours as needed.
* **Status Asthmaticus (Intravenous):** 90 mcg administered over 30-60 seconds.  This dose may be repeated after 10 minutes if necessary.


**Children (6-12 years):**

* **Acute Bronchospasm (Inhalation):** 1 inhalation (500 mcg/actuation) every 3-6 hours as needed from a metered-dose aerosol.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor for appropriate dosing in such cases.


### Side Effects

* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Fine tremor of skeletal muscles
* Palpitations
* Muscle cramps
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Nervous tension
* Headache
* Peripheral vasodilation
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)


While less common, serious side effects can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning symptoms.

### How it Works

Reproterol is a selective beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist.  This means it works by binding to specific receptors in the lungs.  This binding stimulates the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a molecule that causes relaxation of the smooth muscles surrounding the airways. This leads to bronchodilation (widening of the airways), making it easier to breathe.  It also inhibits the production of leukotriene B4, a substance that contributes to airway inflammation.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Reproterol is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to reproterol or any component of the formulation, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, tachyarrhythmia (rapid heart rhythm), or pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland).

**Increased Risk:**  Reproterol can increase the risk of hypokalemia (low potassium levels).

**Use with Caution:**  Reproterol should be used cautiously in patients with hyperthyroidism, myocardial insufficiency, arrhythmias, susceptibility to QT prolongation, hypertension, severe asthma, diabetes mellitus, and in pregnant or breastfeeding women.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I double my dose if I miss a dose?** A: No, do not double your dose.  If you miss a dose, skip it and take the next dose as scheduled.

* **Q: How should I store reproterol?** A: Store as directed on the product label.  This typically involves storing it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions I should be aware of?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.  This is especially important for individuals taking other medications affecting the heart or lungs.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects may resolve on their own.  However, if you experience any concerning side effects, including severe or persistent symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.
