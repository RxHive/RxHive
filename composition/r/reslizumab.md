# Reslizumab
### Generic Name
Reslizumab

### Usage
Reslizumab is a medication used as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma in adults.  It's specifically indicated for those with a condition characterized by a high number of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell), known as severe eosinophilic asthma.  This means that the asthma is significantly impacting the patient's daily life and isn't adequately controlled with standard treatments. Reslizumab helps to reduce the inflammation associated with this type of asthma, improving lung function and reducing the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations (worsening of symptoms).  Currently, there is no approved use in children.


### Dosage
Reslizumab is administered intravenously (IV) as an infusion. The standard dosage for adults with severe eosinophilic asthma is 3 mg/kg of body weight. This infusion is typically given over a period of 20 to 50 minutes, once every four weeks.  Dosage adjustments are not specified for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment by the manufacturer's labeling.  The safety and efficacy of Reslizumab in children have not been established.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of Reslizumab are generally mild. However, serious side effects, though less common, can occur.

* **Common:**  The frequency of these side effects is not precisely defined in the available information.  These include the development of antibodies against Reslizumab, elevated creatine phosphokinase levels (an indicator of muscle damage), myalgia (muscle pain), and oropharyngeal pain (pain in the mouth and throat).

* **Serious (Less Common):** Anaphylaxis (a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction) is a serious side effect that has been observed.  Other less common side effects reported in post-marketing surveillance include the increased risk of certain malignancies (cancers) and helminth (parasitic worm) infections.


It's crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects, particularly those suggesting an allergic reaction (such as difficulty breathing, swelling, or hives).

### How it Works
Reslizumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by targeting interleukin-5 (IL-5). IL-5 is a cytokine (a signaling molecule) that plays a key role in the growth, activation, and survival of eosinophils.  In severe eosinophilic asthma, eosinophils contribute significantly to airway inflammation. By binding to and neutralizing IL-5, Reslizumab effectively reduces the number and activity of eosinophils in the airways, thereby decreasing inflammation and improving lung function.


### Precautions
Reslizumab is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to Reslizumab or any component of its formulation.

* **Anaphylaxis Risk:**  A boxed warning highlights the potential for anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction. Close monitoring during and after administration is essential, and immediate discontinuation is necessary if anaphylaxis occurs.

* **Malignancies and Infections:**  There's an increased risk of malignancies and helminth infections. Patients should be screened for these before starting treatment, and monitored throughout.  Existing helminth infections must be treated before initiating Reslizumab therapy.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy should be considered only when the benefits outweigh the potential risks, and other treatments are insufficient. The excretion of Reslizumab in breast milk is unknown, warranting caution during breastfeeding.

* **Other Medications:** While specific drug interactions are not extensively listed, it's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Reslizumab?** A: The time it takes to see improvement can vary.  Some patients may notice benefits relatively quickly, while others may require several infusions before experiencing significant relief.

* **Q: How is Reslizumab stored?** A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with your medication. Generally, it needs to be refrigerated.

* **Q: Can I drive after receiving a Reslizumab infusion?** A: It's advisable to avoid driving immediately following an infusion, particularly until any potential side effects have subsided.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Reslizumab?** A: Long-term studies are still ongoing, but current information indicates potential long-term risks are related to malignancy and infection. Regular monitoring is crucial.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss rescheduling your infusion.
