# Rabies Vaccine (Human Diploid Cell)
### Generic Name
Rabies Vaccine (Human Diploid Cell)

### Usage
The rabies human diploid cell vaccine is used to prevent rabies.  It's administered in two primary scenarios:

* **Pre-exposure prophylaxis:** This is given to individuals at high risk of exposure to the rabies virus, such as veterinarians, wildlife handlers, and laboratory workers who handle rabies virus specimens.  The pre-exposure vaccination aims to build immunity *before* any potential exposure.

* **Post-exposure prophylaxis:** This is crucial for individuals who have been bitten or otherwise exposed (e.g., scratches from a rabid animal, contact with rabies virus in a lab setting) to the rabies virus.  Post-exposure treatment aims to prevent the disease from developing *after* exposure.  This typically involves the vaccine alongside rabies immune globulin (RIG).


### Dosage

**Immunization Against Rabies Infection (Intramuscular Injection - IM)**

Dosage varies significantly depending on whether it's pre-exposure or post-exposure and whether prior vaccination has occurred:

**Adults:**

* **Pre-exposure:** Three 1 mL doses administered on days 0, 7, and 21-28.
* **Post-exposure (no prior vaccination):**  The standard regimen is five 1 mL doses on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28.  *Crucially*,  rabies immune globulin (RIG) is given with the first dose (day 0).  The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) also recommends a 4-dose regimen (days 0, 3, 7, 14) for non-immunosuppressed individuals. Wound cleansing with soap and water is the immediate first step.
* **Post-exposure (prior vaccination):** Two 1 mL doses on days 0 and 3. RIG is not administered.
* **Booster dose:** A 1 mL booster dose may be given to individuals with continuous or frequent risk of infection, based on antibody titer levels.


**Children and Neonates:**

* The dosage is generally the same as for adults, although for post-exposure prophylaxis in neonates, a 4-dose regimen (days 0, 3, 7, 14) is recommended, with a possible 5th dose on day 28 for immunocompromised infants.  Rabies immune globulin (20 IU/kg body weight) is administered around and into the wound(s) if feasible.  Wound cleansing is also the immediate first step.



**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common (>10%):**

* Injection site pain, soreness, swelling, redness (erythema), itching, burning
* Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea
* Headache, fatigue
* Enlarged lymph nodes (localized)
* Sore throat, low-grade fever, chills, muscle aches, dizziness, malaise


**Less Common (Frequency Not Defined;  Serious):**

* Guillain-Barr√© syndrome
* Anaphylaxis
* Encephalitis
* Meningitis
* Retrobulbar neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

The rabies vaccine works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the rabies virus.  These antibodies provide protection against future infection.  After vaccination, the body "remembers" the virus and can mount a rapid and effective immune response if exposed again.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  The vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the vaccine components (including human diploid cells, neomycin, gentamicin, amphotericin B), and in patients with a febrile illness (during pre-exposure therapy only).
* **Caution:** Use caution in patients with bleeding disorders, those on anticoagulant therapy, and those with compromised immune systems.
* **Interactions:**  Belimumab (a medication used to treat lupus) may decrease the effectiveness of the rabies vaccine; concurrent use should be avoided.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The vaccine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so use with caution during breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I eat or drink before getting the rabies vaccine?** A:  The vaccine can be administered without regard to food intake.
* **Q: How long does the rabies vaccine provide protection?** A:  The duration of protection varies, and booster doses might be necessary depending on the risk of exposure.
* **Q: What should I do if I'm bitten by an animal?** A: Immediately wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. Seek medical attention immediately for post-exposure prophylaxis.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of the rabies vaccine?** A: While rare, serious side effects can occur. However, the risk of rabies is far greater than the risk associated with the vaccine.  A healthcare provider can address specific concerns.
* **Q: How is the vaccine stored?** A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions provided by the manufacturer; generally, it needs to be refrigerated.
