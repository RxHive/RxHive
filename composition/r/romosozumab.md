# Romosozumab
### Generic Name
Romosozumab

### Usage
Romosozumab is a medication used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women who are at high risk of fractures.  This high-risk classification includes women with a history of osteoporotic fractures or those with multiple risk factors for fractures. It's also considered for women in whom other osteoporosis treatments have been ineffective or poorly tolerated.  The primary use is to increase bone strength and reduce the risk of fractures.


### Dosage
Romosozumab is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) as two consecutive 105 mg injections once a month for a total monthly dose of 210 mg.  This treatment is for a total of 12 months. The anabolic effects wear off after this period, so treatment should not exceed 12 months.  If osteoporosis treatment remains necessary after this 12-month course, a healthcare provider will likely prescribe an alternative anti-resorptive medication.  The medication should be administered by a healthcare professional.  Dosage adjustments are generally not needed for hepatic impairment. For those with renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 mÂ² or on dialysis), close monitoring for hypocalcemia is essential, along with ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation.  Romosozumab is not approved for use in children.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include arthralgia (joint pain).

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include:

*   Headache
*   Insomnia
*   Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
*   Cardiac disorders
*   Peripheral edema (swelling)
*   Skin rash
*   Hypersensitivity reactions
*   Injection site reactions (pain, redness)
*   Muscle spasms
*   Asthenia (weakness)
*   Neck pain

Less common but serious side effects reported include acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), angioedema (severe allergic reaction), cerebrovascular accident (stroke), dermatitis, erythema multiforme (severe skin rash), femur fractures (thigh bone fractures), hypocalcemia (low blood calcium), osteonecrosis of the jaw (bone death in the jaw), and urticaria (hives).  **Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works
Romosozumab works by inhibiting sclerostin, a protein that normally suppresses bone formation. By blocking sclerostin, Romosozumab activates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, which stimulates bone formation. This leads to an increase in bone mass density, making bones stronger and less prone to fractures.  It also, to a lesser extent, reduces bone resorption (the breakdown of bone tissue).


### Precautions
Romosozumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (e.g., angioedema, erythema multiforme, urticaria) to romosozumab or any component of the formulation, and in patients with uncorrected hypocalcemia (low blood calcium).

There is an increased risk of atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures, major adverse cardiac events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke), hypocalcemia, hypersensitivity reactions, and osteonecrosis of the jaw.  Romosozumab should not be started in patients who have had a myocardial infarction or stroke in the past year. The benefits and risks should be carefully considered in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. If a patient experiences a heart attack or stroke while on Romosozumab, the medication should be discontinued.  Patients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is insufficient.  Romosozumab is not recommended for women of reproductive potential. The safety of Romosozumab during breastfeeding is unknown. Good oral hygiene is advised during treatment.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take to see results from Romosozumab?** A:  While bone density increases during the 12-month treatment period, the full effects on fracture risk reduction may take longer to fully manifest.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible to reschedule the missed dose.

*   **Q: Can I take other medications with Romosozumab?** A:  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to check for potential interactions.

*   **Q: How should I store Romosozumab?** A: Follow your healthcare provider's instructions on storage.

*   **Q: Are there any specific dietary recommendations while taking Romosozumab?** A: Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake as recommended by your healthcare provider.

*   **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor immediately.  Some side effects may require discontinuation of the medication.
