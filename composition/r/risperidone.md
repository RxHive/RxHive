# Risperidone
### Generic Name
Risperidone

### Usage

Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat schizophrenia.  It's effective as both a monotherapy (sole treatment) and as an adjunct therapy alongside lithium or valproate for managing acute manic or mixed episodes associated with Bipolar I disorder.  Additionally, it's approved for treating irritability in children and adolescents with autistic disorder.  It's important to note that Risperidone is *not* approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis in elderly patients.

### Dosage

Risperidone dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and their response to the medication.  Always follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  The information below is for general understanding and should not replace professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Schizophrenia (Oral):**  Initial dose is typically 2 mg/day, divided into two doses.  This is gradually increased to a target dose of 4-8 mg/day, with adjustments made in increments of 1-2 mg/day as tolerated. Maintenance doses usually range from 2-8 mg/day.
* **Schizophrenia (Intramuscular - IM):**  Initial dose is 25 mg deep IM every two weeks.  Higher doses may be considered if needed, with a maximum dose of 50 mg every two weeks.  Oral risperidone is often administered concurrently during initial stages of IM treatment.
* **Bipolar Mania (Oral):** Initial dose is usually 2-3 mg/day, with gradual increases in 1 mg/day increments.  The effective dose range is 1-6 mg/day, with a maximum of 6 mg/day.  Treatment beyond 3 weeks may not be supported by established dosage guidelines.
* **Bipolar Mania (IM):**  The dosage regimen for IM administration in bipolar mania is similar to that for schizophrenia, starting at 25 mg every two weeks and potentially increasing to a maximum of 50 mg every two weeks. Oral supplementation is usually included.
* **Subcutaneous (SC) Extended-Release:** For schizophrenia,  an initial dose of 90 mg or 120 mg once monthly is given. This route should only be considered after successful oral titration, and supplementation with oral risperidone is generally not recommended.

**Children and Adolescents:**

Dosage for children and adolescents depends heavily on the condition, age, and weight, and requires careful titration under strict medical supervision.  Dosing guidelines exist for schizophrenia, bipolar mania, and irritability associated with autistic disorder, but these are not universally applicable and must be determined on a case-by-case basis.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  Individuals with these conditions should be closely monitored by their healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that works by blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with psychosis and mania, while serotonin plays a role in mood regulation and other brain functions. By blocking these receptors, risperidone helps reduce the symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar mania, and irritability associated with autism.  The precise mechanism through which it improves symptoms is still an area of ongoing research.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Risperidone is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to risperidone, paliperidone, or any component of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** Risperidone can interact with many other medications.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Particular caution is warranted with certain antidepressants, antihypertensives, and other antipsychotics.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Risperidone is a Category C pregnancy medication.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Increased mortality risk has been observed in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotics, highlighting the importance of appropriate patient selection.
* **Children:** Use in children should be carefully considered and monitored due to the potential for side effects.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are often necessary for patients with liver or kidney disease.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Risperidone abruptly?** A: No.  Abruptly stopping Risperidone can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always taper off the medication under the guidance of your healthcare provider.
* **Q: How should I store Risperidone?** A: Store Risperidone as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
