# Remoxipride
### Generic Name
Remoxipride

### Usage
Remoxipride is a substituted benzamide that was formerly used as an antipsychotic medication to treat schizophrenia and other psychoses.  It primarily targeted the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions.  While it showed some efficacy, its use was ultimately discontinued due to safety concerns.

### Dosage
Dosage information for remoxipride is no longer relevant as the drug is no longer marketed.  Prescribing information, if it were available, would have specified dosages based on individual patient needs, taking into account factors like age, weight, and the severity of the condition.  Different formulations (e.g., tablets, injections) might have had varying dosage recommendations.

### Side Effects
Because Remoxipride is no longer available, a complete list of side effects is difficult to compile definitively. However, the serious side effect that led to its withdrawal was **aplastic anemia**, a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by the failure of bone marrow to produce sufficient blood cells.  Other potential side effects, though not fully documented in the post-market era, likely included those typical of other antipsychotic medications. These could have encompassed:

*   Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as Parkinsonism, akathisia, and dystonia.
*   Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a rare but potentially fatal reaction.
*   Sedation or drowsiness.
*   Weight gain.
*   Dry mouth.
*   Constipation.
*   Orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure upon standing).


**It is crucial to remember that this information is based on historical data, and any specific side effects experienced would vary greatly between patients.**

### How it Works
Remoxipride functioned as an atypical antipsychotic, primarily by blocking dopamine D2 and D3 receptors in the brain.  These receptors are involved in transmitting dopamine, a neurotransmitter implicated in the development of psychotic symptoms. By antagonizing these receptors, remoxipride aimed to reduce the intensity of psychotic experiences. Its high affinity for sigma receptors may have also contributed to its atypical antipsychotic profile.


### Precautions
**Remoxipride is no longer available for prescription due to the risk of aplastic anemia.**  Therefore, the discussion of precautions is largely historical.  However,  it's important to emphasize that any potential use of remoxipride (if it were available) would have required careful monitoring for signs of blood disorders.  Interactions with other medications, particularly those affecting bone marrow function, would also have been a significant concern.
