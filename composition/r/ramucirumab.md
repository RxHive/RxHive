# Ramucirumab
### Generic Name
Ramucirumab

### Usage

Ramucirumab is a targeted cancer medication used to treat several types of advanced cancers.  Its primary mechanism involves blocking the action of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a protein that plays a crucial role in the growth of blood vessels that supply tumors. By inhibiting VEGFR2, Ramucirumab aims to restrict the blood supply to tumors, thereby hindering their growth and spread.

Ramucirumab is approved for use in the following cancers:

* **Metastatic colorectal cancer:** It's used in combination with another chemotherapy regimen (FOLFIRI) to treat patients whose disease has spread to other parts of the body.
* **Advanced or metastatic gastric cancer:** Ramucirumab can be used either as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel (another chemotherapy drug) to treat stomach cancer that has spread.
* **Advanced or relapsed/refractory hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer):** In this setting, Ramucirumab is primarily used as a single agent to treat patients whose cancer has progressed or hasn't responded to other treatments.
* **Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):** Ramucirumab has specific applications within NSCLC.  It's used in combination with erlotinib for first-line treatment of patients with specific EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitutions). It's also used in combination with docetaxel for patients whose disease has progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy.


### Dosage

Ramucirumab is administered intravenously (IV).  The specific dosage depends on the type of cancer being treated and whether it's used alone or in combination with other therapies.  Dosage is typically expressed as milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg).

**Important Note:**  Before each infusion, premedication is usually necessary to help reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions. This often includes an antihistamine (like diphenhydramine) and, in some cases, dexamethasone and acetaminophen.

* **Metastatic colorectal cancer:** 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks, in combination with FOLFIRI.
* **Advanced or metastatic gastric cancer:** 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks, as a single agent or with weekly paclitaxel.
* **Advanced or relapsed/refractory hepatocellular carcinoma:** 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks as a single agent.
* **Metastatic NSCLC (first-line, specific EGFR mutations):** 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, in combination with erlotinib.
* **Metastatic NSCLC (post-platinum-based therapy):** 10 mg/kg on day 1 every 21 days, in combination with docetaxel.


Treatment continues until the cancer progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors such as kidney or liver function, and the occurrence of specific side effects (see Dosage Adjustments section).  This information is for general knowledge and should not be used for self-medication. Always follow your doctor's prescription and instructions.

### Side Effects

Ramucirumab, like many cancer medications, can cause side effects. The frequency and severity vary from person to person.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Insomnia
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Hypoalbuminemia (low blood albumin)
* Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium)
* Hyponatremia (low blood sodium)
* Abdominal pain
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Proteinuria (protein in the urine)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen)
* Epistaxis (nosebleed)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Arterial thromboembolic events (blood clots in arteries)
* Gastrointestinal perforation (hole in the gastrointestinal tract)
* Hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Severe hypertension (dangerously high blood pressure)
* Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) â€“ a neurological condition
* Nephrotic syndrome (kidney damage)
* Wound healing complications


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Ramucirumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2).  VEGFR2 is a protein found on the surface of cells that line blood vessels.  It plays a crucial role in the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), a process essential for tumor growth.  By binding to VEGFR2, Ramucirumab blocks the action of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), preventing them from stimulating the growth of new blood vessels that feed the tumor.  This ultimately reduces the tumor's blood supply, slowing down its growth and potentially leading to tumor shrinkage.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Ramucirumab is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ramucirumab may interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ramucirumab is a Category C pregnancy drug, meaning it may cause harm to a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for three months afterward.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for two months after the final dose.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.
* **Specific Warnings:** Ramucirumab increases the risk of various side effects, including arterial thromboembolic events, gastrointestinal perforation, hemorrhage, hypertension, infusion reactions, PRES, proteinuria/nephrotic syndrome, impaired wound healing, and thyroid dysfunction. Close monitoring is necessary during treatment.  Before elective surgery, Ramucirumab should be withheld for 28 days and not restarted until the wound is adequately healed.
