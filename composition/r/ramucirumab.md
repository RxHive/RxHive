**How it Works:** Ramucirumab is a VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) antagonist.  Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a protein that plays a critical role in the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).  Cancer cells rely heavily on angiogenesis for growth and spread. By blocking VEGFR-2, ramucirumab inhibits the action of VEGF, thus reducing the formation of new blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients, ultimately hindering tumor growth and spread.
