# Ramelteon
### Generic Name
Ramelteon

### Usage
Ramelteon is primarily used to treat insomnia characterized by difficulty falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia).  It's not effective for treating difficulty staying asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia) or waking up too early.  It works by mimicking the effects of melatonin, a natural hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles.


### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical dose is 8 mg taken orally once daily, within 30 minutes of bedtime.  Do not exceed 8 mg per day.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of ramelteon in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is specifically recommended for mild or moderate hepatic impairment, however, caution is advised.  Ramelteon is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Somnolence (sleepiness)
* Fatigue
* Worsening of insomnia
* Depression
* Nausea
* Taste perversion
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Upper respiratory infection


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Complex sleep-related behaviors (sleepwalking, sleep-driving, sleep-eating, etc.)  These behaviors can be dangerous.
* Increased prolactin levels
* Decreased testosterone levels

**Important Note:** If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist. This means it binds to and activates specific melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2) in the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus. This area plays a critical role in regulating the body's natural sleep-wake cycle (circadian rhythm).  By activating these receptors, ramelteon promotes sleep onset.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to ramelteon or its components.
* History of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) with previous ramelteon use.
* Concurrent use with the drug fluvoxamine (a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor).

**Warnings and Interactions:**

* Use caution in patients with hepatic impairment, depression, respiratory compromise (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea), or those taking other CYP1A2 inhibitors.
* Ramelteon may interact with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., alcohol, opioids, sedatives, certain antidepressants), potentially leading to increased sedation or respiratory depression. Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants while taking ramelteon.
* Ramelteon can increase prolactin levels.  Monitor for symptoms such as amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), galactorrhea (abnormal milk production), decreased libido, or fertility problems.
* The risk of sleep-related complex behaviors is increased. Patients should be advised to avoid driving or operating machinery after taking ramelteon.

**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**

Ramelteon is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Its use during pregnancy should be avoided unless the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.  It's unknown whether ramelteon is excreted in breast milk; caution is advised if breastfeeding. Monitor infants for somnolence and feeding problems.  Consider pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 25 hours after the last dose to minimize exposure to the infant.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for ramelteon to work?** A: Ramelteon should be taken 30 minutes before bedtime. Effects should be seen relatively quickly.

* **Q: Can I take ramelteon with other medications?** A:  Consult your doctor before taking ramelteon with any other medications, especially other sedatives, CNS depressants, or CYP1A2 inhibitors.

* **Q: How should I store ramelteon?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Simply take your next dose as scheduled.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking ramelteon?** A: No. Avoid alcohol consumption while on ramelteon due to the risk of increased sedation and respiratory depression.

* **Q: Is ramelteon habit-forming?** A: Ramelteon is not considered a controlled substance and has not shown high potential for abuse or dependence in clinical trials. However, it is important to use it as directed by your doctor and not exceed the recommended dosage.

* **Q: How long can I take ramelteon?** A: The duration of treatment should be determined by your doctor, but generally it should not be taken long term without regular review.  Itâ€™s usually only recommended for short-term use to treat specific episodes of insomnia.
