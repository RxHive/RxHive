# Rupatadine
### Generic Name
Rupatadine

### Usage
Rupatadine is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives).  Allergic rhinitis involves inflammation of the nasal passages, causing symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes. Chronic idiopathic urticaria is a skin condition characterized by recurrent hives and itching.  Rupatadine helps alleviate these symptoms by targeting the underlying allergic responses.

### Dosage

**Adults (Allergic Rhinitis & Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria):** The usual dose is 10 mg once daily (OD) orally, as a tablet.  This should not exceed 10 mg per day.

**Children (Allergic Rhinitis & Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria):** Dosage depends on weight:

* **10-25 kg:** 2.5 mg once daily (OD) orally.  Do not exceed 2.5 mg/day.
* **>25 kg:** 5 mg once daily (OD) orally.  Do not exceed 5 mg/day.
* **Children aged 12 and older:**  Follow the adult dosage.

**Dosage Forms:** Rupatadine is available in tablet and oral solution (liquid) forms.  Always follow the instructions provided with your prescription and use the appropriate measuring device for the liquid form.  

**Dosage Adjustments:** Rupatadine is not recommended for patients with moderate to severe hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Dry mouth
* Gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and intestines)
* Allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eye's conjunctiva)
* Prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram (ECG) â€“ this is a heart rhythm abnormality and requires monitoring.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  While less frequent,  side effects such as anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, or throat), and other serious cardiac events have been reported.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious adverse effects.  The complete list of possible side effects is extensive, and consulting the patient information leaflet or your doctor is recommended.


### How it Works

Rupatadine is a second-generation antihistamine and a platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist.  It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions, at the H1 receptors. This helps reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and urticaria. It also blocks PAF, another inflammatory mediator, which further contributes to its anti-allergic effects.  The combined action of blocking histamine and PAF helps reduce inflammation and the associated symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Rupatadine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components; those with a history of QT prolongation or torsades de pointes (a type of irregular heartbeat); those with a history of cardiac arrhythmias; those concurrently taking CYP3A4 inhibitors or other QT-prolonging drugs; and individuals with certain rare hereditary galactose or fructose intolerance.
* **Interactions:** Concomitant use with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., alcohol, sedatives) may increase the risk of drowsiness. Avoid these combinations.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of Rupatadine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not established. Avoid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution in older adults due to the increased risk of adverse events.
* **Cardiac Risk:** Rupatadine can prolong the QT interval on an ECG, increasing the risk of arrhythmias.  Patients with pre-existing heart conditions or electrolyte imbalances should use it with caution and under medical supervision.
