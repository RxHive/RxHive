# Retapamulin
### Generic Name
Retapamulin

### Usage
Retapamulin is a topical antibiotic used to treat impetigo.  Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection, commonly caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* (often methicillin-susceptible) or *Streptococcus pyogenes*.  Retapamulin is specifically indicated for use in adults and children aged 9 months and older.  It's important to note that this medication is for external use only on the skin and should not be ingested or used in other areas of the body.

### Dosage
Retapamulin is available as a 1% ointment.  For both adults and children aged 9 months and older with impetigo, the recommended dosage is a thin layer applied to the affected area twice daily (BID) for five days. The total treatment area shouldn't exceed 100 cmÂ² of total body surface area.  Use in children under 9 months is considered off-label and requires careful consideration by a healthcare professional.  No dosage adjustments are typically needed for patients with hepatic or renal impairment due to the low systemic absorption of the medication.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of users) may include:

* Headache
* Eczema
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Application-site irritation
* Application-site itching (pruritus)
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports include:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Application-site burning
* Application-site pain
* Contact dermatitis
* Epistaxis (nosebleed)
* Erythema (redness)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Increased creatine phosphokinase levels (an enzyme in the muscles)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works
Retapamulin belongs to the pleuromutilin class of antibiotics. It works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.  Specifically, it binds to a unique site (protein L3) on the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, preventing the formation of functional ribosomes necessary for bacterial growth and survival. This action primarily inhibits the growth of *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococcus pyogenes*, the main culprits in impetigo.  It's mainly bacteriostatic (stops bacterial growth) rather than bactericidal (kills bacteria).

### Precautions
While generally safe, certain precautions should be observed:

* **Contraindications:** Currently, no specific contraindications are listed by the manufacturer. However,  a history of allergy to retapamulin or pleuromutilins should be carefully evaluated.
* **Interactions:**  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors could potentially increase retapamulin serum concentration.  Discuss any other medications you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Retapamulin is categorized as pregnancy category B (animal studies showed no risk, but human studies are lacking). Its excretion in breast milk is unknown. Consult your doctor regarding use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Superinfection:**  There is a risk of fungal or bacterial superinfection (secondary infections), including *Clostridioides difficile*-associated diarrhea. 
* **Skin Irritation:** Retapamulin can cause skin irritation at the application site. Monitor the area closely and stop use if significant irritation develops.
* **External Use Only:** This medication is strictly for external use on the skin only. Avoid contact with eyes, mouth, and other mucous membranes.
