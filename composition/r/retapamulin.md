# Retapamulin

**Generic Name:** Retapamulin

**Usage:** Retapamulin is a topical antibiotic used to treat impetigo, a bacterial skin infection.  It's typically applied directly to the affected skin area.  It is *not* for treating other types of bacterial infections, such as strep throat or pneumonia.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects of retapamulin include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Skin irritation (redness, dryness, itching)
* Pain at the application site

Less common but more serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention. These may include allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).

**How it Works:** Retapamulin is a pleuromutilin antibiotic.  It works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, thereby preventing the bacteria from multiplying and spreading the infection.  Specifically, it binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, disrupting the process of translation and halting bacterial growth.  This mechanism is different from many other antibiotics, making it potentially effective against bacteria resistant to other drug classes.
