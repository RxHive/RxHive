# Recombinant Human Luteinizing hormone

**Generic Name:** Recombinant Human Luteinizing Hormone (rhLH)  *(Note: There isn't a single generic name widely used.  Products containing rhLH may have different brand names.)*

**Usage:**  rhLH is primarily used in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) to stimulate ovulation in women undergoing fertility treatment. Specifically, it's used in situations where the body isn't producing sufficient LH to trigger the release of a mature egg (ovulation). It might be used alone or in combination with other fertility medications like follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).  Off-label uses may exist, but these should be discussed with a physician.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the dosage and individual response, but some common ones include:

* **Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS):** This is a serious complication characterized by enlarged ovaries, abdominal pain, fluid buildup, and potentially life-threatening complications.  It's a significant risk associated with any ovulation-inducing medication.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Breast tenderness:**
* **Mood swings:**
* **Weight changes:**
* **Multiple pregnancies:** A higher risk of twins or higher-order multiples exists due to the stimulation of multiple follicles.

Serious, though less common, side effects include thromboembolic events (blood clots), allergic reactions, and ovarian torsion (twisting of the ovary).

**How it Works:**  rhLH is a bioengineered version of the naturally occurring human luteinizing hormone. LH plays a crucial role in the menstrual cycle, specifically triggering ovulation.  By administering rhLH, the physician aims to mimic the natural surge of LH needed to cause the release of a mature egg from the follicle in the ovary. This allows for timing of procedures like intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF).


**FAQs:**

* **Is rhLH the same as hCG?** No, while both LH and hCG trigger ovulation, they are different hormones.  hCG is often used in the final stages of ovulation induction, while rhLH is more commonly used earlier in the stimulation process. They have slightly different structures and actions.
* **What are the risks of taking rhLH?** The most significant risk is OHSS.  Careful monitoring by a physician is crucial to minimize this risk. Other risks include multiple pregnancies and the side effects listed above.
* **How is rhLH administered?** It's typically injected subcutaneously (under the skin) or intramuscularly (into the muscle).
* **Who should not use rhLH?** Women with certain medical conditions, such as severe kidney or liver disease, uncontrolled thyroid problems, or unexplained uterine bleeding, should generally not use rhLH.  It's crucial to discuss medical history with a fertility specialist before starting treatment.
* **How is the dosage determined?** Dosage is individualized based on factors like age, ovarian response, and medical history. It's determined and monitored by a reproductive endocrinologist or fertility specialist.
* **What is the cost of rhLH?** The cost can vary significantly depending on the brand, dosage, and location.  It's advisable to discuss costs with your doctor and insurance provider.
