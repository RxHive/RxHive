# Regular Insulin
### Generic Name
Regular Insulin

### Usage
Regular insulin, also known as soluble insulin or neutral insulin, is a short-acting insulin used primarily to manage blood sugar levels in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Its primary role is to help the body use glucose (sugar) for energy.  It's often used as part of a comprehensive diabetes management plan, sometimes in combination with intermediate- or long-acting insulin.  Beyond diabetes management, regular insulin has off-label uses in several critical care settings, including:

* **Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA):**  A serious complication of diabetes characterized by dangerously high blood sugar and ketones. Regular insulin is crucial for treating DKA, typically administered intravenously.
* **Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS):** Another severe diabetic complication involving extremely high blood sugar and dehydration.  Similar to DKA, IV regular insulin plays a key role in treatment.
* **Hyperkalemia:**  High potassium levels in the blood. Regular insulin, given with glucose, helps move potassium into cells, temporarily lowering blood potassium.  This is a short-term management strategy.
* **Calcium-channel blocker or beta-blocker overdose:** In cases of overdose, regular insulin may be used to help manage the resulting cardiovascular effects.
* **Cadaveric organ recovery:** During the process of organ donation, regular insulin may be used to stabilize blood sugar levels in the donor.


### Dosage

Dosage of regular insulin is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's age, weight, overall health, type of diabetes, and the specific medical condition being treated.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  The following are general guidelines, not substitutes for professional medical advice:

**Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (Subcutaneous):**

* **Initial Dose:**  Typically starts low (0.2-0.6 units/kg/day) in divided doses to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, gradually increasing as needed.
* **Maintenance Dose:** Ranges from 0.4 to 1 unit/kg/day, divided into multiple doses throughout the day.
* **Children and Adolescents:**  Dosage adjustments are frequently needed during puberty due to hormonal changes.

**Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Subcutaneous):**

* **Initial Dose:** Usually starts lower than in type 1, often 4-6 units or 0.1 unit/kg before the largest meal.
* **Maintenance Dose:**  Adjusted based on blood sugar monitoring, aiming for target glucose levels.

**Intravenous (IV) Administration:** Dosages for IV administration are typically calculated based on weight and the specific medical condition (DKA, HHS, hyperkalemia, etc.).  This route requires close monitoring of blood sugar and potassium levels.  Specific protocols for IV insulin administration in critical care settings should be strictly adhered to.

**Important Note:**  Conversion from other insulin regimens (e.g., insulin pump) to regular insulin requires careful titration under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of regular insulin are generally related to its effect on blood sugar and may include:

* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar): This is the most common and potentially serious side effect. Symptoms include shakiness, sweating, dizziness, confusion, and rapid heartbeat.
* Injection site reactions: Redness, swelling, itching, or pain at the injection site.
* Weight gain: Insulin can stimulate appetite and fat storage.
* Hypokalemia (low potassium): Particularly with IV administration.

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions:  These range from mild skin reactions to severe, life-threatening anaphylaxis.
* Lipohypertrophy or lipoatrophy:  Changes in the fat tissue at injection sites.

If any side effects occur, especially severe ones, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Regular insulin is a nearly identical copy of the insulin your body naturally produces.  It works by binding to specific receptors on cells throughout the body, which signals cells to take up glucose from the bloodstream. This lowers blood sugar levels and provides energy to cells.  Regular insulin also influences metabolism of fats and proteins.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Regular insulin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to insulin or any of its components, and should not be used during episodes of hypoglycemia.
* **Interactions:**  Many medications can interact with regular insulin, either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While generally safe, insulin requirements often change during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Close monitoring and dose adjustments are necessary.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Insulin metabolism and clearance can be affected by liver and kidney disease, potentially necessitating dose adjustments.  This should be managed under medical supervision.
* **Other Warnings:** Carefully monitor blood sugar levels, especially during initial treatment or after dose adjustments.  Learn to recognize and manage symptoms of hypoglycemia.  Always rotate injection sites to prevent lipodystrophy.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does regular insulin last?** A: Regular insulin has a relatively short duration of action, typically lasting 3-6 hours.

* **Q: Can I mix regular insulin with other insulins?** A: Yes, it's often mixed with intermediate-acting insulins, but always follow proper mixing techniques to ensure accurate dosing and avoid precipitation.

* **Q: How should I store regular insulin?** A: Store unopened vials in the refrigerator. Once opened, store at room temperature and discard after a specified period (check the product label). Avoid freezing.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience hypoglycemia?** A: Immediately consume a fast-acting carbohydrate source (e.g., glucose tablets, fruit juice) and follow your prescribed hypoglycemia management plan.  Seek medical attention if symptoms are severe or don't improve.

* **Q: Can I stop taking regular insulin without consulting my doctor?** A: No, abruptly stopping insulin can be dangerous. Always consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your medication regimen.
