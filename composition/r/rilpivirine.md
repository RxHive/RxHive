# Rilpivirine
### Generic Name
Rilpivirine

### Usage
Rilpivirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.  Its primary use is in combination with other antiretroviral medications.  It's particularly indicated for:

* **Antiretroviral treatment-naive patients:**  Individuals who have never received antiretroviral therapy (ART) before.  In this population, rilpivirine is used as part of a combination regimen to suppress HIV replication.
* **Antiretroviral treatment-experienced patients in combination with cabotegravir:** Rilpivirine, in conjunction with cabotegravir, offers a long-acting injectable option for patients already successfully managing their HIV with a stable regimen, showing viral suppression, and without resistance to either drug.  This combination requires an initial oral lead-in phase to assess tolerability.

It's crucial to understand that rilpivirine is *always* used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs; it is never a monotherapy treatment for HIV.

### Dosage

**Adults (≥35 kg):**

* **HIV-1 infection (Treatment-naive):** The usual dose is 25 mg orally once daily.  This should be taken with a high-calorie meal.  Adjustments are necessary if co-administered with rifabutin (see Dosage Adjustments below).  Use of rilpivirine-based regimens should be avoided in patients with pre-ART CD4 counts <200 cells/mm³ and/or HIV RNA titer >100,000 copies/mL.
* **Combination therapy with Cabotegravir:** An oral lead-in dose of 25 mg once daily, combined with oral cabotegravir, is given for at least 28 days before transitioning to the injectable form.  Bridging oral doses are also used if injectable doses are missed by more than 7 days.

**Pediatric Patients (≥12 years, ≥35 kg):**

* The dose is 25 mg orally once daily, always in combination with other antiretroviral agents.  Rilpivirine is not generally recommended for children younger than 12 or weighing less than 35 kg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for mild to moderate impairment.  Dosage adjustments for severe impairment are not established.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for mild to moderate impairment. Use with caution in severe or end-stage renal disease.
* **Rifabutin Co-administration:** When taking rilpivirine with rifabutin, the rilpivirine dose must be increased to 50 mg once daily, taken with a meal.  The dose should be reduced back to 25 mg once daily when rifabutin is discontinued.
* **Pregnant Patients:**  For pregnant patients on a stable, well-tolerated regimen with viral suppression prior to pregnancy, the standard 25 mg once daily dose can be continued.

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Rilpivirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).  It works by binding to the reverse transcriptase enzyme, a crucial protein HIV uses to replicate. By binding to this enzyme, rilpivirine prevents HIV from converting its RNA into DNA, a necessary step in the virus's life cycle.  This effectively blocks HIV replication and reduces the viral load in the body.  It doesn't require intracellular phosphorylation to function.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Rilpivirine should not be used with certain medications, including some anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), antimycobacterials (rifampin, rifapentine), proton-pump inhibitors (esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole), high-dose systemic dexamethasone, or St. John's wort.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Numerous drug interactions are possible.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Rilpivirine may increase the risk of depression, fat redistribution, hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, severe skin reactions, and immune reconstitution syndrome.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Rilpivirine is a Category B drug in pregnancy. While it's considered an option for pregnant women living with HIV, breastfeeding is not recommended due to the potential for HIV transmission through breast milk.
* **Use in Elderly Patients and Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution in these populations.  Specific dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on renal function.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Rilpivirine with alcohol?** A: While there aren't specific contraindications with moderate alcohol consumption, it's best to discuss this with your healthcare provider, as alcohol can interact with other medications you might be taking concurrently.

* **Q: How should I store Rilpivirine?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions or concerns about missed doses, particularly regarding the combination therapy with cabotegravir.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Rilpivirine on my own?** A: No, never stop taking Rilpivirine or any other HIV medication without consulting your doctor.  Stopping treatment abruptly can lead to drug resistance and a worsening of your condition.

* **Q: Is Rilpivirine a cure for HIV?** A: No, Rilpivirine is not a cure for HIV.  It is an antiretroviral medication used to suppress the virus and improve the quality of life for people living with HIV.  Consistent adherence to treatment is essential for viral suppression.
