# Riluzole
### Generic Name
Riluzole

### Usage
Riluzole is primarily used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.  ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. Riluzole doesn't cure ALS, but it can slow the progression of the disease and potentially extend survival time in some patients.  It achieves this by affecting the release of glutamate, a neurotransmitter implicated in the damage to motor neurons in ALS.  There are currently no other approved uses for Riluzole.

### Dosage

**Adults (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis):** The typical dosage is 50 mg twice daily (BID), taken orally.  The medication should be taken at least one hour before or two hours after meals.  For film-coated tablets,  allow the film to dissolve completely on the tongue and swallow the saliva; do not chew, split, or spit the film out. For suspensions or regular tablets,  follow the instructions on your prescription label carefully.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Riluzole in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, use caution in patients with liver problems (baseline liver enzyme levels elevated more than five times the upper limit of normal).  If liver problems develop during treatment, stop taking Riluzole immediately.  Close monitoring of liver function is crucial.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Oral numbness (hypoesthesia)
* Elevated ALT (liver enzyme) levels
* Weakness (asthenia)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in less than 10% of patients):**

* Drowsiness
* Insomnia
* Vertigo
* Hypertension
* Peripheral edema
* Tachycardia
* Decreased lung function
* Increased cough
* Eczema
* Pruritus (itching)
* Abdominal pain
* Flatulence
* Vomiting
* Xerostomia (dry mouth)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Urinary tract infection
* Severe neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Hepatic injury (liver damage)
* Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including hypersensitivity pneumonitis
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Hepatitis (acute and toxic)
* Renal tubular disease (kidney damage)

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Riluzole works primarily by reducing the release of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter.  Excessive glutamate can be toxic to motor neurons, contributing to the damage observed in ALS. By decreasing glutamate release, Riluzole aims to slow down the progression of neuronal damage. Riluzole also interacts with voltage-dependent sodium channels, further modulating neuronal activity.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Riluzole is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Riluzole or any of its components.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Liver function:** Riluzole can cause liver damage, so regular monitoring of liver enzymes is essential, especially during the initial three months of treatment.
* **Lung function:** Thereâ€™s a risk of interstitial lung disease, so monitor for symptoms like shortness of breath or cough.
* **CNS depression:** Riluzole can cause CNS depression; avoid activities requiring alertness (driving, operating machinery) if affected.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Riluzole is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are unknown. Consult your doctor before using it if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Drug interactions:** Riluzole can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by the CYP1A2 enzyme. Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking.

### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for Riluzole to work?**
A: The effects of Riluzole are gradual, and it may take several weeks or months to see any noticeable benefit.

**Q: Can I stop taking Riluzole suddenly?**
A: No, do not stop taking Riluzole abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Your doctor will help you to gradually reduce your dose if necessary.

**Q: How should I store Riluzole?**
A: Store Riluzole as directed on the prescription label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

**Q:  Is Riluzole a cure for ALS?**
A: No, Riluzole is not a cure for ALS. It is used to slow the progression of the disease and may extend life expectancy for some patients.
