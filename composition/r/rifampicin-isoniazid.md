# Rifampicin + Isoniazid

**Generic Name:** Rifampicin + Isoniazid

**Usage:**

This combination is primarily used for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), specifically pulmonary tuberculosis.  It's usually part of a multi-drug regimen, not used alone, to prevent the development of drug resistance.  The specific duration and dosage depend on the individual's condition, the type of TB, and the physician's recommendations.  It is usually administered daily.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, diarrhea.
* **Liver:**  Elevated liver enzymes (hepatitis), jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes).  This is a serious side effect requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Skin:** Rash, itching, skin discoloration.
* **Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, peripheral neuropathy (numbness and tingling in the extremities).
* **Other:** Flu-like symptoms (fever, chills), fatigue, discoloration of body fluids (urine, tears, sweat) to orange-red.

Rare but serious side effects include:

* **Severe liver damage:**  This can be life-threatening.
* **Blood disorders:**  Such as thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).
* **Allergic reactions:**  Including anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction).


**How it Works:**

Rifampicin and isoniazid are both antibiotics that work in different ways to kill *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the bacteria that cause TB.

* **Rifampicin:**  Inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis, preventing the bacteria from producing essential proteins needed for survival and replication.
* **Isoniazid:**  Inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are essential components of the bacterial cell wall. This weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to bacterial death.

The combination of these two drugs is more effective than using either drug alone because it reduces the chance of developing drug-resistant TB.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long do I need to take this medication?**  A: The treatment duration for TB is typically 6-9 months, and it's crucial to complete the entire course of medication even if you feel better, to prevent relapse and drug resistance.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: Alcohol can increase the risk of liver damage, so it's generally advised to avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.
* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience jaundice, severe abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-colored stools, unusual bleeding or bruising, severe rash, or difficulty breathing.
* **Q: Can I take other medications while on this treatment?** A:  It's essential to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking, as some may interact with Rifampicin and Isoniazid.
