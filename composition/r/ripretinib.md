# Ripretinib
### Generic Name
Ripretinib

### Usage
Ripretinib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat adult patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).  Specifically, it's indicated for those who have already received treatment with three or more other kinase inhibitors, including imatinib.  This means it's used in cases where other medications haven't been as effective.  Ripretinib works by targeting specific proteins involved in the growth and spread of GIST cells.  Currently, it does not have notable secondary uses beyond this primary indication.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The standard oral dose for advanced GIST is 150 mg once daily (OD).  Treatment continues until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  It's crucial to withhold Ripretinib for at least one week before elective surgery and for at least two weeks after major surgery, ensuring adequate wound healing.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of Ripretinib in children have not yet been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin 1–1.5 times ULN and any AST), no dose adjustment is needed.  Manufacturer labeling doesn't provide dosage adjustments for moderate or severe impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dose adjustment is recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min.  CrCl between 30 and <90 mL/min doesn't significantly affect Ripretinib pharmacokinetics.  Information for CrCl < 30 mL/min is also not specified in manufacturer's labeling.
* **Toxicity Management:** Dose reduction to 100 mg OD may be necessary for managing adverse reactions.  Permanent discontinuation is considered if a patient cannot tolerate 100 mg OD. Specific adjustments for arthralgia/myalgia, hypertension, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES) are outlined in the prescribing information, generally involving dose reduction or temporary withholding until the side effects resolve.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Cardiac disorders (including left ventricular failure, ventricular hypertrophy)
* Cardiac failure
* Ischemic heart disease
* Reduced ejection fraction
* Anemia
* Neutropenia
* Skin cancers (keratoacanthoma, malignant melanoma, squamous-cell carcinoma)

If you experience any side effects, particularly serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Ripretinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  It works by blocking the activity of specific enzymes called tyrosine kinases, particularly KIT and PDGFRA. These kinases are crucial for the growth and survival of GIST cells. By inhibiting these kinases, Ripretinib interferes with the signaling pathways that promote GIST cell proliferation and survival, leading to tumor shrinkage or slowed growth.  It also inhibits other kinases, including PDGFRB, TIE2, VEGFR2, and BRAF.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ripretinib is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or any of its components.
* **Increased Risks:**  Patients taking Ripretinib have an increased risk of musculoskeletal toxicity (arthralgia and myalgia), PPES, new primary cutaneous malignancies, hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, impaired wound healing, and embryo-fetal toxicity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Ripretinib's metabolism can be affected by other drugs, particularly those that affect the CYP3A4 enzyme system.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking, including herbal supplements. Strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 should be used with caution and may require dose adjustments to Ripretinib.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Ripretinib may harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one week after the final dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least one week after the final dose.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Ripretinib with food?** A:  Ripretinib can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If less than 8 hours have passed since the missed dose, take it as soon as you remember.  If more time has passed, skip the missed dose and resume your regular schedule.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store Ripretinib?** A: Store Ripretinib as directed on the product label.
* **Q:  What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent.
* **Q: Is Ripretinib suitable for everyone with GIST?** A: No, Ripretinib is specifically for adults with advanced GIST who have already tried three or more other kinase inhibitors.
