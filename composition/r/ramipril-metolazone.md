# Ramipril + Metolazone

**Generic Name:** Ramipril/Metolazone combination (Note:  There is no single, universally approved generic name for this combination.  The names will vary by manufacturer.)

**Usage:**

This combination medication is used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) in patients who haven't achieved adequate blood pressure control with either ramipril or metolazone alone.  Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor that works to relax blood vessels, while metolazone is a thiazide-like diuretic that helps the body get rid of excess salt and water. The combined effect lowers blood pressure more effectively than either drug alone in some patients.  This combination is generally reserved for patients whose hypertension is resistant to treatment with other medications.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosages, but common side effects include:

* **Ramipril related:**  Dry cough, dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, altered taste, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), angioedema (rare but serious swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), decreased blood pressure (hypotension).  Rare but serious: kidney problems, neutropenia (low white blood cell count).

* **Metolazone related:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances (low potassium, sodium, magnesium), increased blood sugar, increased uric acid (leading to gout), muscle cramps.


**How it Works:**

* **Ramipril:**  Inhibits the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), preventing the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor (blood vessel tightener).  This leads to vasodilation (blood vessel relaxation) and reduced blood pressure. It also reduces fluid retention.

* **Metolazone:** Acts on the kidneys to increase the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, leading to a decrease in blood volume and blood pressure.  It's more potent than other thiazide diuretics.  The combination of reduced blood volume and vasodilation creates a synergistic effect on blood pressure reduction.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is this combination right for me?** A: This is a decision to be made by your doctor.  It's typically used only after other blood pressure medications have been tried unsuccessfully.
* **Q: What should I tell my doctor before taking this medication?** A: Inform your doctor about all your current medications, allergies, medical conditions (especially kidney disease, liver disease, heart failure, diabetes, or hyperkalemia), and pregnancy or breastfeeding status.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Alcohol can worsen the side effects of both ramipril and metolazone, especially dizziness and hypotension.  It's best to limit or avoid alcohol while on this medication.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A: Seek immediate medical attention for signs of angioedema (swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat), difficulty breathing, irregular heartbeat, severe dizziness, or persistent nausea/vomiting.
* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.
