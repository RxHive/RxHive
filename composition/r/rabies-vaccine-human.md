# Rabies vaccine + Human
### Generic Name
Rabies Immune Globulin (RIG) and Rabies Vaccine (various manufacturers)

**Note:**  There isn't a single "Rabies vaccine" generic medicine.  Several manufacturers produce rabies vaccines, and they may differ slightly in their formulations.  This information pertains to the use of rabies immune globulin (RIG) *in conjunction with* a rabies vaccine.  RIG provides immediate, passive immunity, while the vaccine provides long-term, active immunity. Both are crucial for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).


### Usage

Rabies immune globulin (RIG) and rabies vaccine are used together for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) following potential rabies exposure, such as a bite or scratch from an animal suspected of having rabies.  The goal is to prevent the development of rabies infection.  They are *not* used for treatment of established rabies infection, as the disease is almost always fatal once symptoms appear.  RIG provides immediate protection while the body develops its own immunity through the vaccine.

The vaccine alone is also used for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in individuals at high risk of rabies exposure, such as veterinarians, wildlife handlers, and laboratory personnel working with rabies viruses.


### Dosage

**Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):**

* **Rabies Immune Globulin (RIG):** The dosage of RIG is determined by body weight and is administered intramuscularly (IM) at the site of the bite wound, if possible; otherwise, another site is chosen.  A healthcare professional will calculate the precise dose.  It's usually administered as a single dose.

* **Rabies Vaccine:** The vaccine is administered intramuscularly (IM) according to a schedule determined by the healthcare provider.  A common regimen involves injections on days 0, 3, 7, and 14.  The specific vaccine and schedule may vary depending on the manufacturer's recommendations and the individual's situation.

**Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):**

The rabies vaccine is administered intramuscularly (IM) in a series of doses (usually three injections over a specific timeframe, as per the vaccine manufacturer's instructions).  Booster doses are then required to maintain immunity. A healthcare provider should determine the appropriate schedule.  RIG is not used in PrEP.


### Side Effects

**Rabies Vaccine:**

* **Common:** Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.  Mild fever, headache, muscle aches.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to anaphylaxis), neurological symptoms (rare).

**Rabies Immune Globulin (RIG):**

* **Common:** Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (similar to vaccine reactions), serum sickness (a delayed allergic reaction).

**Important:**  Any serious or unusual side effects should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

* **Rabies Vaccine:** The vaccine contains inactivated rabies virus. It stimulates the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the rabies virus.  These antibodies provide long-term protection against infection.

* **Rabies Immune Globulin (RIG):**  RIG contains rabies antibodies derived from human plasma. It provides immediate, passive immunity by directly neutralizing the rabies virus.  This immediate protection is crucial in the early stages after exposure, while the body's own immune response develops through the vaccine.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Individuals with allergies to any component of the vaccine or RIG should inform their healthcare provider.  A history of allergic reactions to other injections should also be disclosed.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The benefits of rabies prophylaxis generally outweigh the potential risks during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, the decision should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.

* **Other Medications:** Inform your healthcare provider of all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, before receiving the vaccine or RIG.  Interactions are rare but possible.

* **Neurological Conditions:** Individuals with pre-existing neurological conditions might be at slightly increased risk of neurological side effects from the vaccine.  This risk is still very low and needs to be carefully weighed against the risk of rabies.

* **Storage:** Vaccines and RIG must be stored appropriately according to manufacturer instructions to maintain their effectiveness.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the protection last after a rabies vaccine series?** A: The duration of immunity varies, and booster shots are often recommended. Consult your healthcare provider.

* **Q: Is rabies fatal?** A: Yes, rabies is almost always fatal once symptoms develop. This is why prompt PEP is crucial.

* **Q: What if I'm bitten by an animal that doesn't appear rabid?** A: It's always best to consult a healthcare provider.  Rabies may not always be immediately apparent, and testing of the animal may be required.

* **Q: Can I get rabies from a bat?** A: Yes, bats are a common source of rabies in many regions.  Even a minor scratch from a bat can warrant PEP.

* **Q: Are there different types of rabies vaccines?** A: Yes, there are several licensed rabies vaccines available, and their formulations may differ slightly. Your healthcare provider will choose the most suitable one.
