# Rabies vaccine + Human

## Rabies Vaccine (Human Diploid Cell Vaccine)

**Generic Name:**  Human Diploid Cell Rabies Vaccine (HDCV)  *(Note:  There isn't one single generic name, as different manufacturers may use slightly different production methods. HDCV is a common descriptor for the type of vaccine used in humans.)*

**Usage:**

* **Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP):**  Given to individuals at high risk of rabies exposure, such as veterinarians, animal handlers, laboratory workers handling rabies virus, and travelers to areas with high rabies prevalence.  The schedule typically involves a series of three injections over a month.
* **Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP):**  Administered to individuals after a potential rabies exposure (e.g., bite or scratch from a potentially rabid animal).  This involves a series of injections, often including rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) in addition to the vaccine.  The exact schedule is determined by the severity of the exposure and the vaccination history of the individual.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild and localized at the injection site.  These may include:

* Pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site.
* Headache
* Muscle aches
* Nausea
* Fever
* Fatigue
* Allergic reactions (rare but potentially severe, requiring immediate medical attention)


More serious side effects are rare.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe allergic reactions (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, hives).

**How it Works:**

The rabies vaccine contains inactivated (killed) rabies virus.  When injected, the vaccine stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against the rabies virus.  These antibodies provide protection against the virus if a person is exposed later.  The immune response is stronger and faster in those who have received the full pre-exposure series compared to those receiving post-exposure treatment.

**FAQs:**

* **How effective is the rabies vaccine?**  The rabies vaccine is highly effective at preventing rabies when administered correctly.  If given appropriately after exposure, it's very successful at preventing the disease.
* **How long does the immunity last?** Immunity from the pre-exposure vaccine series typically lasts for several years, but booster doses may be recommended depending on risk factors.  After post-exposure prophylaxis, the immunity developed is generally temporary.
* **What if I'm allergic to something in the vaccine?**  Inform your doctor of any allergies before receiving the vaccine.  Alternatives might be available, but these are less common.
* **Is the vaccine safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  The benefits of receiving the rabies vaccine usually outweigh the potential risks during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Consult with your doctor to discuss your specific situation.
* **What should I do if I think I've been exposed to rabies?**  Seek immediate medical attention.  Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water, and contact your doctor or local health department immediately.  Time is critical in rabies post-exposure prophylaxis.
