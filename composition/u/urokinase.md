# Urokinase

**Generic Name:** Urokinase

**Usage:**

Urokinase is a thrombolytic (clot-busting) enzyme used to treat several conditions involving blood clots.  Its primary use is in:

* **Pulmonary embolism (PE):** A blood clot in the lungs.  This is often considered a life-threatening condition and urokinase may be used when other treatments aren't immediately available or effective.
* **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):** A blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg.  Urokinase might be used in severe cases or when other treatments fail.
* **Peripheral arterial occlusion:** Blockage of an artery in the limbs.  Urokinase can help restore blood flow.
* **Acute myocardial infarction (AMI, heart attack):**  While less commonly used now than newer thrombolytics like tPA, urokinase may be considered in certain situations, particularly in cases where there are time limitations in getting access to tPA.  It's use in this indication is decreasing.
* **Other occlusive vascular diseases:**  Urokinase can potentially be used to treat other conditions involving blood clots in blood vessels.


**Important Note:** Urokinase's use is becoming less frequent due to the development of safer and more effective thrombolytic agents. It's generally reserved for situations where other treatments are unavailable or unsuitable.


**Side Effects:**

Urokinase carries a risk of significant side effects, including:

* **Bleeding:** This is the most serious and common side effect, ranging from minor bleeding to life-threatening internal bleeding (hemorrhage).  This risk is increased in patients with bleeding disorders, recent surgery or trauma, or those taking anticoagulants.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  A drop in blood pressure can occur, potentially leading to dizziness or fainting.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but potentially severe allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis, can occur.
* **Fever:** Fever is a relatively common side effect.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** These gastrointestinal side effects may occur.
* **Kidney problems:**  Urokinase can rarely damage the kidneys.


**How it Works:**

Urokinase is a serine protease enzyme that directly activates plasminogen, a protein in the blood. This activation leads to the formation of plasmin, an enzyme that breaks down fibrin, the protein that forms the meshwork of a blood clot. By breaking down the fibrin, urokinase helps dissolve the clot and restore blood flow.

**FAQs:**

* **Is urokinase better than other clot-busting drugs?** No, newer thrombolytics like tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) are generally preferred due to their better efficacy and safety profiles. Urokinase is often a second-line or last-resort option.
* **How is urokinase administered?** It's typically administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional.  The dose and infusion rate are carefully controlled.
* **Who should not use urokinase?** Patients with a history of recent significant bleeding, active internal bleeding, uncontrolled hypertension, severe liver or kidney disease, recent surgery or trauma, or those taking anticoagulants should generally not receive urokinase unless the benefits significantly outweigh the risks.  Pregnancy is also a contraindication.
* **What are the long-term effects of urokinase?** The long-term effects are primarily related to the risk of bleeding, which can potentially lead to complications depending on the location and severity.  Kidney damage is a rare but possible long-term consequence.
