# Urokinase
### Generic Name
Urokinase

### Usage

Urokinase is a thrombolytic (clot-busting) medication used to treat several serious conditions involving blood clots that block blood flow.  Its primary use is in managing acute occlusive peripheral arterial disease where a clot in a peripheral artery threatens the limb.  This means a clot is cutting off blood supply to a leg or arm, potentially leading to tissue death.  Urokinase helps dissolve the clot, restoring blood flow.

Urokinase also has important secondary uses, including the treatment of extensive acute proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) – a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg – and acute massive pulmonary embolism (PE) – a blood clot that blocks blood flow in the lungs.  In these cases, the drug's clot-dissolving properties help prevent serious complications or death.  Finally, it's used to clear clots from occluded central venous catheters (IV lines) or arteriovenous hemodialysis shunts.

### Dosage

Urokinase dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated and the route of administration (intravenous [IV], intra-arterial, or intracatheter).  It's crucial to follow the precise instructions provided by a healthcare professional, as incorrect dosage can lead to serious complications.

**Adult Dosage (examples only; consult prescribing information):**

* **Acute Peripheral Arterial Occlusion (intra-arterial):**  Typically begins with a high initial dose (e.g., 240,000 units/hour) for a few hours, followed by a lower continuous infusion (e.g., 60,000–120,000 units/hour) until the clot is dissolved or a maximum treatment duration is reached.
* **Acute Extensive Proximal DVT (IV):**  Usually starts with a bolus dose (e.g., 4400 IU/kg) over 10-20 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion (e.g., 4400 IU/kg/hour) for 12-24 hours or longer, depending on the patient's response.
* **Acute Massive Pulmonary Embolism (IV or intra-arterial):**  Dosage regimens vary considerably, often involving initial bolus injections followed by continuous infusions.  Intra-arterial administration requires specialized expertise and is typically performed in a hospital setting.
* **Occlusion of Central Venous Catheter (intracatheter):**  Two methods exist: a catheter lock method involves instilling a Urokinase solution into the catheter for a specific time, and an infusion method involves a continuous infusion over a longer period.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of Urokinase in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments for patients with impaired liver or kidney function are not explicitly stated in all manufacturer's labeling but may be necessary.  Always consult a physician.  Some manufacturers contraindicate use in severe hepatic or renal impairment.


### Side Effects

Urokinase, like all thrombolytic agents, carries a risk of bleeding.  The severity of side effects depends on factors such as the dose, route of administration, and the patient's overall health.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Gingival (gum) bleeding
* Microscopic hematuria (blood in the urine)
* Bleeding at injection or infusion sites
* Epistaxis (nosebleeds)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain)
* Cerebrovascular accident (stroke)
* Gastrointestinal hemorrhage (bleeding in the stomach or intestines)
* Hematoma (blood clots forming under the skin or in other tissues)
* Allergic reactions

**Note:** This list is not exhaustive. Any unusual bleeding or bruising should be reported immediately to a healthcare professional.  Severe side effects are rare but potentially life-threatening.

### How it Works

Urokinase works by directly activating plasminogen, a protein in the blood, into plasmin. Plasmin is an enzyme that breaks down fibrin, the protein that forms the meshwork of a blood clot.  By activating plasmin, Urokinase effectively dissolves blood clots, restoring normal blood flow.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Urokinase is contraindicated in patients with active internal bleeding, recent neurosurgery, acute bacterial endocarditis, aneurysms, recent stroke, recent major surgery or trauma, severe hypertension, and certain other conditions.  Patients with severe liver or kidney impairment (unless on renal replacement therapy) should also avoid Urokinase.
* **Drug Interactions:**  The use of Urokinase with other drugs that increase bleeding risk (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents) significantly increases the chance of hemorrhage.  Careful monitoring is needed if such combinations are unavoidable.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Urokinase is classified as Category B in pregnancy. This means studies in animals haven't shown evidence of fetal harm, but controlled studies in pregnant women are lacking. Its use during breastfeeding is generally not recommended.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults (over 75) are generally at increased risk of bleeding complications and should be monitored closely.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Urokinase administered?**  A: Urokinase administration depends on the condition.  It can be given intravenously, intra-arterially, or directly into a catheter.  A healthcare professional will determine the best method.

* **Q: How long does Urokinase treatment last?**  A: The duration of treatment depends on the condition and patient response, ranging from hours to days.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**  A: Report any unusual bleeding, bruising, or allergic reactions to your healthcare provider immediately.

* **Q: Can I store Urokinase at home?** A:  Urokinase is typically administered in a hospital or clinic and is not usually stored at home. Follow the storage directions provided by the healthcare professional or pharmacy.

* **Q: Is Urokinase safe?** A: Urokinase can be effective for its intended uses but carries significant risks, primarily of bleeding.  The benefits must outweigh the risks for it to be appropriate for a given patient.  Always consult your doctor.
