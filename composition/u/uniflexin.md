# Uniflexin

There is no medication officially called "Uniflexin".  It's possible this is a misspelling, a brand name specific to a certain region, or a colloquialism.  To provide accurate information, I need the active ingredient(s) of the medication you're referring to.  Many medications contain similar active ingredients and are used for similar purposes, so knowing the active ingredient will allow me to provide the correct details.

For example, if "Uniflexin" contains ibuprofen, I can give you information on ibuprofen.  If it contains naproxen, I can give you information on naproxen, and so on.  Please provide the active ingredient(s) so I can assist you properly.
