# Ulobetasol (Halobetasol)
### Generic Name
Ulobetasol (also known as Halobetasol)

### Usage
Ulobetasol is a potent corticosteroid used topically (applied to the skin) to treat several skin conditions.  Its primary use is for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, a common skin disease causing raised, red, scaly patches.  It's also effective in relieving the inflammation and itching associated with other corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses –  skin conditions that respond well to corticosteroids. These include various types of eczema, dermatitis, and other inflammatory skin problems.  The specific condition treated will influence the dosage and duration of treatment.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific condition being treated, the concentration of the Ulobetasol preparation (0.01% or 0.05%), and the patient's age.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Adults:**

* **Plaque Psoriasis:**  For 0.01% lotion, apply a thin layer once daily (OD) for up to 8 weeks. For 0.05% lotion or foam, apply a thin layer twice daily (BID) for up to 2 weeks. The maximum weekly dose is 50 grams for both concentrations. Treatment should stop once the condition is controlled. If no improvement is seen after 8 weeks (0.01%) or 2 weeks (0.05%), consult your doctor.

* **Other Corticosteroid-Responsive Dermatoses:** For 0.05% cream or ointment, apply sparingly to affected areas once or twice daily. The maximum weekly dose is 50 grams, and treatment should not exceed 2 consecutive weeks.  If there's no improvement after 2 weeks, consult your doctor.

**Children:**

* For children aged 12 and older, the 0.05% cream or ointment can be used to treat steroid-responsive dermatoses. Apply a thin layer once or twice daily.  The maximum weekly dose is 50 grams. Treatment should stop when the condition is controlled. If no improvement is seen after 2 weeks, consult your doctor.
* **Important Note:** The safety and effectiveness of Ulobetasol for plaque psoriasis in children under 18 have not been established.

**Forms:** Ulobetasol is available in various forms, including lotions, creams, ointments, and foams.  The choice of formulation depends on the specific condition and location of the affected skin.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Skin burning, itching, or irritation at the application site.
* Skin thinning (atrophy) at the application site.
* Telangiectasia (small dilated blood vessels).

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Adrenal suppression (suppression of the adrenal glands) if used extensively or over large areas of skin.
* Increased blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia).
* Acne.
* Skin discoloration.


If you experience any significant or persistent side effects, stop using Ulobetasol and consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Ulobetasol is a high-potency corticosteroid. It works by reducing inflammation and itching by suppressing the release of substances that cause these symptoms within the body. It binds to specific receptors in skin cells which triggers the production of proteins that inhibit inflammation. This leads to a reduction in swelling, redness, and itching.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ulobetasol should not be used if you are allergic to it or any of its ingredients. It is also contraindicated for certain skin conditions such as perioral dermatitis, rosacea, and untreated bacterial, fungal, or viral skin infections.  It's not to be used on the face, scalp, groin, or armpits unless otherwise instructed by a doctor.
* **Interactions:**  Ulobetasol may interact with other medications, particularly those affecting the immune system. Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of Ulobetasol during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  Avoid applying it directly to the nipples or areola if breastfeeding.
* **Children:** Use in children under 12 years is generally not recommended for plaque psoriasis and requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional for other conditions.
* **Long-term use:** Prolonged or extensive use can lead to adrenal suppression and other systemic effects.  Your doctor will monitor your progress if you use Ulobetasol for an extended period.
