# Uramustine
### Generic Name
Uramustine (Uracil Mustard)

### Usage
Uramustine is an alkylating antineoplastic agent, meaning it's a type of chemotherapy drug that works by damaging the DNA of rapidly dividing cells, like cancer cells.  Historically, it was used in the treatment of certain lymphatic malignancies, primarily non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  However, due to significant side effects and the availability of more effective and safer treatments, uramustine is no longer commonly used and was discontinued by the FDA in 1999.  It is rarely prescribed today.

### Dosage
Because uramustine is largely obsolete, specific dosage information is not readily available and should not be attempted without direct consultation with a qualified oncologist experienced in historical chemotherapy regimens.  Dosage would have varied depending on the specific condition, patient factors (such as age, weight, and overall health), and the clinician's judgment.  The drug was administered through various routes.

### Side Effects
Uramustine's use was limited due to its significant side effects. These included:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* **Bone marrow suppression:** This leads to a decreased number of blood cells, increasing the risk of infection, bleeding, and anemia.
* **Alopecia (hair loss):**  A common side effect of many chemotherapy drugs.
* **Mucositis (inflammation of mucous membranes):**  Can cause mouth sores and difficulty swallowing.
* **Other potential side effects:**  Fatigue, fever, skin rashes, and organ damage.


Serious, though less common, side effects could include severe bone marrow suppression, leading to life-threatening infections or bleeding.  Any adverse reaction should be reported to a doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Uramustine is an alkylating agent.  After activation within the body, it binds to the DNA of rapidly dividing cells, primarily affecting the guanine and cytosine bases. This binding creates cross-links in the DNA, preventing proper DNA replication and cell function.  This ultimately leads to the death of the cancer cells.  However, this mechanism also affects healthy, rapidly dividing cells, contributing to the significant side effects.

### Precautions
Uramustine carries significant risks and should only be considered under very specific circumstances and by oncologists well-versed in its historical use and limitations.  Given its discontinuation by the FDA, finding current prescribing information is difficult and the drug's use is strongly discouraged.  

* **Contraindications:**  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, individuals with severe bone marrow suppression, or those with severe liver or kidney disease should absolutely avoid uramustine.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Interactions with other medications, especially other bone marrow-suppressing drugs or those affecting liver or kidney function, are a significant concern and necessitate careful monitoring.
* **Vulnerable Groups:** The risks are amplified in children and older adults due to their already potentially compromised immune systems and organ function.


### FAQs

**Q: Is uramustine still available?**

A:  No. Uramustine was discontinued by the FDA in 1999 due to its significant side effects and the development of safer and more effective cancer treatments.

**Q: Why was uramustine discontinued?**

A:  The severe side effects, particularly bone marrow suppression and gastrointestinal toxicity, along with the availability of superior alternatives, led to its discontinuation.

**Q:  Can I get uramustine from an online pharmacy?**

A:  Obtaining uramustine from unofficial sources is extremely risky.  The drug is likely outdated and its quality cannot be guaranteed. Using outdated or improperly stored medication can be dangerous.
