# Urea (Topical)
### Generic Name
Urea (Topical)

### Usage
Urea topical is a keratolytic agent primarily used to soften and remove excess dead skin cells (hyperkeratosis). This makes it effective in treating a variety of skin conditions where thickened, dry, or scaly skin is a problem.  Its primary use is for debridement—the removal of dead tissue—from skin lesions, particularly when healing is hampered by infection, necrotic tissue, or debris.  Secondary uses include treating various hyperkeratotic conditions such as:

*   Dry, rough skin (xerosis)
*   Dermatitis (inflammation of the skin)
*   Psoriasis (a chronic autoimmune disease causing skin inflammation and scaling)
*   Ichthyosis (a group of genetic disorders causing dry, scaly skin)
*   Eczema (a group of inflammatory skin conditions)
*   Keratosis pilaris ("chicken skin," a condition causing small bumps on the skin)
*   Keratosis palmaris and plantaris (thickening of the skin on the palms and soles)
*   Keratoderma (a general term for thickening of the skin)
*   Corns and calluses
*   Damaged, ingrown, and devitalized nails


### Dosage
Urea topical comes in various forms (creams, emulsions, foams, gels, lotions, ointments, solutions, sticks, and suspensions) and concentrations (5-50%).  The specific dosage depends on the formulation, the condition being treated, and the severity.  Generally, it's applied to the affected area 1-3 times daily.  Always follow the instructions on your specific product label.

**Adult Dosage:**  Application varies depending on the formulation (cream, ointment, etc.)  Generally, apply to the affected area 1-3 times per day.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of urea topical in children haven't been established.  It shouldn't be used in children unless specifically directed by a pediatrician.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are needed based on hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, according to manufacturer labeling.  However, always consult a healthcare provider if you have concerns, especially if you have pre-existing kidney or liver conditions.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and transient (short-lived):

*   Transient stinging or burning sensation of the skin
*   Transient itching (pruritus)
*   Local irritation

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

*   Ischemic skin necrosis (death of skin tissue due to lack of blood flow), particularly with high concentrations or prolonged use.


If you experience any adverse effects, especially persistent irritation or unusual skin reactions, stop using the medication and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Urea works by breaking down the bonds between the dead skin cells in the stratum corneum (the outermost layer of skin). This process, called keratolysis, softens the thickened skin and allows for easier removal of dead cells, promoting healing and reducing scaling and dryness.  In the case of nails, it softens the nail plate, aiding in the treatment of ingrown or damaged nails.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Urea topical is contraindicated in individuals with clinically significant hypersensitivity (allergy) to urea or any of the formulation's components, and those with viral skin diseases.
* **Warnings:**  High concentrations or prolonged use can increase the risk of ischemic skin necrosis. There is also a potential for increased photosensitivity (sun sensitivity).
* **Use with Caution:** Use cautiously in breastfeeding women as excretion in breast milk is unknown.  Always consult a doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes, lips, and mucous membranes.  Do not use on irritated, infected, or open skin. Limit sun exposure during treatment and for a week afterward.  Discontinue use if irritation or redness occurs.
