# Ulipristal
### Generic Name
Ulipristal

### Usage
Ulipristal is primarily used as an emergency contraceptive to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure.  It's crucial to understand that Ulipristal is *not* a routine contraceptive method and should only be used in emergency situations.  It's most effective when taken within 120 hours (5 days) of unprotected sex.

Ulipristal also has a secondary, important application in managing uterine fibroids.  Specifically, it's used for pre-operative management of moderate-to-severe symptoms in adult women of reproductive age, and for intermittent treatment of these symptoms in women ineligible for surgery.  This involves reducing the size of fibroids and alleviating associated symptoms like heavy bleeding.

### Dosage

**Emergency Contraception:**

* **Oral:** A single 30mg dose should be taken as soon as possible, but within 120 hours (5 days) of unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure.

**Uterine Fibroids:**

* **Oral:** 5mg once daily for three consecutive months.  Treatment courses are limited to three months each.  The first course should begin within the first 7 days of menstruation. Subsequent courses should begin, at the earliest, in the first week of the second menstruation after completing the previous course.  A treatment-free interval of two menstrual cycles between courses is recommended.


**Pediatric Dosage (Emergency Contraception):** Ulipristal is not indicated for use in pre-pubertal girls.  Post-pubertal adolescents receive the same adult dose as above.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are needed for hepatic impairment in emergency contraception. For uterine fibroids, no adjustment is needed for mild or moderate hepatic impairment, but it's not recommended for severe impairment.  For both uses, renal impairment (moderate to severe) makes the use of Ulipristal inadvisable.

### How it Works

Ulipristal is a selective progesterone receptor modulator.  This means it interacts with progesterone receptors in the body, acting as both an antagonist (blocker) and a partial agonist (activator) depending on the context. In emergency contraception, it primarily delays or prevents ovulation by postponing the release of an egg from the ovary.  In uterine fibroids, its mechanism involves shrinking the fibroids by affecting their growth and reducing the impact of progesterone on them.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ulipristal is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, pregnancy, breastfeeding (for uterine fibroids), unexplained vaginal bleeding, certain cancers, and significant liver disease.
* **Interactions:**  Drugs that induce liver enzymes (like certain medications and herbal products) can decrease Ulipristal's effectiveness, while inhibitors of liver enzymes (like certain antifungals) can increase its levels.  Consult with your doctor about any other medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ulipristal is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it's contraindicated during pregnancy.  It's not intended to terminate an existing pregnancy. For emergency contraception use in breastfeeding women, the CDC guidelines suggest discarding breast milk for 24 hours after the dose. For fibroids treatment, breastfeeding is contraindicated.
* **Other Precautions:**  Bleeding irregularities and endometrial thickening are potential risks.  Regular follow-up appointments may be necessary, particularly when using it for fibroids.  Ulipristal does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use Ulipristal repeatedly?** A: No, it's not for routine use and repeated use within the same menstrual cycle is not recommended.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of Ulipristal (for uterine fibroids)?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't take two doses at once. Contact your doctor for advice if this happens frequently.
