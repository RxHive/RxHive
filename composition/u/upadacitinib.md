# Upadacitinib
### Generic Name
Upadacitinib

### Usage

Upadacitinib is a medication primarily used to treat several inflammatory conditions in adults and adolescents.  Its main applications are:

* **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA):**  It's used for moderately to severely active RA in adults who haven't responded adequately to or can't tolerate at least one TNF blocker (a type of biologic medication). It may also be used with methotrexate or as an alternative in some cases.

* **Psoriatic arthritis:**  Similar to its use in RA, it treats moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis in adults who haven't responded adequately to or can't tolerate at least one TNF blocker.

* **Ankylosing spondylitis:** Upadacitinib is indicated for active ankylosing spondylitis in adults who haven't had sufficient results from, or are unable to tolerate, at least one TNF blocker.

* **Ulcerative colitis:** It's used for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults who haven't responded well to or can't tolerate at least one TNF blocker.

* **Atopic dermatitis (eczema):** Upadacitinib treats refractory, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in patients aged 12 and older weighing at least 40 kg.  It's used when other systemic treatments, including biologics, haven't worked well or aren't suitable.


### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and their response to the medication.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis:**  The typical starting dose is 15 mg once daily.

* **Ulcerative colitis:**  The initial dose is usually higher (45 mg once daily) for 8 weeks (induction phase), followed by a lower maintenance dose (15 mg once daily, potentially increased to 30 mg).

* **Atopic dermatitis:** The starting dose is typically 15 mg once daily, and may be increased to 30 mg once daily if needed.

**Children (age 12 and older, weighing â‰¥40 kg) - atopic dermatitis only:** The starting dose is 15 mg once daily; this may be increased to 30 mg once daily if necessary.

**Dosage adjustments:**  The dosage might need to be adjusted for individuals with liver or kidney problems.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on your specific circumstances. Upadacitinib is an oral medication in tablet form.


### Side Effects

Upadacitinib, like other medications, can cause side effects.  These vary in frequency and severity.

**Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients in some studies):**

* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Acne

**Less common but potentially serious side effects:**

* Serious infections (including tuberculosis, pneumonia, herpes zoster)
* Blood disorders (lymphopenia, neutropenia, anemia)
* Liver problems (elevated liver enzymes)

**If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.** This list doesn't encompass all possible side effects; consult your doctor or pharmacist for complete information.


### How it Works

Upadacitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor.  JAK enzymes are involved in signaling pathways within the immune system that contribute to inflammation.  By blocking JAK enzymes, upadacitinib reduces the activity of these pathways, leading to a decrease in inflammation and the symptoms associated with the conditions it treats.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Upadacitinib is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to it or any of its components.

* **Interactions:** Upadacitinib can interact with other medications, including other immunosuppressants, live vaccines, and certain drugs metabolized by the liver.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.

* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Upadacitinib may harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 weeks after the last dose. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for 6 days after the last dose.

* **Specific populations:**  Older adults, individuals with liver or kidney disease, and those with a history of infections or blood disorders may require closer monitoring while taking upadacitinib.

* **Serious risks:** Upadacitinib carries a boxed warning about the risk of serious infections, malignancies, and thrombosis (blood clots).  Your doctor will assess your risk factors before prescribing this medication.
