# Urea

**Generic Name:** Urea

**Usage:**

* **Topical:** Urea is used topically in various concentrations (typically 5-40%) in creams, lotions, and ointments to treat dry, scaly skin conditions such as:
    * Xerosis (dry skin)
    * Psoriasis
    * Eczema (atopic dermatitis)
    * Ichthyosis (a group of skin disorders causing dry, scaly skin)
    * Keratosis pilaris ("chicken skin")
    * Calluses and corns (higher concentrations)
* **Oral:**  Urea is sometimes used orally as a medication, though less common for skin conditions. It's primarily used in specific medical scenarios like treating hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood) or for other conditions requiring the breakdown of nitrogenous compounds, but it is not typically used as a primary treatment in this manner.

**Side Effects:**

* **Topical:**  Generally well-tolerated, but may cause:
    * Burning or stinging sensation upon application (especially at higher concentrations)
    * Skin irritation, redness, or rash
    * Allergic reactions (rare)
* **Oral:** Side effects are more significant and depend on dosage and administration method; they can include: gastrointestinal upset, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and rarely, more serious complications due to its metabolic effects.  It is important to consult with a physician for such applications.

**How it Works:**

* **Topical:** Urea is a keratolytic agent.  This means it helps to break down the bonds between dead skin cells, making the skin softer and less dry and flaky. It also helps to increase skin hydration by drawing moisture from the air into the skin (hygroscopic).
* **Oral:** Urea undergoes metabolic breakdown in the liver and kidneys. It plays a role in the excretion of nitrogenous waste products. In the context of hyperkalemia, it's utilized to enhance the excretion of potassium.

**FAQs:**

* **Is urea safe to use?**  Topically, urea is generally safe when used as directed.  However, higher concentrations may cause irritation. Oral use should only be under strict medical supervision due to potential side effects.
* **Can I use urea on my face?**  Urea can be used on the face, but it's important to start with a lower concentration and a small area to test for any adverse reactions.  Follow product instructions carefully.
* **How often should I apply urea?**  The frequency of application depends on the product and the severity of the skin condition. Follow the instructions on the product label or your doctor's recommendations.
* **Can urea cause any long-term effects?** Long-term topical use is generally considered safe, but any significant irritation should warrant a discussion with a doctor or dermatologist.  Long-term oral use necessitates close medical monitoring.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** If you experience any significant irritation, allergic reaction, or other adverse effects, discontinue use and consult a doctor or pharmacist.
