# Ulipristal acetate
### Generic Name
Ulipristal Acetate

### Usage
Ulipristal acetate is primarily used for the emergency contraception, often referred to as the "morning-after pill." It works by delaying or preventing ovulation, thereby hindering fertilization.  It's most effective when taken within 120 hours (5 days) of unprotected sex, but its effectiveness decreases with time.  While primarily used for emergency contraception, research also explores its potential role in the treatment of uterine fibroids, a benign tumor in the uterus.  In this context, it aims to reduce the size of fibroids and alleviate associated symptoms like heavy bleeding. However, its use for uterine fibroids is not as widely established or readily available as its use for emergency contraception.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using ulipristal acetate for any purpose.

### Dosage
**Emergency Contraception:** The typical dose is a single 30mg tablet taken orally as soon as possible, but no later than 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sexual intercourse.  There are no specific dosage adjustments based on age or weight for emergency contraception.

**Uterine Fibroids:** Dosage for uterine fibroids varies significantly depending on the individual's condition and response to treatment.  It is typically administered orally, and the dosage and duration of treatment are determined and closely monitored by a healthcare professional. This is not an over-the-counter treatment and requires a prescription and medical supervision.  There are no pediatric formulations for this indication.

### Side Effects
* **Common Side Effects:** Headache, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, dizziness, vomiting, breast tenderness.
* **Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  Severe abdominal pain, changes in menstrual bleeding (heavier or lighter bleeding, prolonged bleeding), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), severe dizziness or fainting.  

**Important:** If you experience any serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM).  This means it works by blocking the action of progesterone, a hormone crucial for ovulation and the development of the uterine lining. In emergency contraception, this blockage delays or prevents the release of an egg from the ovary, thus preventing fertilization. In the treatment of uterine fibroids, the mechanism is more complex but involves suppressing fibroid growth by altering hormonal effects on uterine tissues.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Ulipristal acetate should not be used by individuals who are allergic to it or its components.  It may not be suitable for individuals with certain liver or kidney conditions.
* **Drug Interactions:** Ulipristal acetate can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements, you are taking.
