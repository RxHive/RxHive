# Unoprostone
### Generic Name
Unoprostone

### Usage
Unoprostone is primarily used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  These conditions involve an increase in pressure within the eye, which can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss if left untreated.  Unoprostone doesn't cure glaucoma or ocular hypertension, but it helps manage the condition and slow down potential vision damage.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical dosage for open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension is one drop of 0.15% unoprostone ophthalmic solution in the affected eye(s) twice daily.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of unoprostone in children have not been established, and therefore, it is not recommended for pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. This is likely because systemic absorption of unoprostone is low, minimizing the need for dose alterations based on these factors.  However, always consult a doctor for personalized guidance, particularly if you have pre-existing liver or kidney issues.

### Side Effects

* Conjunctival injection (redness of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inside of the eyelid)
* Eye redness (hyperemia)
* Dry eyes (xerophthalmia)


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Changes in tear production
* Eyelid changes
* Visual disturbances
* Decreased eyelash length
* Blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelid)
* Cataracts
* Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva)
* Corneal lesions
* Eye discharge
* Eye irritation

* Hemophthalmos (bleeding into the eye)
* Keratitis (inflammation of the cornea)
* Photophobia (sensitivity to light)
* Foreign body sensation in the eye
* Vitreous disorders
* Dizziness
* Headache

* Pain
* Diabetes mellitus (in rare instances)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Back pain

* Sinusitis


**Rare Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Hyperpigmentation of the eyelid or iris (darkening of the skin or eye color)
* Increased number of eyelashes (hypertrichosis)
* Acute elevation of intraocular pressure
* Color blindness
* Corneal deposits
* Corneal edema (swelling of the cornea)
* Corneal opacity (clouding of the cornea)


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Unoprostone is a prostaglandin analog. It lowers IOP by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor (the fluid inside the eye) through the trabecular meshwork, a structure in the eye that helps drain this fluid.  While the precise mechanism isn't fully understood, it's thought that unoprostone may also affect certain potassium (BK) and chloride (ClC-2) channels in the eye, further contributing to improved fluid outflow.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Unoprostone is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to unoprostone or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings:**  Increased risks of ocular pigmentation (darkening of the eye), bacterial keratitis (infection of the cornea), and macular edema (swelling of the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp vision), including cystoid macular edema, have been noted.

**Use with Caution:**  Unoprostone should be used cautiously in patients with intraocular inflammation or infection.


**Drug Interactions:** Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can potentially reduce the effectiveness of unoprostone, or conversely, enhance it.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Unoprostone is categorized as pregnancy Category C, meaning that the risks to the developing fetus are not fully known.  It is unknown whether unoprostone is excreted in breast milk, therefore, caution is advised for nursing mothers.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Unoprostone?** A:  The effects of unoprostone may vary, but many people notice a reduction in IOP within a few weeks of consistent use.

* **Q: Can I wear contact lenses while using Unoprostone?** A:  Remove contact lenses before applying unoprostone and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.

* **Q: How should I store Unoprostone?** A: Store unoprostone at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and excessive heat.

* **Q:  Can I stop using Unoprostone suddenly?** A:  No, do not stop using unoprostone without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation may cause a rebound increase in IOP.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Can I use other eye drops with Unoprostone?** A:  It's possible to use unoprostone concurrently with other eye drops, but maintain a gap of at least five minutes between applications to avoid dilution and reduce the risk of interactions.  Always consult your doctor or ophthalmologist for guidance on combining medications.
