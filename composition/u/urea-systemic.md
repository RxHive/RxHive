# Urea (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Urea (Systemic)

### Usage
Urea (systemic) is a medical food used to manage hyponatremia (low sodium levels in the blood) specifically associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).  SIADH causes the body to retain too much water, diluting the sodium in the blood.  This medication is indicated for both euvolemic (normal blood volume) and hypervolemic (increased blood volume) forms of SIADH-related hyponatremia.  It's crucial to understand that urea (systemic) is not a first-line treatment for all types of hyponatremia and should be used under the strict guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (SIADH-associated hyponatremia):**

* **Oral:** The initial dose is 15-30 grams per day, divided into one or two doses.  The dose is carefully increased (in 15-gram increments weekly) based on the patient's response, aiming for a safe and gradual increase in serum sodium levels.  The maximum daily dose is 60 grams.  The goal is typically a 4-6 mEq/L increase in serum sodium over 24 hours (maximum 8 mEq/L increase in any 24-hour period). In cases of symptomatic hyponatremia, a quicker, yet still carefully monitored, increase may be necessary (4-6 mEq/L within the first 6 hours, then maintained).  Rapid correction should be avoided to prevent serious complications like osmotic demyelination syndrome. Urea (systemic) is usually considered when fluid restriction alone isn't effective or feasible.

**Pediatric Dosage (SIADH-associated hyponatremia):**

* **Oral:** The starting dose for infants, children, and adolescents is 0.1-0.7 grams per kilogram of body weight per day. The dose can be adjusted, with a maximum of 1-2 grams per kilogram per day, divided into 3-4 doses.  Dosage adjustments are made under close medical supervision based on the child's response and serum sodium levels.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Therefore, close monitoring and careful titration are essential in such cases.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Mild stomach upset.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood).  This is a serious side effect that requires immediate medical attention.

It is crucial to report any adverse effects to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Urea (systemic) works by increasing the excretion of free water from the body.  This helps to increase the concentration of sodium in the blood, correcting the hyponatremia.  In SIADH, it also has a more specific effect by reducing the excretion of sodium in the urine, further contributing to sodium level normalization.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Currently, no specific contraindications are listed by the manufacturer.
* **Drug Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently reported. However, itâ€™s important to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of urea (systemic) during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  It should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Always consult with your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **General Precautions:** Patients should drink plenty of fluids unless advised otherwise by their physician.  Careful monitoring of serum sodium levels is essential throughout treatment.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I buy Urea (systemic) without a prescription?** A:  Yes, Urea (systemic) is classified as a medical food and is generally available over-the-counter (OTC). However, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before using it to ensure it is appropriate for your condition and to receive proper monitoring.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Urea (systemic)?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided on the product label.  Generally, medical foods should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Is Urea (systemic) safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use should only be undertaken under strict medical supervision, with regular monitoring of sodium levels.
