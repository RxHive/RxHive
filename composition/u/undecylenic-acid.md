# Undecylenic Acid
### Generic Name
Undecylenic Acid

### Usage
Undecylenic acid is a topical antifungal medication primarily used to treat fungal skin infections like tinea corporis (ringworm of the body), tinea pedis (athlete's foot), and tinea cruris (jock itch).  It's considered a fungistatic agent, meaning it inhibits the growth of fungi rather than killing them directly. While its primary use is for these common fungal infections, it's not typically used for other types of fungal infections or for systemic fungal diseases.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (cream, powder, spray) and the condition being treated.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  General guidelines are as follows:

**Adults:**

* **Tinea corporis and tinea pedis:** For creams and ointments containing 20-25% undecylenic acid, apply a thin layer twice daily (BID) to the affected area after cleaning and drying the skin.  Treatment may last up to four weeks.  For sprays (10-20% concentration), follow the product-specific instructions for application frequency and duration.
* **Tinea cruris:** Sprays (10-20% concentration) are commonly used. Apply twice daily for approximately two weeks.  Follow product-specific instructions.

**Children:**

* The safety and effectiveness of undecylenic acid have not been established for children under two years of age.
* For children aged two years and older, the dosage is generally the same as for adults, using the appropriate topical formulation. However, always consult a pediatrician before using any medication on a child.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment based on current manufacturer labeling. However, it's always advisable to consult a healthcare professional if you have concerns about existing liver or kidney conditions.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Skin irritation
* Rash
* Sensitivity at the application site

Less common, but more serious, allergic reactions are possible.  Stop using the medication and seek immediate medical attention if you experience signs of an allergic reaction such as swelling, difficulty breathing, or hives.

### How it Works
Undecylenic acid works by interfering with the growth and development of fungi.  Specifically, it inhibits the process of morphogenesis in fungi like *Candida albicans*, preventing them from changing shape and reproducing effectively. This inhibits the spread of the infection and allows the body's natural defenses to clear the fungal growth.  It doesn't kill the fungi outright, but it slows their growth enough for the body to overcome the infection.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Undecylenic acid should not be used by individuals with known allergies or hypersensitivity to undecylenic acid or any components of the formulation.
* **Self-Medication:** Avoid self-medicating. Consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment of fungal infections to ensure proper identification and effective management of the condition.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Undecylenic acid is classified as Category C during pregnancy.  This means that studies in animals have shown adverse effects, and the potential risks to a developing fetus are not fully understood.  It's crucial to discuss its use with your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.  The excretion of undecylenic acid in breast milk is unknown.
* **Topical Use Only:**  Undecylenic acid is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes and mucous membranes.  If accidental contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?**  A: Improvement may be seen within a few days to a few weeks, depending on the severity of the infection and the individual's response.  Consistent application is crucial.

* **Q: Can I use undecylenic acid with other medications?** A: Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies you are using.  Interactions are uncommon but possible.

* **Q: How should I store undecylenic acid?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as directed on the product label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: When should I consult a doctor?** A: Consult your doctor if the infection doesn't improve after several weeks of treatment, or if you experience any serious side effects.
