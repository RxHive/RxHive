# Ursodiol
### Generic Name
Ursodiol (Ursodeoxycholic Acid - UDCA)

### Usage

Ursodiol is primarily used to dissolve cholesterol gallstones.  It's particularly effective for small, radiolucent gallstones in patients who are not suitable candidates for surgery.  The medication works best when gallstones are predominantly cholesterol and the gallbladder can still function.  Ursodiol is not effective for pigment stones (those containing bilirubin) or stones that are large or calcified.

Beyond gallstones, Ursodiol is also used to treat primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a chronic liver disease.  In PBC, Ursodiol helps slow the progression of the disease, improve liver function, and reduce symptoms like itching (pruritus).  It's also used off-label in several other conditions, including preventing gallstone formation after bariatric surgery, and managing certain types of cholestasis (reduced bile flow) in infants and children.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's age and weight.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage regimen exactly as directed by a healthcare provider.

**Adults:**

* **Gallstone dissolution:** Typically 8-10 mg/kg/day, divided into 2-3 doses.  The treatment duration may extend to 24 months, but longer-term safety is not fully established.
* **Gallstone prevention (post-bariatric surgery):** 500-600 mg daily, or divided into two doses, for six months.
* **Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC):** Usually 13-15 mg/kg/day, divided into 2-4 doses taken with food.

**Children:** Dosages for children are typically calculated based on weight (mg/kg/day) and vary depending on the specific condition.  Always follow the healthcare provider's instructions precisely. Examples include:

* **Biliary atresia (after Kasai procedure):** 10-20 mg/kg/day, divided into 2-3 doses.
* **Pruritus (itching) due to cholestasis:** 15-20 mg/kg/day, once daily or in two divided doses.
* **Cystic fibrosis-related liver disease:** 20 mg/kg/day, in two divided doses.  However, the dosage range can be 10-30 mg/kg/day, adjusted according to individual response.


Ursodiol is typically administered orally in capsule or tablet form, although liquid preparations might be available for children.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Back pain
* Upper respiratory tract infections


Less common, but potentially more serious, side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Liver enzyme abnormalities
* Increased serum creatinine levels (kidney function indicator)
* Cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)


If you experience any concerning side effects, immediately contact your healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Ursodiol is a bile acid that increases the proportion of hydrophilic (water-loving) bile acids in the bile.  This helps to reduce the concentration of hydrophobic (water-fearing) bile acids that can contribute to gallstone formation and liver damage. In PBC, it protects liver cells from the damaging effects of bile acids, reduces inflammation, and improves bile flow.  The exact mechanisms are complex and involve multiple pathways, including:


* Replacing toxic bile acids
* Protecting bile duct cells
* Preventing liver cell death
* Modulating the immune response
* Stimulating bile secretion.



### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ursodiol is contraindicated in patients with gallstones that are calcified, radiopaque, or pigment stones; those with acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, biliary obstruction, gallstone pancreatitis, or biliary-gastrointestinal fistula; complete extrahepatic biliary obstruction; widespread intrahepatic obstruction; or hypersensitivity to Ursodiol or bile acids.
* **Interactions:**  Ursodiol can interact with certain medications, including cholesterol-lowering drugs (bile acid sequestrants, fibric acid derivatives), and some calcium channel blockers.  Always inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ursodiol is categorized as pregnancy category B (animal studies have shown no risk, but human studies are lacking).  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown.  Consult a healthcare provider regarding its use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Liver Disease:**  Use caution in patients with chronic liver disease, as liver function should be closely monitored.
* **Gallbladder Visualization:** Use with caution in patients with a non-visualized gallbladder.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Ursodiol to dissolve gallstones?** A:  The time varies significantly depending on the size and composition of the stones, but it can take several months or even a year or more. Regular monitoring is essential.

* **Q: Can I take Ursodiol with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you're using.  Some drugs can interact with Ursodiol, potentially affecting its efficacy or causing side effects.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store Ursodiol?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q:  Is Ursodiol a cure for PBC?** A: No, Ursodiol does not cure PBC, but it can help slow its progression, improve liver function, and manage symptoms.  Regular medical follow-up is crucial.
