# Umeclidinium + Vilanterol
### Generic Name
Umeclidinium + Vilanterol

### Usage

Umeclidinium and Vilanterol is a combination medication used for the long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  This includes conditions like chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is *not* intended for the immediate relief of acute COPD symptoms or for sudden worsening of the condition.  It works to improve lung function over time, making breathing easier.  It is not indicated for use in asthma.


### Dosage

**Adults (COPD):** The usual dose is one inhalation of Umeclidinium 62.5 mcg/Vilanterol 25 mcg once daily via a dry powder inhaler. Do not exceed one inhalation per day.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Umeclidinium + Vilanterol in children have not been established.  This medication should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are generally needed for patients with mild to moderate liver impairment.  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for those with severe liver impairment.  No adjustment is necessary for patients with kidney (renal) impairment.

### How it Works

Umeclidinium is an anticholinergic. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a chemical messenger that causes the airways to constrict.  By blocking acetylcholine, Umeclidinium helps to relax and widen the airways, making breathing easier.

Vilanterol is a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA). It works by activating beta-2 receptors in the lungs, causing the muscles surrounding the airways to relax and leading to bronchodilation (widening of the airways).  The combination of these two mechanisms provides a more comprehensive approach to managing airflow obstruction in COPD.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Umeclidinium + Vilanterol is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Umeclidinium, Vilanterol, or any component of the formulation; those with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins; and in the monotherapy treatment of asthma.

* **Warnings:**  Using this medication alone (without an inhaled corticosteroid) to treat asthma increases the risk of asthma-related deaths. There's an increased risk of paradoxical bronchospasm, serious adverse events (including fatalities), cardiovascular effects, hypokalemia (low potassium), hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), and hypersensitivity reactions.

* **Cautions:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, narrow-angle glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, hypokalemia, seizure disorders, or urinary retention.  Discuss the use of this medication with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  The effects on a developing fetus or nursing infant are not fully known.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Consult your physician about any other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible.


### FAQs
