# Univestin
### Generic Name
Univestin

### Usage
Univestin is a natural composition derived from *Scutellaria baicalensis* and *Acacia catechu*.  Its primary use is to alleviate joint discomfort, reduce stiffness, and improve mobility in individuals experiencing pain, stiffness, or discomfort in their joints.  It's designed to address the symptoms associated with joint conditions, but it does not treat the underlying cause of the condition.

### Dosage
**Adults:** For pain and inflammation of joints, the oral dosage is 1 or 2 tablets (500 mg each) daily.

**Children:** Univestin is not recommended for use in children.

**Administration:** Tablets should be swallowed whole with water; do not crush, chew, or break them.  The medication may be taken with or without food. For consistent effectiveness, take Univestin at the same time each day.  If a dose is missed, simply skip it and resume the regular schedule; do not double the dose.

### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Dark urine
* Indigestion

While less common, more serious side effects are possible.  Consult a healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.

### How it Works
Univestin's mechanism of action involves inhibiting enzymes responsible for inflammation within the body. By reducing inflammation, it helps alleviate joint discomfort and stiffness, ultimately contributing to improved joint mobility and physical function.

### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Univestin is not recommended for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding unless specifically directed by a healthcare professional.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While specific interactions are not listed, it's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking before starting Univestin.  This helps to prevent potential interactions.
* **Other Precautions:**  Univestin is a complementary therapy and should not be considered a replacement for medical advice or treatment.  If your symptoms worsen or persist despite using Univestin, it is important to seek professional medical attention.
