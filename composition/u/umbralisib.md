# Umbralisib
### Generic Name
Umbralisib

### Usage
Umbralisib is a targeted therapy used to treat specific types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in adults.  Its primary use is for patients with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have already received at least one prior treatment containing an anti-CD20 antibody.  It's also indicated for patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least three prior systemic therapies.  In essence, Umbralisib is a treatment option for patients whose lymphoma has not responded well to other treatments or has returned after previous treatments.

### Dosage
The standard adult dosage of Umbralisib is 800 mg once daily (OD) orally, continuing until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  There is no specific pediatric dosage as safety and effectiveness haven't been established in children.

Dosage adjustments are necessary based on several factors:

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For mild impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST level), no adjustment is needed.  Moderate or severe impairment requires consultation with a healthcare provider; the manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage recommendations in these cases. If hepatotoxicity (liver damage) occurs during treatment, dose reduction or discontinuation may be necessary depending on the severity of liver enzyme elevation.

* **Renal Impairment:** If creatinine clearance (CrCl) is ≥30 mL/min, no adjustment is needed.  For CrCl <30 mL/min, the manufacturer's labeling does not offer specific dosage adjustments.  A healthcare provider should be consulted.

* **Toxicity Management:** Dose reductions to 600 mg OD or 400 mg OD may be necessary based on the type and severity of side effects.  Discontinuation may be required if the patient cannot tolerate even the lowest dose. Specific guidelines for dose adjustments depending on hematologic (blood cell) or non-hematologic toxicities are provided by the prescribing healthcare professional.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Fatigue
* Insomnia
* Edema (swelling)
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Skin rash
* Decreased serum potassium
* Abdominal pain
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Decreased hemoglobin
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Increased serum ALT and AST levels (liver enzymes)
* Musculoskeletal pain
* Increased serum creatinine levels

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Serious infections (including opportunistic infections like *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia)
* Severe diarrhea or colitis (inflammation of the colon)
* Severe hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Severe cutaneous reactions (skin reactions), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

**It is crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately if any adverse effects occur.**

### How it Works
Umbralisib is a dual kinase inhibitor. It works by blocking the activity of two enzymes: phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) and casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1ε). These enzymes play a role in the growth and survival of certain cancer cells, including those in B-cell lymphomas. By inhibiting these enzymes, Umbralisib interferes with the cancer cells' ability to proliferate, adhere to other cells, and migrate, ultimately helping to control lymphoma growth.

### Precautions
* **Pregnancy:** Umbralisib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for one month afterward.
* **Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown if Umbralisib is excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for one month after the last dose.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Umbralisib may interact with other medications.  It's essential to inform the healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Umbralisib contains tartrazine, a yellow dye that can cause allergic reactions in some individuals, particularly those with aspirin hypersensitivity.
* **Infections:**  Umbralisib can increase the risk of infections.  Patients should report any signs of infection promptly. Prophylaxis for *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PJP) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is often recommended.
* **Liver and Kidney Function:**  Liver and kidney function should be monitored regularly during treatment.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Umbralisib?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while taking Umbralisib, as it could increase the risk of side effects, particularly liver damage.  Discuss alcohol consumption with your healthcare provider.

* **Q: How should I store Umbralisib?** A: Store Umbralisib at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose unless it's almost time for the next scheduled dose.  Never take a double dose.

* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects of Umbralisib?** A: The long-term effects of Umbralisib are still being studied. Regular monitoring is important to detect and manage potential side effects.

* **Q: Can I drive while taking Umbralisib?** A:  Fatigue and other side effects may impair driving ability.  Follow your healthcare provider's advice on driving while taking this medication.
