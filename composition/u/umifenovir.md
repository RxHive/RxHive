# Umifenovir
### Generic Name
Umifenovir

### Usage
Umifenovir is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat infections caused by influenza viruses A and B.  It's also employed in the management of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections and other severe acute respiratory syndromes.  While its primary use focuses on influenza and RSV, its application in broader respiratory tract infections is also documented.  The effectiveness of Umifenovir is generally considered higher when treatment begins within the first 48 hours of symptom onset, especially in confirmed or strongly suspected influenza cases.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Influenza A & B, RSV infections (Prophylaxis):** 200 mg orally once daily for 10-14 days.
* **Influenza A & B, RSV infections (Treatment, uncomplicated):** 200 mg orally four times daily (every 6 hours) for 5 days.
* **Influenza A & B, RSV infections (Treatment, complicated with bronchitis or pneumonia):** 200 mg orally four times daily (every 6 hours) for 5 days, followed by 200 mg once a week for 4 weeks.

**Children:**

*  The dosage for children older than 12 years of age is the same as the adult dosage.  Information regarding the use of Umifenovir in children younger than 12 years old is not provided in readily available information.  Always follow the advice of a healthcare professional for pediatric dosing.

### Side Effects

* Allergic reactions (frequency not specified)

Serious side effects are less common but may include severe allergic reactions.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or concerning adverse effects.


### How it Works

Umifenovir's antiviral action involves inhibiting membrane fusion.  This prevents the influenza virus (or RSV) from effectively binding to and entering the host cells, thereby hindering its ability to replicate and cause infection. In addition, it is thought to stimulate the body's humoral immune response.
