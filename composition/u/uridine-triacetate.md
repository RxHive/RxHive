# Uridine Triacetate
### Generic Name
Uridine Triacetate

### Usage
Uridine triacetate serves two primary therapeutic purposes:

1. **Treatment of Fluorouracil (5-FU) or Capecitabine Overdose/Toxicity:** This is its most crucial application.  Uridine triacetate is used as an antidote in cases of acute overdose or the development of early-onset, severe, or life-threatening toxicity from 5-FU or capecitabine.  This includes toxicity affecting the heart, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, or bone marrow (manifesting as neutropenia).  Treatment should ideally begin within 96 hours of the last 5-FU or capecitabine dose.

2. **Treatment of Hereditary Orotic Aciduria:** This is a rare inherited metabolic disorder. Uridine triacetate provides uridine, a crucial molecule the body lacks in this condition, to help the body synthesize pyrimidines necessary for normal cell function and development.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  The following dosage information is for guidance only and should not replace professional medical advice. Always consult a healthcare provider for accurate dosing and administration instructions.  Dosage may need to be adjusted based on individual patient response and clinical judgment.

**Fluorouracil/Capecitabine Toxicity (Adults and Children):**

* **Adults:** 10 grams (one packet) orally every 6 hours for a total of 20 doses.  Treatment should begin as soon as possible after overdose or the onset of severe toxicity, ideally within 96 hours of the last 5-FU or capecitabine dose.

* **Children and Adolescents:** 6.2 g/m² (maximum dose: 10 g/dose) orally every 6 hours for 20 doses. The body surface area (BSA) should be calculated to determine the appropriate dose.  The maximum single dose is 10g.  Treatment should begin as soon as possible after overdose or the onset of severe toxicity, ideally within 96 hours of the last 5-FU or capecitabine dose.

**Hereditary Orotic Aciduria:**

* **Adults and Children:** The initial oral dose is 60 mg/kg once daily. This can be increased to 120 mg/kg once daily (not to exceed 8 g total daily dose) if the initial dose proves insufficient.  Detailed weight-based dosing tables are provided in the product information.  Always consult with a prescribing physician for individualized dose selection based on the patient's response.

**Administration:**  Uridine triacetate granules should be mixed with a small amount of soft food (e.g., applesauce, pudding, yogurt) or milk/formula (for infants receiving up to ¾ teaspoon) and ingested within 30 minutes. Do not chew the granules. Drink at least 4 ounces of water.  If vomiting occurs within two hours of taking a dose, repeat the entire dose. For patients unable to take oral medication, administration via nasogastric or gastrostomy tube is possible.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (1-10%):

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea

Less common but potentially serious side effects may also occur.  It is vital to report any unusual or concerning symptoms to a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

In **fluorouracil/capecitabine toxicity**, uridine triacetate is deacetylated to uridine.  Uridine competes with fluorouridine triphosphate (a toxic metabolite of 5-FU) for incorporation into RNA. By reducing the incorporation of the toxic metabolite, uridine triacetate helps protect normal cells, thus mitigating the side effects of 5-FU or capecitabine overdose.

In **hereditary orotic aciduria**, uridine triacetate acts as a uridine replacement. The body cannot synthesize sufficient uridine in this condition, so providing it directly helps the body produce pyrimidine nucleotides, correcting the metabolic defect.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of uridine triacetate during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult a healthcare professional to weigh the benefits and risks.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments for liver or kidney disease are not currently specified in product information.
* **Drug Interactions:** No significant interactions are currently documented, but it is still prudent to inform healthcare providers about all medications being taken.
* **General Precautions:** Always follow the prescribed dosage and administration instructions carefully.  Monitor for any signs of adverse effects and consult a healthcare provider if needed.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take uridine triacetate with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking to assess potential interactions.

* **Q: How should I store uridine triacetate?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is uridine triacetate safe for long-term use?** A:  The safety of long-term use varies depending on the indication. Always follow your doctor's recommendations.

* **Q: What are the signs of an overdose?** A:  Overdose symptoms are not specifically defined in the product information but may include an exacerbation of the side effects listed. Contact your healthcare provider immediately if an overdose is suspected.
