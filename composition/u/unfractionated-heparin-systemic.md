# Unfractionated Heparin (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Unfractionated Heparin (Systemic)

### Usage
Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) is a blood thinner (anticoagulant) primarily used to prevent and treat blood clots.  Its main applications include:

* **Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT):** DVT is a blood clot that forms in a deep vein, usually in the leg. UFH helps prevent the clot from growing larger and traveling to the lungs.
* **Treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE):** A PE is a blood clot that travels to the lungs, blocking blood flow. UFH is crucial in treating PE and preventing further clots.
* **Treatment of unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI):**  UFH is used to prevent further clot formation in patients experiencing chest pain suggestive of a heart attack that isn't immediately life-threatening.
* **Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE):** This is the prevention of blood clots, particularly in high-risk patients undergoing surgery or with conditions that increase their risk of clotting.  This may be used in post-operative situations to prevent DVT or PE.
* **Treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC):** This is a rare condition where the blood clots throughout the body, consuming clotting factors and leading to both clotting and bleeding. UFH plays a role in its management.


While UFH's primary use is in treating and preventing thrombotic events (blood clots), its application in specific conditions might vary based on the patient's overall health and other factors.  Always consult a physician for appropriate use and dosage.


### Dosage

Dosage of unfractionated heparin is highly individualized and depends on several factors including the patient's weight, the severity of the condition, and the patient's response to the medication. It's crucial to note that **dosage should only be determined and adjusted by a healthcare professional.** There's no one-size-fits-all approach.

Unfractionated heparin is typically administered intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (under the skin).  Dosage is often expressed in units rather than milligrams.

* **IV administration:**  Initial doses and subsequent adjustments are determined based on blood tests (activated partial thromboplastin time or aPTT) to ensure that the blood is sufficiently thinned without excessive bleeding.  The aPTT is monitored regularly during IV heparin therapy.
* **Subcutaneous administration:** Dosage and frequency vary based on the condition being treated and the patient's response.  This method is commonly used for prophylaxis (prevention).

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Pediatric dosing requires careful consideration of weight and condition.  A physician will determine the appropriate dosage based on individual factors. There are specific pediatric dosing charts and guidelines used by healthcare professionals.

**Note:**  Never adjust the dosage of unfractionated heparin on your own.  Always follow the doctor's instructions meticulously.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Bleeding (minor to severe) â€“ this is a major risk associated with all anticoagulants.
* Bruising
* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)
* Mild fever
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count, a serious side effect, though uncommon)  This can manifest as an increase in bleeding and bruising.
* Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a rare but serious complication that can lead to serious blood clots.  This is why close monitoring is crucial.


Less Common but Serious Side Effects:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Osteoporosis (long-term use)
* Spinal or epidural hematoma (bleeding around the spinal cord)


**If you experience any unusual bleeding, bruising, severe pain, or other adverse effects, seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works

Unfractionated heparin works by binding to antithrombin III (ATIII), a naturally occurring protein in the blood. This binding enhances ATIII's ability to inhibit several clotting factors, primarily thrombin and factor Xa. By inhibiting these factors, unfractionated heparin prevents the formation and growth of blood clots.  In essence, it reduces the body's ability to form clots and can help break down existing ones.

### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Individuals with a known allergy to heparin should not use this medication.
* **Bleeding Disorders:** UFH is contraindicated in patients with active bleeding or a bleeding disorder (e.g., hemophilia).
* **Recent Surgery or Trauma:**  Increased risk of bleeding after recent surgery or trauma.
* **Liver or Kidney Disease:**  Patients with impaired liver or kidney function require close monitoring because these organs play a role in the metabolism and excretion of heparin.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy should be weighed against the risks, and careful monitoring is essential. It's often used in pregnancy to treat and prevent thrombosis, but the decision is highly individualized. Breastfeeding is generally considered safe.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Many medications can interact with unfractionated heparin, including other anticoagulants, aspirin, and NSAIDs. Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Thrombocytopenia:**  Close monitoring of platelet count is essential due to the risk of HIT.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is unfractionated heparin stored?** A:  Store unfractionated heparin as directed by the pharmacist or healthcare provider. Usually, it requires refrigeration.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration and the dose.  IV administration is faster than subcutaneous.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor immediately to determine how to proceed. Do not double the dose.
* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while on unfractionated heparin?** A:  Alcohol can increase the risk of bleeding. It is best to avoid alcohol consumption while on this medication. Consult your doctor for specific advice.
* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of unfractionated heparin?** A: Prolonged use can increase the risk of osteoporosis. Your doctor will weigh the risks and benefits of long-term therapy.
