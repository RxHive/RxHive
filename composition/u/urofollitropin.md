# Urofollitropin

**Generic Name:** Urofollitropin

**Usage:** Urofollitropin is a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) used in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) to stimulate the growth of ovarian follicles in women undergoing fertility treatment.  Specifically, it's used in:

* **Ovarian stimulation in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and other ART procedures:** This is its primary use.  It encourages multiple eggs to mature, increasing the chances of successful fertilization and pregnancy.
* **Treatment of certain types of infertility in women:**  In some cases, it may be used to stimulate ovulation in women with certain forms of anovulatory infertility (where the ovaries don't release eggs).
* **Treatment of male infertility (less common):** In men with certain types of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, it may be used to stimulate sperm production.  This is a less common application compared to its use in women.


**Side Effects:**  The side effects of urofollitropin can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS):** This is a serious complication that can range from mild to severe. Symptoms can include abdominal bloating, pain, nausea, vomiting, and in severe cases, fluid accumulation in the abdomen and chest.
* **Multiple pregnancy:**  The increased number of eggs produced increases the risk of multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.).
* **Headache:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Mood changes:**
* **Breast tenderness:**
* **Ovarian cysts:**
* **Injection site reactions:**  Redness, pain, swelling at the injection site.

**How it Works:** Urofollitropin is a recombinant human FSH.  It mimics the naturally occurring FSH hormone in the body.  FSH is crucial for the development and maturation of follicles in the ovaries.  By administering urofollitropin, doctors can stimulate the growth of multiple follicles, leading to the production of multiple eggs ready for retrieval and fertilization during IVF or other ART procedures. In men, it works similarly by stimulating the Sertoli cells in the testes to produce sperm.
