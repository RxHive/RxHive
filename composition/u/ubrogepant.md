# Ubrogepant
### Generic Name
Ubrogepant

### Usage
Ubrogepant is used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults.  It's important to understand that Ubrogepant is *not* for preventing migraines; it's designed to relieve the symptoms of a migraine *as it's happening*.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The usual starting dose is 50-100 mg taken orally as a single dose.  This dose may be repeated once after at least 2 hours, depending on how well it works and if it's tolerated. The maximum dose in a 24-hour period is 200 mg.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Ubrogepant in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Problems):**  For those with mild to moderate liver impairment, no dose adjustment is needed.  However, individuals with severe liver impairment should start with a lower dose of 50 mg and not exceed 100 mg in 24 hours.

* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Problems):**  For those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 mL/min or higher, no dose adjustment is necessary.  If CrCl is between 15-29 mL/min, start with 50 mg and do not exceed 100 mg in 24 hours.  Ubrogepant should be avoided if CrCl is less than 15 mL/min.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary when Ubrogepant is used with certain other medications.  Specifically, co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided.  Dosage adjustments are recommended with moderate and weak CYP3A4 inhibitors,  CYP3A4 inducers, and BCRP and/or P-gp inhibitors. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific guidance on dose modifications if you are taking other medications.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of users) may include:

* Drowsiness
* Nausea
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Ubrogepant works by blocking the activity of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors. CGRP is a molecule involved in the process of migraine pain. By blocking these receptors, Ubrogepant helps reduce the pain and other symptoms associated with migraine attacks.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Ubrogepant should not be used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Ubrogepant interacts with several other medications, especially those affecting the CYP3A4 enzyme system. Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your doctor or pharmacist before starting Ubrogepant.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Animal studies suggest potential harm to the fetus from in-utero exposure to Ubrogepant.  The safety of Ubrogepant during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your doctor to weigh the risks and benefits.

* **Increased Risk:** There's an increased risk of nausea and somnolence (sleepiness) with Ubrogepant.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Ubrogepant with food?** A: Yes, Ubrogepant can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store Ubrogepant?** A: Store Ubrogepant as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: How many migraine attacks can I treat with Ubrogepant in a month?** A: The safety of treating more than 8 migraine attacks in one month has not been established. Consult your physician.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Since Ubrogepant is for acute treatment, missing a dose isn't usually a major concern. Take the medication as soon as you remember if you're experiencing a migraine.  Do not take a double dose.
