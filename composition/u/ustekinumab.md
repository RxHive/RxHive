# Ustekinumab
### Generic Name
Ustekinumab

### Usage
Ustekinumab is a medication used to treat several moderate-to-severe inflammatory conditions.  Its primary use is in treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults and children (aged 6 and older) who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.  It's also indicated for moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in adults and adolescents (aged 12 and older).  Additionally, ustekinumab treats active psoriatic arthritis in adults, either alone or in combination with methotrexate.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Before starting ustekinumab, patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection using a tuberculin skin test.

**Adults:**

* **Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis:**  Subcutaneous (SC) injection.  Patients weighing ≤100 kg receive 45 mg at weeks 0 and 4, then every 12 weeks. Patients weighing >100 kg receive 90 mg at weeks 0 and 4, then every 12 weeks (though 45mg is also efficacious in this group, 90mg is recommended due to greater efficacy).

* **Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis:**  Intravenous (IV) infusion for induction: Patients weighing ≤55 kg receive 260 mg; 55-85 kg receive 390 mg; >85 kg receive 520 mg as a single dose.  Maintenance therapy is 90 mg SC every 8 weeks, starting 8 weeks after the IV induction dose.

* **Psoriatic arthritis:** 45 mg SC at weeks 0 and 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter. For patients with both psoriatic arthritis and moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis weighing >100 kg, 90 mg is administered at weeks 0 and 4, then every 12 weeks.  It can be used alone or with methotrexate.

**Children and Adolescents:**

* **Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (≥6 years):** SC injection. Dosage is weight-based:  <60 kg receive 0.75 mg/kg at weeks 0 and 4, then every 12 weeks; 60-100 kg receive 45 mg; >100 kg receive 90 mg, following the same schedule.

* **Moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease (≥12 years):** IV induction dose is weight-based (same as adults). Maintenance therapy is 90 mg SC every 8 weeks, starting 8 weeks after the IV induction dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are needed for hepatic or renal impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.

### How it Works

Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the p40 subunit shared by interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23). These interleukins are proteins involved in inflammation and immune responses. By binding to the p40 subunit, ustekinumab blocks the activity of IL-12 and IL-23, thereby reducing inflammation and improving symptoms of the targeted conditions.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  Ustekinumab is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to the medication or its components, and those with severe infections such as sepsis, tuberculosis, or opportunistic infections.

**Warnings and Precautions:**  There is an increased risk of malignancy, formation of neutralizing antibodies, hypersensitivity reactions, infections (including reactivation of latent infections), and non-infectious pneumonia.  Use caution in patients with a history of infections, conditions predisposing to infections, chronic/latent infections, or those receiving other immunosuppressants.  Live vaccines should not be given concurrently.  Consult a healthcare provider about the risks and benefits of using ustekinumab during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Patients with a history of malignancy or those receiving or who have received allergen immunotherapy should also be monitored carefully.


### FAQs
