It's crucial to understand that I cannot provide specific medical advice or endorse any particular supplement combination.  The combination you listed is highly complex and lacks a single "generic name."  Each ingredient has its own established properties, and their combined effect isn't well-studied scientifically.  Therefore, the following information is for educational purposes only and shouldn't be interpreted as a recommendation for use.  **Always consult a healthcare professional before taking any new supplement, especially one this complex.**

**Generic Name:**  There is no single generic name for this combination.  Each ingredient would be listed separately.

**Usage:**  This blend aims to provide a broad spectrum of antioxidants, essential fatty acids, and micronutrients.  The intended usage is likely for general health support, potentially targeting areas like cardiovascular health, immune function, and antioxidant protection. However, there's no clinical evidence to support this broad claim for this specific combination.

**Side Effects:**  The side effects depend heavily on the dosage of each ingredient and individual sensitivities.  Potential side effects could include:

* **Calcium ascorbate (Vitamin C):**  Gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea, nausea), kidney stones (in high doses).
* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):** Generally well-tolerated, but some individuals may experience upset stomach.
* **Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) & Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA):**  Fish burps, nausea, loose stools.  High doses may interact with blood thinners.
* **Lycopene & Mixed Carotene:**  Generally well-tolerated, but potential for discoloration of skin.
* **Piperine:**  Gastrointestinal upset, potential interactions with medications.
* **Selenium dioxide:**  Hair loss, nail changes, garlic breath (in high doses; toxicity is a concern).
* **Vitamin B complex:**  Generally well-tolerated, but high doses of certain B vitamins can cause nausea and other gastrointestinal issues.
* **Wheat germ oil:**  Allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to wheat.
* **Zinc sulfate monohydrate:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps (in high doses).


**How it Works:**  The proposed mechanism is based on the individual effects of each component:

* **Antioxidants (Vitamin C, CoQ10, Lycopene, Carotenoids, Selenium):**  Neutralize free radicals, protecting cells from damage.
* **Essential Fatty Acids (DHA, EPA):**  Important for brain health, heart health, and reducing inflammation.
* **Piperine:**  May enhance the absorption of other nutrients (bioavailability).
* **Vitamin B complex:**  Essential for energy production and various metabolic processes.
* **Zinc & Selenium:**  Important for immune function and various enzymatic processes.
* **Wheat germ oil:**  Source of various vitamins and fatty acids.


**FAQs:**
