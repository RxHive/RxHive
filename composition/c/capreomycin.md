# Capreomycin

**Generic Name:** Capreomycin

**Usage:**

Capreomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat serious infections caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis (TB).  It's typically used in combination with other anti-TB drugs, particularly in cases of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) or extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) where other medications have failed.  It's not a first-line treatment for TB.

**Side Effects:**

Capreomycin, like other aminoglycosides, can cause a range of side effects, some mild and some serious.  These include:

* **Common side effects:** Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling), nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache.
* **Serious side effects:**  Hearing loss (ototoxicity), kidney damage (nephrotoxicity), nerve damage (neuropathy â€“ including numbness, tingling, weakness), muscle weakness, low blood counts (affecting blood clotting and infection fighting ability).  Allergic reactions, though rare, can be severe.  These serious side effects are more likely with prolonged use or higher doses.

**How it Works:**

Capreomycin works by inhibiting protein synthesis in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. This essentially stops the bacteria from replicating and allows the body's immune system to clear the infection.  The precise mechanism involves binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of the bacterial ribosome, interfering with the process of translating messenger RNA into proteins necessary for bacterial survival.

**FAQs:**

* **Is capreomycin given orally?** No, capreomycin is administered by intramuscular (IM) injection only.
* **How long is the treatment course?** The duration of treatment depends on the severity of the infection and the patient's response to therapy. It can last for several months or even years, usually in combination with other anti-TB drugs.
* **What are the monitoring requirements?** Regular monitoring of hearing (audiograms), kidney function (blood tests), and overall health is crucial during capreomycin treatment to detect and manage potential side effects.
* **Are there drug interactions?** Yes, capreomycin can interact with other medications, including other nephrotoxic drugs (those harmful to the kidneys) and neuromuscular blocking agents.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Can I drink alcohol while on capreomycin?**  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking capreomycin, as it can worsen some side effects, particularly liver function issues (though this isn't a primary concern with capreomycin itself).  Consult your doctor.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, especially hearing loss, muscle weakness, or changes in urination.
