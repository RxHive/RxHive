# Capreomycin
### Generic Name
Capreomycin

### Usage
Capreomycin is a powerful antibiotic belonging to the aminoglycoside class.  It's primarily used as a second-line treatment for active tuberculosis (TB) that is resistant to other, more commonly used TB medications (multi-drug resistant TB or MDR-TB). This means it's typically reserved for cases where first-line drugs haven't been effective.  It's often part of a combination therapy regimen, meaning it's used alongside other anti-tuberculosis drugs to maximize effectiveness and reduce the risk of drug resistance. While primarily used for pulmonary TB, it may also be considered for extrapulmonary TB, including cases of TB meningitis, though its use in these instances is less common and requires careful consideration by a specialist.

### Dosage

Capreomycin is administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). Dosage varies greatly depending on several factors including the patient's age, weight, renal function, and the specific treatment regimen being used.  It's crucial to follow a physician's exact instructions.  

**Adults:**  Doses can range from 1 gram per day for 60-120 days initially, followed by 1 gram 2-3 times per week for an extended period (12-24 months).  Alternatively, dosages may be calculated based on body weight, such as 15 mg/kg daily or 25 mg/kg three times weekly, with a maximum daily dose of 20 mg/kg.  The duration of treatment depends on the individual's response to the medication and the severity of the infection.

**Children:** Pediatric dosages are significantly more complex and should always be determined by a physician specializing in pediatric infectious diseases. Doses are usually calculated based on weight in mg/kg, and the frequency of administration can range from once daily to multiple times per week depending on the chosen regimen.  Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) is often recommended for children.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (renal impairment). Lower doses are required to prevent the accumulation of capreomycin in the body, which can lead to toxic effects.  The dosage will be carefully adjusted based on the patient's creatinine clearance (CrCl) value. There are no specific dosage adjustments for patients with liver impairment as mentioned in the provided data.


### Side Effects

Capreomycin, like many powerful antibiotics, can cause several side effects.  Some of the more common side effects include:

* **Nephrotoxicity:** Kidney damage. This is a significant concern and necessitates regular monitoring of kidney function.
* **Ototoxicity:** Damage to the inner ear, leading to hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and balance problems.  This is another serious side effect.
* **Eosinophilia:** An increase in a type of white blood cell.

Less common, but potentially more serious, side effects include:  acute tubular necrosis, abnormal urinary sediment, hypersensitivity reactions (fever, rash, urticaria), various electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia),  liver function abnormalities, and blood cell abnormalities (leukocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia).

**If you experience any of these side effects, particularly those affecting your hearing or kidneys, it is crucial to contact your doctor immediately.**

### How it Works

Capreomycin is a cyclic polypeptide antibiotic. Its exact mechanism of action against mycobacteria (the bacteria that cause TB) isn't fully understood but it's believed to interfere with bacterial protein synthesis, thus preventing the bacteria from multiplying and causing further damage.  It's noteworthy that mycobacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics may still be susceptible to capreomycin. However, cross-resistance can occur with similar drugs like viomycin, kanamycin, and neomycin.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Capreomycin should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to capreomycin or other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
* **Kidney and Hearing Problems:**  Individuals with pre-existing kidney or hearing problems are at significantly increased risk of serious complications.  Careful monitoring is essential.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Capreomycin is categorized as a pregnancy category C drug, meaning its safety during pregnancy is not established. It should be avoided in pregnancy due to the potential for fetal harm. The excretion of capreomycin in breast milk is unknown, therefore caution is advised.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Capreomycin can interact with other medications, particularly those that are also nephrotoxic (harmful to the kidneys) or ototoxic (harmful to the ears), such as other aminoglycosides, certain diuretics, or some antifungal drugs.  It's crucial to inform your physician of all medications you're taking.  Also, capreomycin can potentiate neuromuscular-blocking drugs.
* **Alcohol:** Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol during capreomycin therapy, as it could increase the risk of certain adverse effects.



### FAQs

* **Q: How is capreomycin administered?**  A: It is administered intravenously or intramuscularly.

* **Q: How long is the treatment course?** A:  Treatment duration is variable, and depends on the individual's response to the therapy and disease severity, often lasting for many months.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately for guidance, do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should capreomycin be stored?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided with your medication.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions?** A: No specific dietary restrictions are typically associated with capreomycin treatment, but it's always advisable to maintain a healthy diet to support overall well-being during treatment.

* **Q: Is capreomycin a first-line treatment for TB?** A: No, it's a second-line treatment reserved for drug-resistant TB.
