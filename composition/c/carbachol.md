# Carbachol
### Generic Name
Carbachol

### Usage
Carbachol is primarily used to induce miosis (constriction of the pupil) during ophthalmic surgery, helping surgeons achieve a better view of the eye's interior.  It's also used to lower elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in the 24 hours following cataract surgery.  Additionally, carbachol finds application in treating urinary retention, both acute postoperative cases and chronic conditions.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration and the condition being treated.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

* **Intraocular (for miosis and IOP reduction):**  A 0.01% solution is injected, typically up to 0.5 mL into the anterior chamber of the eye.  This is usually done during surgery, either before or after sutures are placed.

* **Ophthalmic (for glaucoma):**  A 0.75% to 3% solution is administered as 1-2 drops in the affected eye three times a day (TID). It's often used in conjunction with other glaucoma medications.

* **Oral (for urinary retention):** A typical dose is 2 mg three times a day (TID).

* **Subcutaneous (for acute postoperative urinary retention):** 250 mcg is administered subcutaneously. This dose may be repeated twice at 30-minute intervals if necessary.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of carbachol in children have not been established.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Carbachol is a parasympathomimetic agent, meaning it mimics the effects of the parasympathetic nervous system.  Specifically, it's a cholinergic agonist that directly stimulates muscarinic M3 receptors in the eye. This stimulation causes contraction of the pupillary sphincter muscle (miosis) and the ciliary muscle (accommodation). The contraction of the ciliary muscle facilitates increased outflow of aqueous humor, which reduces intraocular pressure.  In the urinary tract, it stimulates the muscarinic receptors in the bladder, promoting contraction and urination.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Carbachol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to carbachol or any of its components, acute iritis, or acute inflammatory diseases of the anterior chamber.

* **Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution when using carbachol in patients with corneal abrasions, asthma, acute heart failure, peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal spasms, hyperthyroidism, Parkinson's disease, urinary tract obstruction, or those undergoing general anesthesia.

* **Drug Interactions:** Carbachol's effects can be intensified by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and beta-blockers.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Carbachol is categorized as pregnancy category C.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, so use during breastfeeding should be approached with caution.  Consult your healthcare provider.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store carbachol?** A: Store carbachol as directed on the product label.  Generally, this involves keeping it at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I drive after using carbachol eye drops?** A:  No, it's advisable to avoid driving or operating machinery after using carbachol eye drops, as blurred vision is a possible side effect.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Is carbachol addictive?** A: No, carbachol is not considered an addictive substance.

* **Q: Can I use carbachol with other eye drops?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist before combining carbachol with other eye drops to avoid potential interactions.  They can help ensure the safety and effectiveness of your treatment plan.
