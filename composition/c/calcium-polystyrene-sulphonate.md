# Calcium Polystyrene Sulphonate
### Generic Name
Calcium Polystyrene Sulphonate

### Usage
Calcium polystyrene sulfonate is a medication primarily used to treat hyperkalemia, a condition characterized by dangerously high levels of potassium in the blood.  It's a cation-exchange resin, meaning it works by binding potassium ions in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream and promoting their elimination through the stool.  While its primary use is in hyperkalemia management, it may also be used in conjunction with other treatments for managing potassium levels in patients with kidney disease or heart failure, conditions which often lead to elevated potassium.  It's crucial to understand that this medication does *not* lower potassium levels already present in the body; it works by preventing further potassium absorption.

### Dosage
Dosage of calcium polystyrene sulfonate is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the severity of hyperkalemia, the patient's age, renal function, and overall health. It's administered orally, typically as a powder or granules mixed with water or other fluids.  Specific dosages are determined by a physician based on the individual's potassium levels and response to treatment.  There is no standard IV formulation of calcium polystyrene sulfonate; it is always administered orally.  Dosage for children is also determined by a physician on a case-by-case basis and is dependent on factors such as weight and serum potassium levels.  It is vital to follow the instructions prescribed by your doctor precisely.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of calcium polystyrene sulfonate can include:

* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Hypokalemia (in rare cases, if excessive potassium is removed)
* Aluminum toxicity (if the patient has kidney problems; aluminum may be a contaminant in some formulations)
* Hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels, especially in patients with impaired kidney function)


Less common but serious side effects include bowel obstruction or necrosis (tissue death) in the bowel, particularly with prolonged use or in patients with pre-existing bowel conditions.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, or signs of bowel obstruction.


### How it Works
Calcium polystyrene sulfonate works by exchanging calcium ions for potassium ions in the gastrointestinal tract.  This means it binds potassium in the gut, preventing its absorption into the bloodstream. The bound potassium is then eliminated from the body through the feces.  Essentially, it acts as a "sponge" to soak up excess potassium, preventing it from entering the circulatory system and potentially causing dangerous heart rhythm problems.

### Precautions
Several important precautions need to be considered before using calcium polystyrene sulfonate:

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in patients with bowel obstructions or significant gastrointestinal problems.  It should be used cautiously in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Calcium polystyrene sulfonate can interact with other medications, including digoxin and other drugs that affect potassium levels.  It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.
* **Specific Populations:**  Special care must be taken when using this medication in pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and elderly individuals, as well as patients with impaired kidney or bowel function.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Monitoring:** Regular blood tests to monitor potassium and calcium levels are crucial during treatment with calcium polystyrene sulfonate.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies but generally, improvements in potassium levels are seen within a few hours to days, depending on dosage and severity of hyperkalemia.

* **Q: Can I take it with other medications?** A: It's crucial to discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your doctor before taking calcium polystyrene sulfonate, to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store the medication as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you miss a dose.  Do not double the dose to compensate for a missed dose.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects?** A: Long-term use carries an increased risk of constipation and potential electrolyte imbalances.  Regular monitoring by your physician is crucial.
