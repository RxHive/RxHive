# Calcium Polystyrene Sulphonate

**Generic Name:** Calcium Polystyrene Sulfonate

**Usage:**

Calcium polystyrene sulfonate is a medication used to treat **hyperkalemia**, which is a condition characterized by high levels of potassium in the blood.  It's primarily used in patients with kidney disease or those who have experienced a sudden surge in potassium levels. It's administered orally (usually as a powder mixed with water or juice) or rectally (as an enema).  It is *not* a first-line treatment for hyperkalemia and is usually used alongside other treatments aimed at addressing the underlying cause of the high potassium.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Constipation:** This is a very frequent side effect, sometimes severe.
* **Hypokalemia (low potassium):** Paradoxical lowering of potassium can occur, particularly with overuse.
* **Hypocalcemia (low calcium):**  Though less frequent than constipation, this can also be a problem.
* **Metabolic alkalosis:**  A disturbance in the body's acid-base balance.
* **Dehydration:** Due to fluid loss from the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Less common but possible side effects.
* **Rectal irritation (with rectal administration):** Can be painful and uncomfortable.

**Rare but serious side effects include:**

* **Intestinal necrosis:**  Death of intestinal tissue, a very serious complication.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:** More severe disturbances in potassium, calcium, or other electrolytes.


**How it Works:**

Calcium polystyrene sulfonate is a **cation-exchange resin**.  This means it works by binding to potassium ions (K+) in the gastrointestinal tract.  The potassium is then eliminated from the body through the feces.  The resin exchanges calcium ions (Ca2+) for potassium ions, hence the name "calcium" polystyrene sulfonate. This exchange helps lower the potassium level in the blood.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is calcium polystyrene sulfonate a fast-acting treatment for hyperkalemia?** A: No, it's not.  It works more slowly than intravenous treatments for hyperkalemia and is generally used to manage chronic or less severe cases or as a supplementary treatment alongside other methods.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effect on potassium levels is usually seen within several hours to a few days, depending on the severity of hyperkalemia and the dosage.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience constipation?** A:  Drink plenty of fluids and increase your fiber intake.  If constipation persists or is severe, consult your doctor.

* **Q: Can I take calcium polystyrene sulfonate with other medications?** A:  It can interact with certain medications. Always inform your doctor and pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking calcium polystyrene sulfonate?** A:  Your doctor may advise dietary changes to manage potassium intake.  This might include limiting foods high in potassium.

* **Q:  Is this medication suitable for long-term use?** A:  It's generally not intended for long-term use due to the risk of side effects like constipation and electrolyte imbalances.
