**Generic Name:** Clobetasol Propionate + Fusidic Acid + Miconazole Nitrate

**Usage:** This triple combination cream or ointment is a topical corticosteroid (Clobetasol Propionate), an antibiotic (Fusidic Acid), and an antifungal (Miconazole Nitrate).

* **Infected dermatoses:** Other skin conditions that are infected, such as psoriasis, or tinea infections complicated by bacterial infection.

**Important Note:** This medication is typically used for *short-term* treatment of severe skin infections under strict medical supervision.  Prolonged use is generally discouraged due to potential side effects.  It should only be used as prescribed by a doctor.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the length of treatment. Common side effects include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, redness.
* **Thinning of the skin (skin atrophy):** Particularly with prolonged use.
