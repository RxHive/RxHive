# Citalopram

**Generic Name:** Citalopram

**Usage:** Citalopram is used to treat depression and some anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and social anxiety disorder.  It's a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant.  The specific dose and duration of treatment will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and response.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency from person to person. Common side effects include:

* **Nausea:** Often occurs early in treatment and usually subsides.
* **Headache:** Can be mild to moderate.
* **Insomnia or sleep disturbances:** Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.
* **Drowsiness or fatigue:** Feeling tired or sluggish.
* **Dry mouth:**  Reduced saliva production.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty with bowel movements.
* **Sweating:** Increased perspiration.
* **Sexual dysfunction:** Decreased libido, difficulty achieving orgasm, erectile dysfunction.
* **Weight changes:** Weight gain or loss.

**Less common but more serious side effects require immediate medical attention and include:**

* **Serotonin syndrome:** A potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, confusion, rapid heart rate, and other symptoms.
* **Mania or hypomania:**  Periods of abnormally elevated mood, energy, and activity.
* **Suicidal thoughts or behaviors:** Although rare, this is a potential risk, particularly in younger adults.  Increased monitoring is necessary in this population.
* **Bleeding problems:**  Increased risk of bleeding or bruising.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:** Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).  It works by increasing the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain.  Serotonin plays a crucial role in regulating mood, sleep, and other functions.  By blocking the reuptake of serotonin, citalopram helps to increase the amount of serotonin available in the synapses (the spaces between nerve cells), leading to improved mood and reduced anxiety symptoms. The exact mechanism by which it relieves symptoms of depression and anxiety is not fully understood, but the increase in serotonin is believed to be a key factor.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?**  It usually takes several weeks for citalopram to start working effectively.  You may not notice a significant improvement in your symptoms immediately.
* **Can I stop taking it suddenly?** No.  Stopping citalopram suddenly can lead to withdrawal symptoms, such as dizziness, nausea, headache, and anxiety.  You should always talk to your doctor before stopping the medication.  They will help you gradually reduce your dose to minimize withdrawal effects.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking citalopram?** It's generally advised to limit or avoid alcohol consumption while taking citalopram, as alcohol can interact with the medication and worsen side effects.  Consult your doctor for guidance.
* **Can I take citalopram with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting citalopram.  Some medications can interact with citalopram, potentially leading to adverse effects.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.
* **What are the long-term effects of taking citalopram?** Long-term effects vary depending on the individual. Some people may experience long-term benefits from continued treatment, while others may be able to discontinue the medication after a certain period.  Regular monitoring by a doctor is crucial.
