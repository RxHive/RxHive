# Citalopram
### Generic Name
Citalopram

### Usage
Citalopram is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), a common mood disorder characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest, and other symptoms.  It's a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), meaning it works by increasing the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain that plays a crucial role in mood regulation. While primarily indicated for depression, citalopram is also sometimes used off-label for other conditions, including: generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and certain types of binge eating disorder.  The effectiveness of citalopram in these off-label uses varies, and should be discussed with a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical starting dose for depression is 20mg once daily, either in the morning or evening.  The dose may be gradually increased by the physician, in increments of at least one week apart, to a maximum of 40mg daily.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with hepatic impairment or those who are poor metabolizers of the drug. Older adults (over 60) typically require lower doses, often not exceeding 20mg daily, due to increased sensitivity.  The dosage for other conditions mentioned above (off-label uses) varies and is determined by the healthcare provider based on individual needs and response to treatment.


**Children:**  Citalopram is not approved for use in children.  Off-label use in children and adolescents is only considered under very specific circumstances and strict medical supervision due to increased risks of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in this population. Any off-label use in pediatric patients must be carefully managed by a specialist.  


**Forms:** Citalopram is typically available as oral tablets.


**Administration:** Citalopram tablets should be swallowed whole with water. It can generally be taken with or without food.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Nausea
* Dry mouth
* Sweating (diaphoresis)
* Sleep disturbances (insomnia or drowsiness)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* QT prolongation (abnormality in the heart's electrical activity, potentially leading to serious arrhythmias): particularly important in patients with existing heart conditions or those taking other medications that prolong the QT interval.
* Serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status)
* Bleeding events (increased risk of bruising or bleeding)
* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels in the blood)
* Suicidal thoughts or behaviors (particularly in younger patients)


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).  Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood, sleep, and other functions.  Citalopram works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin in the brain. This means that more serotonin remains available in the synapses (the spaces between nerve cells), enhancing its effects and helping to improve mood and alleviate symptoms of depression and other related conditions.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Citalopram is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, those currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and those with known QT prolongation or congenital long QT syndrome.  It should be used cautiously in individuals with liver or kidney impairment, a history of seizures, or those receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).


* **Drug Interactions:**  Citalopram can interact with several other medications, including MAOIs, certain anticoagulants, and drugs that prolong the QT interval. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting citalopram.


* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Citalopram is categorized as a pregnancy Category C drug, meaning its effects on pregnancy are not fully known.  It can pass into breast milk. The potential risks and benefits should be carefully weighed by a healthcare professional before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.


* **Geriatric Patients:** Older adults may be more sensitive to citalopram's side effects and may require lower doses.


* **Withdrawal:** Abruptly stopping citalopram can cause withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before discontinuing the medication, who will help to taper the dosage gradually.


* **Suicidal Ideation:** There is an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, particularly in young adults, when taking antidepressants.  Close monitoring is crucial, especially at the beginning of treatment and with any dose changes.  


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for citalopram to work?** A:  It can take several weeks to notice a significant improvement in symptoms.  Continue taking the medication as prescribed, even if you don't see immediate results.  Consult your doctor if you have concerns.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking citalopram?** A: It's best to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking citalopram as alcohol can worsen side effects and interact with the medication.

* **Q: Can I stop taking citalopram suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping citalopram can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before discontinuing the medication. They will help to taper your dose gradually to minimize withdrawal effects.
