# Calcium Polycarbophil
### Generic Name
Calcium Polycarbophil

### Usage
Calcium polycarbophil is primarily used to treat constipation. It works as a bulk-forming laxative, meaning it adds bulk to the stool, making it easier to pass.  This makes it useful in relieving occasional constipation and helping to regulate bowel movements.  While not its primary use, it may also be used to help manage diarrhea in some cases by absorbing excess water in the stool.

### Dosage
**Adults:** For constipation, the usual dose is 625 mg taken 1 to 4 times daily by mouth.

**Children:**  For children aged 6-12 years, the dose is also 625 mg 1 to 4 times daily. Children 12 years and older can take the adult dose.  Always follow a healthcare provider's instructions for children's dosage, as it may vary based on individual needs.

**Dosage Forms:** Calcium polycarbophil is typically available as tablets or caplets.  It's crucial to take it with plenty of water or other fluids, as it absorbs liquid and expands in the gut.  Failure to do so can lead to esophageal obstruction.

### Side Effects
* **Common:** The most common side effect is mild stomach discomfort such as epigastric fullness (feeling full in the upper stomach) and flatulence (gas).
* **Serious (Less Common):**  While rare, there is a risk of esophageal obstruction (blockage) if the medication is not taken with sufficient fluid. Symptoms may include chest pain, difficulty swallowing, or difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.


### How it Works
Calcium polycarbophil is a bulk-forming laxative.  When ingested and mixed with water in the digestive tract, it swells and forms a soft, bulky mass. This increased bulk stimulates bowel movements and helps soften the stool, making it easier to eliminate.  It does not directly stimulate bowel contractions like stimulant laxatives.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Calcium polycarbophil should not be used by individuals who have a known hypersensitivity or allergy to it or any of its components.
* **Interactions:**  While generally well-tolerated, it's advisable to take calcium polycarbophil at least two hours before or after taking other medications. This helps to prevent potential interactions or absorption issues.
* **Specific Populations:**  Pregnant women can use it for occasional constipation but should consult their doctor.  The safety of use during breastfeeding is unclear; caution is advised.  Those with difficulty swallowing should avoid this medication due to the risk of esophageal blockage.  Patients with known rectal bleeding or failure should also use it with caution under medical supervision.
* **General Precautions:** Always drink plenty of fluids when taking this medication.  Taking calcium polycarbophil without enough liquid can lead to serious complications, such as esophageal blockage. Do not exceed the recommended dosage. Prolonged use (more than one week) should be discussed with a doctor.


### FAQs
