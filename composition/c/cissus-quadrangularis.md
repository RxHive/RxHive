# Cissus Quadrangularis
### Generic Name
Cissus Quadrangularis

### Usage
Cissus quadrangularis, also known as veldt grape, adamant creeper, or devil's backbone, is a plant primarily used to improve joint and bone health.  While traditionally used for various purposes, current scientific evidence primarily supports its role in addressing joint pain and potentially promoting bone healing.  More research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and mechanisms of action in other purported uses.

### Dosage
Dosage recommendations for Cissus quadrangularis vary, and safety and efficacy haven't been fully established.  The following dosages are based on expert recommendations and should not be considered definitive:

* **Adults:** For improving joint and bone health, oral administration of up to 3 grams per day in capsule or powder form is suggested.
* **Children:**  Oral administration of up to 1.5 grams per day of the powder form is suggested for improving joint and bone health.  However, using Cissus quadrangularis in children requires careful consideration and should only be done under the strict guidance of a healthcare professional.

**Important Note:**  These dosages are based on available information and expert opinions; however, standardized dosing guidelines are lacking.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using Cissus quadrangularis, especially for children.  The dosage form (capsule, powder) might influence absorption and efficacy.

### Side Effects
The following side effects have been reported, although their frequency isn't well-defined:

* Diarrhea
* Dry mouth
* Headaches
* Insomnia

While rare, more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and seek medical advice immediately.

### How it Works
The exact mechanism of action of Cissus quadrangularis isn't fully understood but is thought to involve its anti-inflammatory and cartilage-regenerative properties.  It's believed to work by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). MMPs are enzymes that break down cartilage, while ROS are molecules that contribute to inflammation and tissue damage. By inhibiting these, Cissus quadrangularis may help reduce inflammation and promote cartilage repair, potentially alleviating joint pain and supporting bone health.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Cissus quadrangularis is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or similar compounds.
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), particularly in diabetic patients.  Careful monitoring of blood sugar levels is crucial for those with diabetes who consider using this supplement.
* **Use with Caution:**  It should be used cautiously in individuals with diabetes.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid Cissus quadrangularis as its safety and efficacy in these populations haven't been established.
