# Calcium Polystyrene Sulfonate
### Generic Name
Calcium Polystyrene Sulfonate

### Usage
Calcium polystyrene sulfonate is a medication primarily used to treat high potassium levels in the blood (hyperkalemia) in patients with kidney failure or those producing very little urine (anuria or severe oliguria).  It's crucial to understand that this medication doesn't treat the underlying cause of hyperkalemia; it only addresses the dangerously high potassium levels.  This is a life-saving treatment for hyperkalemia in individuals with severely impaired kidney function.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Hyperkalemia):**

* **Oral:** 15 grams 3-4 times daily.  Treatment should be initiated if potassium levels are above 6 mmol/L (6 mEq/L) and discontinued once potassium levels reach 5 mmol/L (5 mEq/L) or below.
* **Rectal:** 30 grams once daily.  Again, monitor potassium levels closely and discontinue treatment appropriately.

**Pediatric Dosage (Hyperkalemia):**

Dosage is dependent on the child's weight and age, and should always be determined by a physician.  Generally:

* **Neonates (Rectal):** 0.5-1 gram/kilogram/dose.
* **Children (Oral - preferred):** Initial dose 1 gram/kilogram daily in divided doses.  Maintenance dose may be reduced to 0.5 gram/kilogram daily in divided doses.  Rectal administration may also be used at similar dosages but oral administration is generally preferred.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult with a healthcare professional for appropriate dosing in these situations.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Diarrhea
* Gastric irritation


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Bezoar formation (hard mass in the stomach or intestines, primarily with oral administration)
* Fecal impaction (primarily with rectal administration)
* Gastrointestinal (GI) necrosis (tissue death)
* GI obstruction
* GI ulceration
* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium)
* Hypomagnesemia (low blood magnesium)
* Intestinal stenosis (narrowing of the intestine)
* Ischemic colitis (lack of blood flow to the colon)
* Mesenteric ischemia (lack of blood flow to the intestines)
* Rectal hemorrhage


**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, it's essential to seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Calcium polystyrene sulfonate is a cation-exchange resin.  This means it works in the intestines by exchanging calcium ions for potassium ions.  The potassium ions are then eliminated from the body through the stool, thereby lowering the potassium level in the blood.  It's crucial to remember that it works in the gut, not directly on the kidneys.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Calcium polystyrene sulfonate should *not* be used in individuals with a known allergy to polystyrene sulfonate resins, those with serum potassium levels below 5 mmol/L (5 mEq/L), those with conditions causing hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), those with obstructive bowel disease, neonates receiving oral administration, or neonates with reduced gut motility.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients using this medication are at increased risk for electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia â€“ low potassium, hypercalcemia, hypomagnesemia) and gastrointestinal complications.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Calcium polystyrene sulfonate can interact with other medications, potentially altering their effectiveness or causing adverse effects.  Some examples include lithium, thyroid medications, aluminum hydroxide, cardiac glycosides, antacids, magnesium-containing laxatives, and meloxicam.  It's vital to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements being taken.
* **Use with Caution:**  Use with caution in individuals with renal impairment or those undergoing dialysis.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of calcium polystyrene sulfonate during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown. Consult a doctor before using this medication if pregnant or breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is calcium polystyrene sulfonate administered?** A: It can be administered orally (as a suspension or paste; via nasogastric tube if needed), or rectally (as an enema).

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effects vary depending on the dosage and route of administration.  Potassium levels should be monitored closely.

* **Q: How should I store calcium polystyrene sulfonate?** A: Store as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A:  Long-term use may lead to electrolyte imbalances or gastrointestinal problems; regular monitoring is necessary.

* **Q: Can I take calcium polystyrene sulfonate with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
