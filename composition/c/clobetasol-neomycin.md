# Clobetasol + Neomycin
### Generic Name
Clobetasol Propionate + Neomycin Sulfate

### Usage

Clobetasol Propionate + Neomycin Sulfate is a combination topical medication used to treat inflammatory skin conditions that are complicated by bacterial infection.  Clobetasol propionate is a potent corticosteroid that reduces inflammation, itching, and redness. Neomycin sulfate is an antibiotic that combats bacterial infections.  This combination is primarily used for conditions like:

* **Infected eczema (atopic dermatitis):**  When eczema flares up and becomes infected with bacteria.
* **Infected psoriasis:** Psoriasis lesions that have developed a secondary bacterial infection.
* **Infected contact dermatitis:** Inflammatory skin reactions caused by contact with an allergen or irritant, which have become infected.
* **Other inflammatory skin conditions with bacterial infection:**  This combination may be used for other similar skin conditions complicated by a bacterial infection, as determined by a physician.

It's crucial to understand that this medication treats the *symptoms* of the infection and the inflammation.  It does not address the underlying cause of the skin condition.  Therefore, it should be used only as directed by a doctor and under their ongoing supervision.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the affected area, severity of the condition, and the patient's age.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  Generally, the cream or ointment is applied thinly to the affected area one to two times daily.  

* **Adults and Children:** The application frequency and duration of treatment are determined by the healthcare provider and are dependent on the specific condition and response to treatment. It's important to use only the prescribed amount and not exceed the recommended frequency to avoid potential side effects.
* **Oral and IV administration:** This medication is for topical use only and is not available in oral or intravenous forms.

Specific instructions will be provided by your doctor or pharmacist based on your individual needs.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Skin thinning (atrophy)
* Itching
* Dryness
* Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles)

Less common but serious side effects:

* Skin discoloration
* Increased susceptibility to infections
* Stretch marks (striae)
* Acne-like eruptions
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing)
* Cushing's syndrome (rare, with prolonged use of potent corticosteroids)

**If you experience any of these side effects, especially serious ones, stop using the medication and consult your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

Clobetasol propionate works by suppressing the immune system's response in the skin, reducing inflammation, itching, and redness associated with various skin conditions.  It does this by binding to receptors inside skin cells, leading to decreased production of inflammatory substances. Neomycin sulfate, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, works by disrupting bacterial protein synthesis, thus inhibiting bacterial growth and fighting infection.  The combination targets both the inflammatory aspect and the bacterial infection of the skin condition.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used if you have a known allergy to clobetasol propionate, neomycin, or any other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Children:** Use in children should be under strict medical supervision due to the potential for increased absorption and side effects.
* **Elderly:**  Elderly patients may be more susceptible to skin thinning and other side effects.  Careful monitoring is required.
* **Extensive skin areas:** Avoid using this medication on large skin areas or for prolonged periods without a doctor's supervision.
* **Avoid covering treated areas:** Do not cover the treated area with an airtight bandage, unless specifically instructed by your doctor, as this can increase the risk of side effects.
