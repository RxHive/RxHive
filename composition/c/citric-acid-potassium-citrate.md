# Citric Acid + Potassium Citrate
### Generic Name
Citric Acid + Potassium Citrate

### Usage

Citric acid and potassium citrate combination is primarily used to treat **metabolic acidosis**.  Metabolic acidosis is a condition where the body has too much acid in its blood. This can be caused by various factors, including kidney disease, severe diarrhea, or uncontrolled diabetes.  The combination works by alkalizing the urine, helping the body to excrete excess acid.  It is also sometimes used to prevent the formation of kidney stones, particularly calcium oxalate stones, by increasing urine citrate levels and pH.  While not its primary use, it may be used to treat symptoms associated with hypokalemia (low potassium levels) in some cases, but this should always be under the direct supervision of a physician due to the potential for electrolyte imbalances.


### Dosage

Dosage of citric acid and potassium citrate varies greatly depending on the individual's condition, age, and kidney function.  It's crucial to **only take this medication as prescribed by a doctor**.  There is no standard dosage that can be provided here.  The medication comes in different forms, including oral solutions and powders for reconstitution.  Dosage is typically adjusted based on blood tests monitoring acid-base balance and potassium levels.  Children's dosage is strictly determined by a physician based on weight and medical condition.  IV administration of this combination is not typical; potassium and acid-base imbalances are generally managed differently intravenously.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

*   Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
*   Stomach pain
*   Heartburn
*   Increased thirst
*   Frequent urination


Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

*   Electrolyte imbalances (high potassium levels â€“ hyperkalemia)
*   Alkalosis (too much base in the blood)


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones,  **immediately consult your doctor**.


### How it Works

Citric acid and potassium citrate work synergistically. Citric acid helps to increase the pH (alkalinity) of urine, aiding in the excretion of excess hydrogen ions (acids).  Potassium citrate contributes potassium ions, which can help to counterbalance the effects of acidosis and address potassium deficiency, if present. By increasing urine pH and citrate concentration, it also inhibits the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones.


### Precautions

*   **Kidney disease:** This combination should be used with extreme caution in individuals with kidney disease, as impaired kidney function can hinder the body's ability to regulate electrolytes.
*   **Heart disease:** Individuals with heart conditions, particularly those with a history of heart rhythm problems, should be closely monitored while using this medication, due to the potassium content.
*   **Other medications:** This combination can interact with other medications, especially diuretics (water pills) and certain heart medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.
*   **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** The use of this medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully evaluated by a doctor, as it may affect the mother and child.
*   **Allergies:** Individuals with allergies to citric acid or potassium should avoid this medication.
