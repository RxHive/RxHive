# Chlorhexidine Gluconate + Neomycin

**Generic Name:** Chlorhexidine Gluconate + Neomycin Sulfate

**Usage:** This combination is primarily used topically to treat skin and wound infections.  Specific applications might include:

* **Treatment of infected wounds:**  Minor cuts, abrasions, burns (depending on severity), and other wounds where bacterial infection is suspected.
* **Prevention of infection:** In certain surgical procedures or after minor skin trauma.
* **Treatment of certain skin infections:**  Some formulations might be used for superficial skin infections caused by susceptible bacteria.

**Note:**  The exact usage depends on the specific formulation and should always be determined by a healthcare professional.  This is not for internal use.

**Side Effects:**  Possible side effects can include:

* **Local reactions:**  Skin irritation, redness, itching, burning, or dryness at the application site.  Allergic reactions (contact dermatitis) are possible.
* **Systemic reactions (rare):**  With extensive use or absorption through broken skin, systemic reactions such as kidney damage (neomycin toxicity) are theoretically possible, although rare.
* **Hearing loss (rare):**  Neomycin can, in rare cases, cause hearing loss, especially with prolonged or extensive use.
* **Other:**  Other side effects are possible and should be reported to a doctor.

**How it Works:**

* **Chlorhexidine Gluconate:** This is a broad-spectrum antiseptic that works by disrupting bacterial cell membranes, leading to cell death. It is effective against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as some fungi.

* **Neomycin Sulfate:** This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis, ultimately killing bacteria.  It is effective against a range of Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.

The combination provides broader antimicrobial coverage than either agent alone.
