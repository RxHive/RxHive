# Calcium Gluconate + Calcium Lactobionate

**Generic Name:** Calcium Gluconate + Calcium Lactobionate (combination product;  individual salts are also available)

**Usage:**

This combination is used to treat or prevent low blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia).  The specific indications will depend on the formulation and dosage.  It may be used in various situations, including:

* **Hypocalcemia due to various causes:**  This includes conditions like hypoparathyroidism (underactive parathyroid glands), vitamin D deficiency, kidney disease, and certain medications.
* **Prevention of hypocalcemia during surgery or blood transfusions:** Large-volume blood transfusions can sometimes lower calcium levels.
* **Treatment of hyperkalemia (high potassium levels):** Calcium gluconate, a component of this combination, can help stabilize the heart rhythm in the setting of hyperkalemia. However, it doesn't address the underlying cause of the high potassium.
* **Treatment of calcium channel blocker overdose:**  This is primarily managed by using calcium gluconate intravenously.

**Note:** The specific use and dosage will be determined by a physician based on individual needs and the severity of the condition.  This information is not a substitute for medical advice.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Local reactions (if administered intravenously):**  Pain, burning, or redness at the injection site.
* **Gastrointestinal issues (if taken orally):** Nausea, vomiting, constipation.
* **Less common but more serious side effects:**  These are rare but can include irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure, and allergic reactions.  In case of intravenous administration, rapid infusion can lead to cardiac arrest.

**How it Works:**

Both calcium gluconate and calcium lactobionate are salts of calcium. They work by providing supplemental calcium to the body.  Calcium is essential for many bodily functions, including muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and bone health.  By increasing calcium levels in the blood, this combination helps to correct or prevent the symptoms and complications associated with hypocalcemia.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take this medication with other medications?**  This medication can interact with other drugs, including certain antibiotics, diuretics, and heart medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Contact your doctor for guidance.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **What are the signs of low calcium?**  Symptoms of hypocalcemia can vary but may include muscle cramps, spasms, tingling in the extremities, numbness, and abnormal heart rhythms.
* **How is this medication administered?**  It can be administered intravenously (IV), intramuscularly (IM), or orally depending on the formulation and the clinical situation.  The route of administration is determined by a doctor.
