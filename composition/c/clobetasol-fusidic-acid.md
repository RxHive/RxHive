# Clobetasol + Fusidic Acid

**Generic Name:** Clobetasol Propionate + Fusidic Acid

**Usage:** This combination is a topical corticosteroid and antibiotic used to treat inflammatory skin conditions that are complicated by a bacterial infection.  Specific uses include:

* **Infected eczema (eczema with a bacterial infection):**  This is a common application where the steroid reduces inflammation and itching while the antibiotic tackles the infection.
* **Infected psoriasis (psoriasis with a bacterial infection):** Similar to eczema, this combination treats both inflammation and bacterial infection.
* **Other inflammatory skin conditions with bacterial infection:**  This may include conditions like impetigo or folliculitis, but only under a doctor's prescription and guidance.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the duration of use. Common side effects include:

* **At the application site:** Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, redness, irritation, thinning of the skin, skin discoloration (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation), stretch marks (striae), acne-like rash, folliculitis.
* **Systemic effects (less common, but more likely with prolonged use or large application areas):** These are rare but can include adrenal suppression (especially in children and with large surface area application), increased blood sugar, cataracts, glaucoma.


**How it Works:**

* **Clobetasol Propionate:** This is a potent corticosteroid. It works by reducing inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune system's response in the affected skin. It decreases the production of inflammatory mediators.
* **Fusidic Acid:** This is an antibiotic. It works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, thus stopping the growth and reproduction of bacteria causing the secondary infection.  The combination of these two ingredients tackles both the inflammation and the bacterial infection simultaneously.
