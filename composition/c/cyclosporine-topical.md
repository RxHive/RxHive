# Cyclosporine topical
### Generic Name
Cyclosporine (Topical)

### Usage
Cyclosporine topical is primarily used to treat severe forms of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye disease) that haven't responded to other treatments.  This means it's targeted at cases where the eyes aren't producing enough tears or the tears are of poor quality, leading to significant discomfort and potential damage to the eye surface.  While its primary use is in ophthalmology,  it's important to note that this is a *topical* formulation â€“ meaning it's applied directly to the eyes and not taken orally.  It doesn't treat other forms of eye irritation or infections.


### Dosage
Dosage instructions will always be provided by your ophthalmologist and should be followed precisely.  Typical dosage involves one or two drops in the affected eye(s) twice a day.  The specific amount and frequency will depend on the severity of the dry eye and your individual response to treatment.  There isn't a standardized pediatric dosage because this medication is generally not used in children unless under the direct supervision of an ophthalmologist managing a severe case.  Oral cyclosporine is used for different conditions and has different dosage guidelines.  This information applies only to the topical formulation.  


### Side Effects
Common side effects of topical cyclosporine for the eyes include:

* Burning or stinging sensation upon application
* Eye irritation
* Increased eye watering (paradoxical effect in some)
* Headache
* Blurred vision (temporary)

Less common, but more serious, side effects warrant immediate medical attention and include:

* Eye infections
* Increased eye pressure (glaucoma)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)


If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed as more serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Topical cyclosporine works by suppressing the immune system locally in the eye.  In dry eye disease, an overactive immune response can contribute to inflammation and damage to the eye's surface.  By reducing this inflammatory response, cyclosporine helps to promote the healing and stability of the tear film, relieving symptoms and potentially improving the long-term health of the cornea and conjunctiva.


### Precautions
* **Allergies:**  Individuals with known allergies to cyclosporine should not use this medication.
* **Infections:**  Existing eye infections should be treated before starting cyclosporine, as it could worsen the infection.
* **Contact Lenses:**  It is generally recommended to remove contact lenses before applying the medication and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of topical cyclosporine during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with your doctor to weigh the benefits and potential risks. Limited data exists on its effects during these periods.
* **Other Medications:** Inform your ophthalmologist about all other medications you are currently taking, as interactions may occur.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Blurred vision is a potential side effect.  Exercise caution when driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?**  A:  It may take several weeks to see a noticeable improvement in symptoms.  Consistent use is crucial.

* **Q: Can I stop using it if my eyes feel better?** A:  Do not discontinue use without consulting your ophthalmologist.  Stopping prematurely could lead to a relapse of symptoms.

* **Q: How should I store it?** A:  Store the medication as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Is it safe to use with other eye drops?** A:  Consult your ophthalmologist about the safe use of this medication with other eye drops to avoid potential interactions.  Do not mix drops in the same container.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
