# Cyclosporine topical

**Generic Name:** Cyclosporine

**Usage:** Cyclosporine topical is used to treat severe, recalcitrant forms of keratitis (inflammation of the cornea) and other inflammatory eye conditions unresponsive to other treatments.  Specifically, it's often used for:

* **Dry eye disease (DED):**  Severe cases that don't respond to other therapies.
* **Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC):**  A type of allergic conjunctivitis.
* **Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC):** Another type of allergic keratoconjunctivitis.
* **Neurotrophic keratitis:**  Damage to the cornea due to nerve damage.


**Side Effects:**  Side Effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Burning or stinging:** upon application.
* **Eye irritation:** redness, itching.
* **Increased eye pressure (intraocular pressure):**  This requires monitoring, especially in individuals with glaucoma.
* **Headache:**
* **Blurred vision:** temporary.
* **Infection:** Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppressive effects.
* **Eyelid changes:**  such as swelling or crusting.
* **Photophobia:** increased sensitivity to light.
* **Rare but serious side effects:**  These are less common but can include increased risk of cataracts and glaucoma, and rarely systemic absorption leading to systemic side effects (see FAQs).

**How it Works:** Cyclosporine topical is an immunosuppressant.  It works by inhibiting the production of certain immune system chemicals (cytokines) that contribute to the inflammation in the eye. By reducing the activity of the immune system in the eye, it helps to decrease inflammation and improve the healing process.  It does *not* kill bacteria or viruses directly, but rather targets the inflammatory response.

**FAQs:**

* **How is Cyclosporine Topical applied?**  It's typically applied as eye drops a prescribed number of times per day.  The exact dosage and frequency will be determined by your ophthalmologist.
* **How long does it take to work?**  Improvement may not be seen immediately.  It often takes several weeks of consistent use to notice a significant change in symptoms.
* **Can I use Cyclosporine Topical with other eye drops?**  Talk to your doctor.  There may be interactions with other medications you are using.  Do not use other eye drops unless specifically instructed by your doctor.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Apply the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Can Cyclosporine Topical cause systemic side effects?**  While primarily topical, there is a small chance of systemic absorption, especially with prolonged use or high doses.  This could lead to systemic side effects similar to those seen with oral cyclosporine, such as kidney problems or high blood pressure.  Your doctor will monitor you for these potential side effects.
* **Can I stop using Cyclosporine Topical suddenly?** No.  You should gradually reduce the dose under your doctor's supervision to minimize potential rebound effects.  Stopping suddenly can potentially worsen the underlying condition.
* **Is Cyclosporine Topical safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  The safety of cyclosporine topical during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established. Discuss this with your doctor before using it if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
