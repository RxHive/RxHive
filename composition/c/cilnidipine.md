# Cilnidipine
### Generic Name
Cilnidipine

### Usage

Cilnidipine is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults.  It works by relaxing blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood. This reduction in blood vessel constriction leads to lower blood pressure.  Currently, there are no approved uses of cilnidipine in children.

### Dosage

**Adults (Hypertension):** Cilnidipine is typically administered orally once daily.  The starting dose is usually 5-10 mg.  Your doctor may increase this to a maximum of 20 mg daily, depending on your response to treatment and blood pressure readings.  The medication is usually taken after breakfast.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of cilnidipine in children haven't been established, so it's not recommended for pediatric use.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dose adjustments for renal (kidney) or mild to moderate hepatic (liver) impairment. However, caution is advised when using cilnidipine in patients with severe liver problems.  Always consult your doctor for guidance on appropriate dosage if you have any kidney or liver issues.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of Cilnidipine can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Flushing
* Swelling in the ankles or feet (edema)
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Palpitations

Less common, but more serious side effects, may include:

* Chest pain (angina)
* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias)
* Severe hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Liver enzyme elevation
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching)


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Cilnidipine belongs to a class of drugs called dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. It works by relaxing the blood vessels.  Calcium ions play a crucial role in the contraction of blood vessel muscles. Cilnidipine blocks the entry of calcium ions into these muscle cells, causing them to relax and the blood vessels to widen. This widening reduces blood pressure.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cilnidipine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with a known allergy to cilnidipine or other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, during pregnancy or breastfeeding, in patients with cardiogenic shock, those with a recent heart attack or unstable angina, and those with severe aortic stenosis.

* **Interactions:** Cilnidipine can interact with various medications, including other blood pressure medications, some antibiotics, antifungal agents, and certain herbal remedies.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting cilnidipine.  Grapefruit juice can significantly increase cilnidipine levels and should be avoided.

* **Warnings:**  Cilnidipine should be used with caution in patients with aortic stenosis, severe liver impairment, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and older adults.  Monitor blood pressure and heart rate regularly during treatment.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Cilnidipine is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Safe alternatives should be considered for hypertension management during pregnancy.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Cilnidipine?**

A:  While there's no absolute contraindication, alcohol can lower blood pressure and may increase the risk of side effects, particularly dizziness or lightheadedness.  It's best to limit alcohol consumption while taking Cilnidipine.

**Q: How should I store Cilnidipine?**

A: Store Cilnidipine at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

**Q: Can I stop taking Cilnidipine suddenly?**

A:  No, do not stop taking Cilnidipine abruptly.  Stopping suddenly could lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure. Your doctor should help you gradually reduce your dose before discontinuing treatment.

**Q: How long does it take for Cilnidipine to work?**

A: It may take several weeks to see the full effect of Cilnidipine on your blood pressure.  Regular monitoring of your blood pressure is essential.
