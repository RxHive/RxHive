# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine

**Usage:** This combination drug is typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or flu in adults and children (age restrictions vary depending on specific formulation; always check the product label).  It addresses several symptoms simultaneously:

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  Relieves runny nose and sneezing (antihistamine).
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Suppresses cough (cough suppressant).
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Reduces fever and relieves mild to moderate pain (analgesic and antipyretic).
* **Phenylephrine:**  Reduces nasal congestion (decongestant).


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the specific dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a common side effect of chlorpheniramine and can be significant. Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth, nose, and throat:**  A common effect of antihistamines and decongestants.
* **Headache:** Can be caused by various components of the medication.
* **Nausea:** Relatively uncommon but possible.
* **Constipation:** Possible side effect, especially with higher doses.
* **Dizziness:** Can occur, especially with higher doses or in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressants.
* **Insomnia:** Less common but possible, particularly if taken later in the day.
* **Irritability:**  Possible, especially in children.
* **Allergic reactions:** Though rare, allergic reactions, such as rash, itching, or swelling, are possible. Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.

**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, reducing runny nose and sneezing.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Reduces fever by affecting the areas of the brain that regulate temperature and relieves pain by interfering with the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to pain and inflammation.
* **Phenylephrine:**  Narrows blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
