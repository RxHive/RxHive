# Calcium Citrate Malate + L-Methyl Folate Calcium + Methylcobalamin + Pyridoxal- + Vitamin D

**Generic Name:** Calcium Citrate Malate + L-Methyl Folate Calcium + Methylcobalamin + Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate + Vitamin D3 (Note:  The provided generic name is slightly incomplete; Pyridoxal needs the 5'-phosphate designation for accuracy.  Vitamin D also needs specification of the form, Vitamin D3 being most common.)

**Usage:** This combination supplement is primarily designed to address deficiencies in several essential nutrients crucial for overall health and neurological function.  Its main use targets individuals with deficiencies in calcium, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin B6 (as pyridoxal-5'-phosphate), and vitamin D. These deficiencies can manifest in various ways, including:

* **Calcium Deficiency:**  Can lead to weakened bones (osteoporosis, osteomalacia), muscle cramps, and increased risk of fractures.
* **Folate Deficiency (L-Methylfolate):**  Can cause anemia, fatigue, neurological problems, and birth defects (especially crucial during pregnancy). L-methylfolate is a more bioavailable form of folate than folic acid.
* **Vitamin B12 Deficiency (Methylcobalamin):** Can result in pernicious anemia, fatigue, neurological damage (including peripheral neuropathy and cognitive impairment), and gastrointestinal problems. Methylcobalamin is a highly bioavailable form of B12.
* **Vitamin B6 Deficiency (Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate):** Can cause anemia, skin problems, depression, confusion, and weakened immune system. Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate is the active form of vitamin B6.
* **Vitamin D Deficiency:**  Contributes to weakened bones (rickets in children, osteoporosis in adults), muscle weakness, increased risk of infections, and mood disturbances.

Secondary uses might include supporting bone health in individuals at risk of osteoporosis or those recovering from fractures, improving neurological function in specific conditions, and generally enhancing overall well-being through nutrient replenishment.  However, it's crucial to remember this is *not* a treatment for specific diseases but a means to address nutritional deficiencies that may contribute to or exacerbate certain conditions.

**Dosage:**  Dosage will vary greatly depending on individual needs, age, health status, and the severity of any deficiencies.  A healthcare professional should determine the appropriate dosage based on laboratory tests and a comprehensive assessment.  The formulation is typically available as tablets or capsules.  There are no standard pediatric dosages, as pediatric dosages always require careful medical supervision.  Instructions should be followed precisely as prescribed by a doctor.

**Side Effects:**

* **Common:**  Mild gastrointestinal upset (nausea, constipation, diarrhea), headache.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling),  severe digestive issues.
* **Note:**  This list is not exhaustive. If you experience any adverse effects, seek medical attention immediately.

**How it Works:**  This combination supplement works by providing the body with essential nutrients that are often deficient. Each nutrient plays a vital role in various bodily functions:

* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** Improves calcium absorption and supports bone health.
* **L-Methylfolate:**  Participates in DNA synthesis and cell division, crucial for red blood cell production and neurological function.
* **Methylcobalamin:**  Essential for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis.
* **Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate:**  Plays a key role in numerous metabolic processes, including protein metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis.
* **Vitamin D3:** Regulates calcium and phosphorus absorption, promoting bone health and immune function.

**Popular Brand Names (India):**  Specific brand names vary significantly by region and manufacturer.  It's best to check with a local pharmacist or consult a doctor for recommendations on specific brands available in India.


**Precautions:**

* **Contraindications:**  Individuals with known allergies to any of the ingredients should avoid this supplement.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Consult a doctor about potential interactions with other medications, particularly those affecting calcium absorption or blood clotting.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult a doctor before using this supplement during pregnancy or breastfeeding, as the appropriate dosage might differ.
* **Children and Older Adults:**  Dosages should be carefully determined by a healthcare professional, considering their specific needs and health status.
