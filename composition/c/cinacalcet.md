# Cinacalcet
### Generic Name
Cinacalcet

### Usage
Cinacalcet is primarily used to manage secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are undergoing dialysis.  Secondary HPT is a condition where the parathyroid glands overproduce parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to high calcium levels in the blood.  Cinacalcet helps to lower PTH levels, thereby controlling calcium levels.

Beyond its primary use, cinacalcet is also indicated for treating hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) in adults with parathyroid carcinoma (a type of cancer of the parathyroid glands) and in adults with primary HPT (where the parathyroid glands are overactive, but not due to CKD). In these cases, it's typically used when surgery isn't an option or isn't immediately feasible.  It's important to note that cinacalcet is *not* recommended for CKD patients who aren't on dialysis due to a heightened risk of hypocalcemia (low blood calcium).


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific condition being treated and the patient's response.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescribed dosage regimen precisely.  The following information provides a general overview, not a prescription:

**Adults:**

* **Secondary Hyperparathyroidism:**  Treatment typically starts with 30 mg once daily (OD), gradually increasing the dose as needed under medical supervision to maintain the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level within a target range (usually 150-300 pg/mL).  The maximum dose can reach 180 mg OD.  Cinacalcet may be used alone or in combination with other medications like vitamin D and phosphate binders.  Switching from another medication, like etelcalcetide, to cinacalcet requires a washout period (at least 4 weeks).

* **Primary Hyperparathyroidism:** Initial dosage is usually 30 mg twice daily (BID), with potential increases (to 60 mg BID, 90 mg BID, and even higher doses if necessary) to achieve target serum calcium levels.


* **Parathyroid Carcinoma:**  Treatment begins with 30 mg, with potential increases up to a maximum of 90 mg three or four times a day (TID or QID), again based on individual response and serum calcium levels.


**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of cinacalcet in children haven't been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments might be necessary in patients with moderate-to-severe liver impairment or those taking other medications that can interact with cinacalcet. Renal impairment generally doesn't necessitate dosage changes.  Close monitoring of calcium, phosphorus, and PTH levels is vital, particularly when adjusting dosages.  If hypocalcemia occurs, the dose may need to be reduced or temporarily stopped.

**Administration:** Cinacalcet tablets should be swallowed whole; do not crush or break them.  They're generally taken with food or shortly after a meal.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Cough
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium)
* Muscle spasms
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Back pain


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Seizures
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding


Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Cinacalcet is a calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) agonist.  CaSRs are found on the parathyroid glands.  Cinacalcet increases the sensitivity of these receptors to calcium. This enhanced sensitivity triggers a reduction in the production and release of parathyroid hormone (PTH), thereby lowering calcium levels in the blood.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cinacalcet is contraindicated in individuals with a known allergy to the drug or its components and those with hypocalcemia (low blood calcium) before starting treatment.

* **Drug Interactions:** Cinacalcet can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by the liver enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, for example, may require cinacalcet dosage adjustment.

* **Warnings:**  Patients with a history of seizures, moderate-to-severe liver problems, or those receiving medications that can lower calcium levels should be carefully monitored.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Cinacalcet falls into pregnancy category C, meaning the risk to a developing fetus isn't fully established.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown. The decision to use cinacalcet during pregnancy or breastfeeding requires careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks by a healthcare provider.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take cinacalcet with other medications?**
A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting cinacalcet, as it can interact with some drugs.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.


**Q: How should I store cinacalcet?**
A: Store cinacalcet as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.


**Q: What are the signs of hypocalcemia?**
A: Symptoms of hypocalcemia include muscle cramps, tingling in the extremities (paresthesias), muscle spasms, and in severe cases, seizures.


**Q: How often do I need to have my blood checked?**
A: Your doctor will schedule blood tests (monitoring calcium, phosphorus, and PTH levels) based on your condition and response to treatment. Regular monitoring is essential.
