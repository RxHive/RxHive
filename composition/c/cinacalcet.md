# Cinacalcet

**Generic Name:** Cinacalcet

**Usage:**

Cinacalcet is used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are on dialysis.  It's also used to treat secondary HPT in patients with CKD who are *not* on dialysis, but only if they have certain symptoms or high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) that haven't responded to other treatments.  In addition, cinacalcet is used to treat hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) in patients with parathyroid carcinoma.  The specific dosage and frequency will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and response to treatment.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Muscle cramps
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Weakness
* Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) â€“ this is a serious side effect and requires monitoring.

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Severe hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Seizures
* Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
* Worsening of kidney function


**How it Works:**

Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent.  It works by lowering levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the blood.  It does this by binding to calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) on the parathyroid glands.  This binding mimics the effect of calcium, leading to decreased PTH secretion.  Lowering PTH helps to reduce elevated calcium levels in the blood and improve bone health in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effect of cinacalcet on PTH levels may be noticeable within a few weeks, but optimal effects might take longer to achieve.
* **Q: Do I need regular blood tests?** A: Yes, regular blood tests (including calcium, phosphorus, and PTH levels) are necessary to monitor your response to treatment and check for side effects, especially hypocalcemia.
* **Q: Can I take cinacalcet with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking. Interactions are possible, and your doctor will need to assess potential risks.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any significant or concerning side effects.
* **Q: Can I stop taking cinacalcet suddenly?** A: No, you should never stop taking cinacalcet suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a rapid rebound in PTH levels.
* **Q: Is cinacalcet safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: The safety of cinacalcet during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before taking it if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.
