# Carboprost

**Generic Name:** Carboprost Tromethamine

**Usage:** Carboprost Tromethamine is a synthetic prostaglandin analog used primarily to:

* **Control postpartum hemorrhage (PPH):** This is its most common use.  It's administered intramuscularly or intravenously to stimulate uterine contractions and reduce bleeding after childbirth.
* **Induce abortion:**  It can be used to induce abortion, particularly in later stages of pregnancy, although its use for this purpose is less common now due to the availability of other methods.
* **Treat incomplete abortion:**  It can help to expel retained products of conception following a miscarriage or abortion.

**Side Effects:** Carboprost Tromethamine can cause several side effects, some common and some serious. These include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, headache, flushing, abdominal pain, hypertension (high blood pressure), dizziness.
* **Serious:** Bronchospasm (wheezing and shortness of breath â€“ particularly concerning for asthmatics), hypotension (low blood pressure), cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), seizures, uterine rupture (especially with high doses or in the presence of uterine scars), pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs).  Anaphylactic reactions, though rare, are possible.

**How it Works:** Carboprost Tromethamine mimics the effects of prostaglandins, naturally occurring substances in the body that play a role in uterine contractions. By binding to receptors in the uterus, it stimulates strong contractions, helping to control bleeding and expel uterine contents.  It also affects smooth muscle in other parts of the body, which contributes to some of its side effects.
