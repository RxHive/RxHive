# Carboprost
### Generic Name
Carboprost

### Usage
Carboprost, a synthetic analog of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2α), is primarily used in two critical medical situations:

* **Termination of pregnancy:**  Carboprost is used to induce uterine contractions leading to the expulsion of the products of conception.  It's typically employed for pregnancies between 13 and 20 weeks gestation.  It's important to note that carboprost itself isn't feticidal (doesn't directly kill the fetus); its action is to stimulate strong uterine contractions that result in pregnancy termination.

* **Treatment of refractory postpartum hemorrhage (PPH):** In cases where more conservative methods of managing postpartum bleeding (such as oxytocin and uterine massage) fail, carboprost may be used as a last resort to stimulate uterine contractions and control bleeding.  This is only considered when other methods are ineffective or contraindicated.


### Dosage

**Important Note:** Carboprost is a potent medication requiring administration by trained medical professionals in a setting with intensive care and surgical capabilities. The dosage information below should *not* be interpreted as a guide for self-medication.

**Termination of Pregnancy (Intramuscular - IM):**

* **Initial Dose:** 250 mcg; a 100 mcg test dose may be considered initially.
* **Maintenance Dose:** If the initial dose is effective and uterine contractions are satisfactory, the next dose may be administered every 1.5 to 3.5 hours as needed.  The maximum total dose is 1200 mcg, or up to two days of continuous administration.  Higher doses (e.g., 500 mcg) may be considered if the response to 250 mcg doses is insufficient.

**Refractory Postpartum Hemorrhage (Intramuscular - IM):**

* **Initial Dose:** 250 mcg.
* **Maintenance Dose:**  Repeat doses of 250 mcg can be given every 15-90 minutes, if necessary, but the total dose should not exceed 2000 mcg or 8 doses.  Again, this is only appropriate when other methods for controlling postpartum bleeding have failed.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of carboprost in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Carboprost is contraindicated in patients with active hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Use with caution in patients with a history of either condition.



### Side Effects

Carboprost can cause a range of side effects, varying in frequency and severity.  The following list includes both common and less frequent, but potentially serious, side effects:

* **Cardiovascular:** Chest pain, chest tightness, flushing, hypertension (high blood pressure), palpitations, septic shock, syncope (fainting), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), and vasodepressor syncope.
* **Nervous System:** Anxiety, chills, choking sensation, disturbed sleep, dizziness, drowsiness, dystonia (muscle spasms), headache, fever (possibly drug-induced or related to infection), lethargy, nervousness, paresthesia (numbness or tingling), shivering, and vertigo (dizziness).
* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, altered taste, epigastric pain (upper abdominal pain), gag reflex, hematemesis (vomiting blood), hiccups, retching, and dry mouth.
* **Genitourinary:** Breast tenderness, cervical perforation, endometritis (uterine infection), pelvic pain, retained placenta fragments, urinary tract infection, uterine perforation, uterine rupture, uterine hemorrhage.
* **Dermatologic:** Sweating, skin rash.
* **Respiratory:** Asthma exacerbation, bronchospasm (constriction of the airways), cough, dry throat, dyspnea (shortness of breath), nosebleed, hyperventilation, pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), respiratory distress, throat irritation, upper respiratory infection, wheezing.
* **Other:** Pain at injection site, back pain, leg cramps, muscle pain, neck stiffness, weakness, blepharospasm (eyelid spasms), blurred vision, eye pain, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), hot flashes, increased thirst, and, rarely, thyroid storm.
* **Hypersensitivity Reactions (rare but serious):**  Anaphylactic shock, anaphylactoid reactions, anaphylaxis, angioedema.

**If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works

Carboprost is a prostaglandin analog that works by stimulating the contraction of uterine smooth muscle.  This action is responsible for its use in both pregnancy termination and the control of postpartum hemorrhage. In pregnancy termination, the contractions lead to expulsion of the uterine contents. In PPH, the contractions help to constrict blood vessels and reduce bleeding.  Carboprost may also modulate the effects of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter involved in blood vessel constriction.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Carboprost is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, active pelvic inflammatory disease, and active cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with a history of renal or hepatic disease, anemia, asthma, cardiovascular disease, compromised uterus, diabetes mellitus, or seizure disorders.  Transient fever is a potential side effect, and care must be taken to distinguish it from fever related to infection.
* **Drug Interactions:** Carboprost can enhance the effects of oxytocin and other oxytocic drugs (drugs that stimulate uterine contractions).
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Carboprost is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the potential risks to a developing fetus are not fully known.  Its excretion in breast milk is also not established.
* **Administration:** Carboprost is for intramuscular (IM) injection only; it should never be administered intravenously (IV).

### FAQs

* **Q: How is carboprost stored?** A:  Specific storage recommendations may vary depending on the formulation, so always refer to the product labeling. Generally, it should be stored at a controlled room temperature, protected from light and moisture.

* **Q: How long does it take for carboprost to work?** A: The onset and duration of action can vary, but uterine contractions typically begin relatively soon after injection.  The time to complete expulsion of uterine contents depends on several factors, including the gestational age of the pregnancy.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not attempt to self-adjust dosages. Consult your healthcare provider immediately for guidance.

* **Q: Can I take other medications while using carboprost?** A: Inform your doctor about all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal supplements) you are currently taking.  Some medications may interact with carboprost.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with carboprost use?** A:  Long-term effects are not generally expected, but it’s crucial to follow up with your physician as advised.
