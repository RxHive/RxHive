# Clobetasol + Ammonium Lactate

**Generic Name:** Clobetasol Propionate + Ammonium Lactate

**Usage:** This combination is typically used topically (applied to the skin) to treat skin conditions characterized by both inflammation and scaling, such as:

* **Psoriasis:**  Specifically plaque psoriasis, where thick, scaly patches are present.
* **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis):**  Helps reduce inflammation and itching associated with eczema.
* **Other inflammatory skin conditions:**  May be used for other conditions with similar characteristics, but this should always be under a doctor's supervision.

**Important Note:** This combination is a potent corticosteroid. It's not for widespread use or long-term treatment without strict medical guidance.  It's often reserved for severe cases unresponsive to milder treatments.


**Side Effects:**  Because it's a potent corticosteroid, side effects are possible, especially with prolonged use or application to large areas:

* **Skin thinning (atrophy):**  This is a major concern with potent topical steroids.
* **Striae (stretch marks):**  Appearance of reddish streaks on the skin.
* **Telangiectasia (spider veins):**  Small, dilated blood vessels visible on the skin.
* **Purpura (bruising):** Increased tendency to bruise.
* **Burning, itching, or irritation:** At the application site.
* **Acneiform eruptions:** Acne-like breakouts.
* **Hirsurtism (increased hair growth):** Particularly in women.
* **Hypopigmentation (loss of skin color):**  Skin becomes lighter in the treated area.
* **Infection:**  Increased risk of skin infections, especially with occlusive dressings.
* **Systemic effects (rare but possible with extensive use):**  These can include Cushing's syndrome symptoms (e.g., weight gain, high blood sugar), adrenal suppression (the body's natural cortisol production is suppressed), and others.

**How it Works:**

* **Clobetasol Propionate:** This is a potent corticosteroid. It works by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune system in the skin.  This helps to lessen swelling, redness, itching, and scaling.
* **Ammonium Lactate:** This acts as a keratolytic agent, meaning it helps to soften and remove scales and thickened skin.  It helps to improve penetration of the clobetasol into the affected area.  It also has some hydrating properties.

The combination of these two ingredients provides a synergistic effect, targeting both the inflammation and the scaling aspects of the skin condition.
