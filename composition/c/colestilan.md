# Colestilan
### Generic Name
Colestilan (colestimide)

### Usage

Colestilan is primarily used to manage hyperphosphatemia in adults with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.  Hyperphosphatemia is a condition where there's too much phosphate in the blood, a common complication of kidney failure.  Colestilan works by binding to phosphate in the digestive tract, preventing its absorption into the bloodstream and thus lowering serum phosphorus levels.

Colestilan also possesses lipid-lowering properties similar to colestyramine.  While its primary indication is for hyperphosphatemia, it can be used as an adjunct in managing hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol) though this is less common than its use in managing hyperphosphatemia associated with CKD.  Research is also exploring its potential role in managing diabetes mellitus, but this is still under investigation and not yet a standard clinical application.


### Dosage

**Hyperphosphatemia (Adults with Stage 5 CKD on Dialysis):**

* **Oral:** The recommended starting dose is 6-9 grams per day, divided into 2-3 doses. This starting dose is appropriate even for patients previously on other phosphate binders.  The dose can be increased by 3 grams per day (1 gram three times daily) as needed, based on serum phosphorus levels. The maximum dose is 15 grams per day (5 grams three times daily). Long-term treatment is typically required.

**Hyperlipidemia (Adults):**

* **Oral:** The usual dose is 1.5 grams twice daily, taken with food.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Colestilan in children under 18 years of age have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for renal impairment according to the manufacturer's labeling. Colestilan has not been studied in pre-dialysis patients.  Use is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, decreased appetite, dyspepsia (indigestion).
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Intestinal obstruction, ileus/subileus, hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia (especially in patients with renal insufficiency), folate deficiency, vitamin K deficiency, hypertriglyceridemia, abnormal liver function test results,  hyperparathyroidism,  calciphylaxis, electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, headache, dizziness, insomnia, tremor, rash, urticaria, muscle spasms, hypotension, GI hemorrhage, and asthenia (weakness).

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Colestilan is a non-absorbed, non-calcium, non-metallic phosphate-binding polymer.  In the stomach, its binding sites become partially protonated.  In the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine), it binds to both dietary phosphate anions and bile acids through ionic and hydrogen bonding. This binding prevents the absorption of phosphate into the bloodstream, thus lowering serum phosphorus levels.  The binding of bile acids also contributes to lowering LDL cholesterol.  Additionally, alterations in the bile acid pool within the gastrointestinal tract may contribute to lower serum glucose levels.  Colestilan may also bind uric acid in the GI tract.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Colestilan is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to colestilan or any of its components, and in those with bowel obstruction.

**Warnings:**  Increased risk of intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus exists.  Patients with renal insufficiency are at increased risk of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia. Long-term use can lead to folate deficiency.  Hypothyroidism and alterations in systemic ion balance (elevated chloride and reduced bicarbonate) may occur.

**Use with Caution:** Colestilan should be used cautiously in patients with conditions predisposing to gastrointestinal bleeding (e.g., ulcers, gastritis, diverticulosis, colitis, hemorrhoids, recent GI hemorrhage), those susceptible to vitamin K or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (e.g., malabsorption syndromes, patients on warfarin), and those receiving immunosuppressants.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Colestilan with other medications?** A: Colestilan can interact with other drugs, potentially affecting their absorption.  Administer other medications at least 1 hour before or 3 hours after taking Colestilan. Close monitoring is needed if taking medications with a narrow therapeutic index.  Closer monitoring of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is recommended if taking levothyroxine.

* **Q: How should I store Colestilan?** A: Store as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is Colestilan safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: Colestilan is categorized as pregnancy category B.  Whether it's excreted in breast milk is unknown.  Supplementing vitamins may be necessary in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Consult your doctor before taking Colestilan if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking Colestilan abruptly?** A: Do not stop taking Colestilan without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly may have implications for your condition.
