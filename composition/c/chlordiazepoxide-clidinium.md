# Chlordiazepoxide + Clidinium

**Generic Name:** Chlordiazepoxide + Clidinium

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to treat symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with symptoms predominantly involving diarrhea.  It combines a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide) which has anti-anxiety and muscle relaxant properties, with an anticholinergic (clidinium) which reduces gut motility.  The medication is primarily used to alleviate abdominal cramps, pain, and diarrhea associated with IBS.  It's important to note that this combination is less commonly prescribed now due to the availability of newer, more targeted IBS treatments.  Its use should be considered only after other therapies have been explored.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can be significant and vary depending on individual sensitivity.  Common side effects include:

* **Anticholinergic effects:** Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, difficulty urinating, increased heart rate.
* **Benzodiazepine effects:** Drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, lightheadedness, weakness, incoordination, impaired coordination, memory problems, paradoxical anxiety or excitement (especially in elderly patients).
* **Other possible side effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, headache, skin rash, allergic reactions.

Serious side effects are less common but can include:

* **Glaucoma worsening:**  Especially in patients with pre-existing glaucoma.
* **Urinary retention:**  Especially in patients with prostate problems.
* **Increased risk of falls:** Due to drowsiness and impaired coordination.
* **Paradoxical reactions:**  Increased anxiety or agitation.
* **Withdrawal symptoms:** If stopped abruptly after long-term use.


**How it Works:**

* **Chlordiazepoxide:**  Reduces anxiety and acts as a muscle relaxant, relieving abdominal spasms and pain associated with IBS. It works by enhancing the effect of GABA, a neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve impulses in the brain and central nervous system.

* **Clidinium:**  Reduces gut motility (movement of the intestines) by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates intestinal muscle contractions. This helps slow down bowel movements and reduce diarrhea.


**FAQs:**

* **Is this medication habit-forming?** Yes, chlordiazepoxide is a benzodiazepine and carries a risk of dependence with prolonged use.  It should only be used for a short period as directed by a doctor.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** No, alcohol should be avoided as it can increase the sedative effects of chlordiazepoxide and lead to dangerous interactions.

* **When should I contact my doctor?** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience severe side effects, such as difficulty breathing, severe allergic reactions, or worsening of symptoms.

* **Are there alternatives to this medication?** Yes, many newer and more specific medications are available for the treatment of IBS. Your doctor can discuss these options with you.
