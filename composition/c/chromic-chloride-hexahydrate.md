# Chromic Chloride Hexahydrate
### Generic Name
Chromic Chloride Hexahydrate

### Usage
Chromic chloride hexahydrate is primarily used as a chromium supplement in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions.  TPN is a method of providing nutritional support intravenously, bypassing the digestive system.  Chromium plays a vital role in glucose metabolism and is crucial for maintaining normal glucose tolerance, peripheral nerve function, and preventing deficiencies that can lead to conditions such as impaired glucose tolerance, ataxia (loss of muscle coordination), peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities), and confusional states.  Its use is primarily preventative, aiming to maintain adequate chromium levels in individuals who are unable to receive adequate nutrition through the normal oral route.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Chromium Supplement for TPN):**

* Intravenous (IV): 10-15 mcg/day.  This can increase to 20 mcg/day in cases of significant intestinal fluid loss.

**Pediatric Dosage (Chromium Supplement for TPN):**

Dosage varies based on weight and age.  Refer to manufacturerâ€™s labeling and ASPEN guidelines (Mirtallo 2004):

* **Infants (3-10 kg):** 0.2 mcg/kg/day IV
* **Children (10-40 kg):** 0.14-0.2 mcg/kg/day IV
* **Adolescents (>40 kg):** 5-15 mcg/day IV

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided.  However, caution is advised, and dose reduction or omission may be considered in patients with severe kidney disease, especially in pediatric patients (per ASPEN guidelines).


### Side Effects

Common side effects are not extensively documented for chromic chloride hexahydrate when administered as part of TPN. However, potential adverse effects related to chromium excess or the administration method (IV) should be considered:

* Injection site reactions (pain, inflammation)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

Serious but less common side effects are rare but can include:

* Respiratory problems (irritation, depression)
* Aluminum toxicity (with prolonged use or high doses, especially in patients with renal impairment).


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Chromic chloride hexahydrate provides chromium in a bioavailable form. Chromium is an essential trace mineral that plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism by enhancing the activity of insulin.  By ensuring adequate chromium levels, this medication helps maintain normal glucose tolerance and prevent the development of neurological complications associated with chromium deficiency.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to chromic chloride hexahydrate or its components, and direct intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) injection without appropriate dilution.
* **Warnings:**  Increased risk of aluminum toxicity, especially with high doses, prolonged use, or in patients with renal impairment (Chromic chloride solutions may contain aluminum).  
* **Use with Caution:** In patients with renal impairment, older adults, and during pregnancy and breastfeeding (Category C). The excretion of chromic chloride in breast milk is unknown.
* **Administration:**  Do not administer undiluted by direct injection into a peripheral vein.  Always follow proper intravenous administration guidelines.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is chromic chloride hexahydrate stored?** A: Storage instructions should be found on the product label, but generally, it involves storing it at room temperature and away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: Can I take chromic chloride hexahydrate orally?** A: No, chromic chloride hexahydrate is for intravenous use only as part of a TPN solution and should not be taken orally.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A:  Since it is administered as part of a TPN regimen, missing a dose should be addressed with the healthcare provider managing the TPN. Do not attempt to adjust the dosage independently.
* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of chromic chloride hexahydrate?** A:  Long-term effects are largely unknown, but monitoring for potential aluminum toxicity, especially in individuals with kidney problems, is crucial.  Proper monitoring by a healthcare professional is vital.
* **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?** A: Interactions with other drugs are not well-documented, but informing your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking is always essential.
