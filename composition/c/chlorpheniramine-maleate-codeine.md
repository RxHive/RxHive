# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Codeine
### Generic Name
Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Codeine

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, or other upper respiratory allergies.  It combines the effects of two active ingredients: chlorpheniramine maleate and codeine.

* **Chlorpheniramine maleate** is an antihistamine that helps to reduce symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes caused by allergies or the common cold. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.

* **Codeine** is an opioid cough suppressant (antitussive). It works by affecting the area of the brain that controls coughing. This helps to reduce the frequency and intensity of coughs.

Therefore, this combination medication is effective in alleviating both the allergic symptoms and the cough associated with upper respiratory illnesses.  It's important to note that this is a symptomatic treatment; it doesn't cure the underlying illness.  It's crucial to consult a doctor if symptoms persist or worsen.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary greatly depending on the specific formulation (tablet, syrup, etc.), the age and weight of the patient, and the severity of their symptoms.  **It is absolutely crucial to follow the prescription instructions given by your doctor or pharmacist.**  Never exceed the recommended dose.  There is no standard dosage information that can be provided here due to the variability in formulations and individual needs.

* **Oral Dosage:**  Oral forms (tablets, capsules, syrups) will have specific dosage instructions printed on the label and accompanying patient leaflet.  These instructions should be followed precisely.

* **IV Dosage:** This combination medication is not typically administered intravenously (IV).  Codeine is usually administered orally or sometimes intramuscularly, but never intravenously in this combination.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Blurred vision
* Headache

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Fast or irregular heartbeat

* Low blood pressure
* Difficulty urinating

**If you experience any serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.**  Even common side effects can become problematic, so consult your healthcare provider if they are bothersome or persistent.


### How it Works

As mentioned previously, this medication works through the combined action of its two ingredients. Chlorpheniramine maleate blocks histamine receptors, reducing allergic symptoms. Codeine suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the brain's cough center.  The combination effectively tackles both the allergic symptoms and the cough associated with respiratory illnesses.
