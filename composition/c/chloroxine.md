# Chloroxine
### Generic Name
Chloroxine

### Usage

Chloroxine is a medication with antibacterial and antifungal properties.  Its primary use is topical treatment of dandruff and mild-to-moderately severe seborrheic dermatitis (a common skin condition causing scaly patches) of the scalp.  It's also used orally in some regions for the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea, although this use is less common in many areas.  The oral form may be considered for specific types of diarrhea, such as that caused by amoebic dysentery or giardiasis, but this should only be done under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Topical (Shampoo):**  For dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis, a 2% Chloroxine shampoo is typically applied twice a week.  The shampoo should be massaged thoroughly into the wet scalp, allowed to lather for approximately 3 minutes, and then rinsed thoroughly.  Repeat the application and rinsing process.


**Oral:**  For acute infectious diarrhea in adults, the usual dose is 250 mg three times daily (TID).  Treatment generally lasts 2-3 days, or until the stool normalizes.  In more severe cases (amoebic dysentery, giardiasis), treatment may extend to 7-10 days under strict medical supervision.  A healthcare provider should be consulted if symptoms persist after 2-3 days, worsen, or if blood appears in the stool.  In more serious cases, a second course of treatment may be considered after a week's break, but only after consulting with a doctor.

**Pediatric Dosage (Oral):** Oral Chloroxine is generally not recommended for children weighing 40 kg (approximately 88 lbs) or less.  For children and adolescents weighing over 40 kg, the dosage is the same as for adults, but should only be administered under strict medical supervision.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  For both topical and oral administration, no dosage adjustment is usually needed for mild-to-moderate hepatic or renal impairment. However, in cases of severe hepatic or renal impairment, oral Chloroxine is contraindicated (should not be used).


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Topical):**

* Skin rash
* Local irritation
* Burning sensation on the scalp
* Contact dermatitis
* Discoloration of light-colored hair (blond, gray, bleached)

**Common Side Effects (Oral):**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Rash

**Serious (Less Common) Side Effects:** While rare, serious side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning symptoms.


### How it Works

The exact mechanism of action of Chloroxine isn't fully understood.  Topically, it's thought to slow down cell division (mitotic activity) in the epidermis (outer skin layer), thus reducing excessive scaling associated with dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis.  Regarding its oral use, it's known to induce DNA repair in bacteria, suggesting a potential mechanism for its antibacterial effects.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Chloroxine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to Chloroxine or any formulation components. For topical use, it should not be applied to acutely inflamed lesions. For oral use, it's contraindicated in individuals with severe hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

* **Warnings:** Use with caution in pregnant and breastfeeding women.  It should also be used cautiously in patients with known sensitivity to hydroxyquinolines or edetate disodium.

* **Interactions:** The potential for drug interactions with Chloroxine needs to be considered, especially if taking other medications. Consult a healthcare provider about any potential interactions.
