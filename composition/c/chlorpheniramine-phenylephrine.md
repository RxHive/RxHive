### How it Works

Chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions. This helps to reduce symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itching.  Phenylephrine is a decongestant that constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, thereby reducing swelling and relieving nasal congestion.
