# Ciprofloxacin + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose

**Generic Name:** Ciprofloxacin + Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC) ophthalmic solution

**Usage:** This combination is typically used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and other bacterial infections of the eye.  The ciprofloxacin is the antibiotic that targets the bacteria, while the HPMC acts as a lubricant and viscosity-increasing agent, helping the medication stay in contact with the eye longer for improved effectiveness.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Eye irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness, dryness.
* **Allergic reactions:**  In rare cases, more severe allergic reactions like swelling of the eyelids or face, difficulty breathing.
* **Visual disturbances:** Blurred vision, temporary changes in vision.
* **Headache:** Less common.

**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, stop use and consult a doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.

**How it Works:**

* **Ciprofloxacin:** This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. This prevents the bacteria from multiplying and eventually kills them.  It's effective against a wide range of gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria.

* **Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC):** This is a cellulose derivative that acts as a lubricating and viscosity-building agent.  It helps to prolong the contact time of the ciprofloxacin with the infected eye tissues, enhancing its effectiveness and reducing the frequency of application.  It also helps to alleviate dryness and irritation.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How often should I use this medication?** A:  The frequency of application will be prescribed by your doctor or ophthalmologist, typically several times a day.  Follow the instructions precisely.

* **Q: How long should I use this medication?** A:  Continue using the medication for the full duration prescribed by your doctor, even if your symptoms improve.  Stopping early can lead to recurrence of the infection.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I wear contact lenses while using this medication?** A:  Generally, you should avoid wearing contact lenses while using this medication.  Consult your ophthalmologist for specific instructions.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A:  While less common with topical eye drops, it's important to inform your doctor or ophthalmologist of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Q:  Can I use this for other types of eye infections?** A: No. This medication is specifically for bacterial infections.  It will not be effective against viral or fungal infections.  A proper diagnosis is essential.
