# Calcifediol
### Generic Name
Calcifediol

### Usage
Calcifediol is primarily used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults.  This condition occurs when the parathyroid glands produce excessive parathyroid hormone (PTH), often as a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD).  It's specifically indicated for adults with stage 3 or 4 CKD who also have low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (less than 30 ng/mL).  Calcifediol helps to regulate calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood, reducing the burden on the parathyroid glands and improving overall bone health.  It is important to note that calcifediol is not a first-line treatment for CKD and should be used under the strict guidance of a nephrologist or other qualified healthcare professional.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (for secondary hyperparathyroidism):** Calcifediol is typically administered orally.  The initial dose is usually 30 mcg once daily at bedtime.  This is contingent on the serum calcium level being below 9.8 mg/dL before starting treatment. After three months, the dosage may be increased to 60 mcg once daily at bedtime if the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels remain above the target range.  The goal is to maintain serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 30-100 ng/mL, iPTH levels within the therapeutic range, serum calcium levels below 9.8 mg/dL, and serum phosphorus levels at or below 5.5 mg/dL.  Dosage adjustments are made based on regular monitoring of these parameters.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of calcifediol in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) impairment.  No dose adjustment is necessary for renal (kidney) impairment, although careful monitoring is crucial given the existing renal dysfunction.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include hyperphosphatemia (high phosphorus levels in the blood).

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include anemia, nasopharyngitis (common cold), increased blood creatinine, dyspnea (shortness of breath), hypercalcemia (high calcium levels), cough, congestive heart failure, constipation, bronchitis, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), osteoarthritis, hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels), contusion (bruise), pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  This list is not exhaustive.

Serious side effects, although less common, can include significantly elevated calcium and phosphorus levels.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Calcifediol is a vitamin D analog.  In the body, it's converted to calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D) primarily by the kidneys.  Calcitriol then binds to vitamin D receptors in various tissues, influencing calcium and phosphorus absorption in the intestines and regulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) production. This ultimately helps to control calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood and improve bone health.

### Precautions
Calcifediol is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to calcifediol or its components.  There's an increased risk of hypercalcemia (high calcium levels) and hyperphosphatemia (high phosphorus levels) with calcifediol use.  Patients with pre-existing hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia should be carefully monitored.  The risk of digitalis toxicity (if also taking digitalis medications) is increased, along with potential worsening of adynamic bone disease.  Concomitant use with thiazide diuretics may increase the risk of hypercalcemia, requiring close monitoring of serum calcium levels.  Calcifediol's interaction with other medications, like CYP3A inhibitors, cholestyramine, and anticonvulsants, may alter its metabolism and effectiveness.  Careful consideration and potential dose adjustments are necessary in these instances.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the use of calcifediol with their healthcare provider due to limited data on its safety during pregnancy and lactation.  This medication should be used with caution in older adults due to increased risk of adverse effects related to calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.

### FAQs
**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

**Q: How should I store calcifediol?**
A: Store calcifediol as directed on the product label.  Generally, it should be kept at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

**Q: What are the signs of hypercalcemia I should watch for?**
A: Signs of hypercalcemia include fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, excessive thirst (polydipsia), excessive urination (polyuria), and weight loss. Report these symptoms immediately.

**Q: Can I take calcifediol with other medications?**
A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as some may interact with calcifediol.  Do not start, stop, or change any medications without consulting your doctor or pharmacist.

**Q: Is calcifediol safe for long-term use?**
A: Long-term use requires regular monitoring of blood calcium and phosphorus levels by your doctor to minimize risks and optimize treatment effectiveness.
