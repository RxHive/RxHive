# Cefalexin + Bromhexine
### Generic Name
Cefalexin + Bromhexine (Combination)


**Note:**  Cefalexin and Bromhexine are often combined in over-the-counter medications, but it's crucial to understand that this is not a single, officially defined generic medicine with a single monograph.  The combination is used to treat specific respiratory infections, leveraging the antibiotic properties of Cefalexin and the expectorant effect of Bromhexine.  Always refer to the specific product information provided by the manufacturer for accurate dosing and precaution information, as formulations can vary.


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat respiratory tract infections that involve both bacterial infection and excessive mucus production.  Cefalexin, a cephalosporin antibiotic, targets and kills bacteria responsible for the infection. Bromhexine, an expectorant, helps to thin and loosen the mucus, making it easier to cough up and clear from the airways.  Commonly treated conditions include:

* **Acute bronchitis:**  An inflammation of the bronchial tubes, often caused by bacterial infection and accompanied by excessive mucus.
* **Pneumonia (in some cases):**  While antibiotics are essential in pneumonia treatment, this combination might be used in milder cases or in conjunction with other therapies as directed by a physician.  It's crucial to remember that pneumonia often requires more comprehensive antibiotic treatment.
* **Sinusitis (certain types):**  If the sinusitis has a bacterial component, this combination may be considered to combat the infection and ease mucus congestion.  However,  viral sinusitis won't respond to antibiotics.


It's important to note that this combination is not suitable for all respiratory infections.  A doctor should always diagnose the condition and prescribe the appropriate medication.  Self-treating can be dangerous.


### Dosage

**Dosage information for Cefalexin + Bromhexine combination products is highly variable depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation.**  There is no standardized dosage for this combination across all brands. **Always consult the product label and/or your doctor for precise dosage instructions.**  The following is general information and should not be considered a prescription:

* **Oral:**  Dosage will depend on the specific drug concentration within the combined formulation, the age of the patient, and the severity of the infection. Typically, doses are adjusted to match the recommended Cefalexin and Bromhexine dosage based on established guidelines for each drug individually.
* **IV Administration:**  This combination is not typically administered intravenously. Cefalexin can be given intravenously, but Bromhexine is not.


**Children's Dosage:** Pediatric dosages of Cefalexin + Bromhexine combinations vary significantly.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on the child's weight and age.


**Important Note:** Never exceed the recommended dosage.  Follow the doctor's prescription and the instructions on the product label carefully.

### How it Works

Cefalexin works by interfering with the bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death and effectively combating the infection. Bromhexine reduces the viscosity of mucus, making it easier to expectorate, improving airway clearance, and aiding in the relief of respiratory symptoms.  The combination aims to treat both the bacterial infection and the mucus congestion associated with certain respiratory illnesses.
