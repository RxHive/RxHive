# Chymotrypsin
### Generic Name
Chymotrypsin

### Usage
Chymotrypsin is a proteolytic enzyme derived from bovine pancreas.  Its primary use is as an anti-inflammatory agent, particularly helpful in managing swelling and inflammation associated with abscesses, ulcers, surgical procedures, and traumatic injuries.  It's also used in ophthalmology to facilitate intracapsular cataract extraction by weakening the zonular fibers that hold the lens in place (enzymatic zonulysis).  Additionally, it finds application as an expectorant to help loosen and clear mucus in conditions like asthma, bronchitis, and sinusitis.  In burn patients, it may be used to mitigate the initial increase in serum liver enzyme levels, potentially reducing liver stress during wound healing.  Essentially, chymotrypsin aids in the breakdown of proteins and polypeptides, contributing to its various therapeutic effects.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration and the specific condition being treated.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions.

* **Anti-inflammatory (Oral):** Typically, 100,000 units are administered every six hours, half an hour before meals.
* **Anti-inflammatory (Intramuscular - IM):**  The usual dosage is 5,000 units, given 1 to 3 times daily.
* **Enzymatic Zonulysis (Intraocular):** For intracapsular lens extraction, 1-2 mL of a 1:5000 diluted solution (150 NF units/mL) is used to irrigate the posterior chamber.  This is followed by irrigation with at least 2 mL of the unused diluent 2-4 minutes after the procedure.

**Important Note:** Pediatric dosing information is not readily available in standard references and should be determined by a pediatrician or ophthalmologist based on the specific needs of the child and condition.  Weight-based adjustments may be necessary in certain cases.

### Side Effects
The frequency of side effects is not consistently defined in available literature.  However, the following have been reported:

* **Intramuscular injection:** Severe allergic reactions are a possibility.
* **Oral administration:** Allergic reactions (rare) and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., upset stomach) can occur.
* **Ophthalmological use:** Increased intraocular pressure, corneal edema (swelling), corneal striations (lines or streaks), and moderate uveitis (inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye) are potential complications.

Any significant or concerning side effects should be reported to a doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Chymotrypsin is a serine protease, meaning it's an enzyme that breaks down proteins by cleaving peptide bonds.  In its anti-inflammatory role, it likely reduces inflammation by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory process.  In ophthalmology, it selectively breaks down the zonular fibers that suspend the lens in the eye, making cataract surgery easier.  As an expectorant, it helps to break down mucus proteins, facilitating their removal from the respiratory tract.

### Precautions
Chymotrypsin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to chymotrypsin or any of its components.
* High vitreous pressure (pressure within the eye's vitreous humor).
* Gaping incisional wounds (open wounds).
* Congenital cataracts.
* Patients under 20 years old (due to potential lens-vitreous adhesion unresponsive to chymotrypsin).
* Severe hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.
* Peptic ulcers.


Caution should be exercised in patients with pre-existing conditions or those taking other medications.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and allergies before using chymotrypsin.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before using this medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take chymotrypsin with food?** A:  Generally, oral chymotrypsin can be taken with or without food.  However, it's advisable to follow your doctor's specific instructions.

* **Q: How should I store chymotrypsin?** A: Store chymotrypsin as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Is chymotrypsin safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use of chymotrypsin is not typically recommended without ongoing medical supervision.  Your doctor can assess the need for continued treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?** A:  While not extensively documented, the potential exists for interactions.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications and supplements you are taking.
