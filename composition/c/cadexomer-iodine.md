# Cadexomer Iodine

**Generic Name:** Cadexomer Iodine

**Usage:**

Cadexomer iodine is a topical antiseptic used for the treatment and management of:

* **Wound cleansing and debridement:** It helps to remove necrotic tissue (dead tissue) and bacteria from wounds, promoting healing.  It's effective on various wound types, including pressure ulcers, leg ulcers, burns (minor), and infected wounds.
* **Treatment of infected wounds:** Its antimicrobial properties help combat bacterial and fungal infections in wounds.


**Side Effects:**

Cadexomer iodine is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur, though they are usually mild and temporary. These include:

* **Local skin reactions:**  These can manifest as redness, itching, burning, or mild pain at the application site.  These are usually transient and resolve with discontinuation of the treatment.
* **Allergic reactions:** In rare cases, allergic reactions, ranging from mild skin rashes to more severe reactions like angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), can occur.  Individuals with known iodine allergies should avoid using this product.
* **Staining:** Cadexomer iodine can stain skin and clothing, though this is usually temporary and easily washable.
* **Rarely:** Reports of systemic iodine absorption leading to thyroid problems, particularly in individuals with pre-existing thyroid conditions, are extremely rare but should be considered.


**How it Works:**

Cadexomer iodine is a complex of iodine and a starch-based polymer (dextranomer).  It works through several mechanisms:

* **Antimicrobial activity:** Iodine is a potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that kills bacteria, fungi, and some viruses by disrupting their cellular function.  The slow release of iodine from the cadexomer iodine matrix provides sustained antimicrobial activity.
* **Wound debridement:** The complex absorbs wound exudate (fluid) and acts as a physical barrier, protecting the wound from further contamination.  The absorption of exudate helps to remove necrotic tissue, facilitating wound healing.
