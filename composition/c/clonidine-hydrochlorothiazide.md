# Clonidine + Hydrochlorothiazide

**Generic Name:** Clonidine Hydrochloride/Hydrochlorothiazide

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat mild to moderate hypertension (high blood pressure).  Clonidine lowers blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels, while hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that helps the body get rid of excess sodium and water, thus reducing blood volume and pressure.  It's typically prescribed when a single medication isn't sufficient to control blood pressure.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect of clonidine.
* **Dry mouth:**  Another frequent side effect of clonidine.
* **Dizziness:** Can be caused by both clonidine and hydrochlorothiazide.
* **Headache:**  A common side effect.
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling tired or weak.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty passing stools.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** Can lead to dizziness or fainting.
* **Electrolyte imbalance:** Hydrochlorothiazide can cause imbalances in potassium, sodium, and other electrolytes.
* **Increased urination:** Due to the diuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazide.
* **Dehydration:**  Especially if not drinking enough fluids.


More serious, but less common side effects include:

* **Bradycardia (slow heart rate):**  A significant slowing of the heart.
* **Depression:**  Changes in mood.
* **Liver problems:**  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).
* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms can range from rash to difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:**

* **Clonidine:**  This centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonist works by reducing the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for raising blood pressure.  It reduces the signals from the brain that cause blood vessels to constrict. This leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and reduced heart rate, lowering blood pressure.

* **Hydrochlorothiazide:** This thiazide diuretic works by increasing the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the kidneys.  This reduces blood volume, which in turn lowers blood pressure.

The combination of these two medications provides a synergistic effect, meaning their combined action is greater than the sum of their individual effects.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Alcohol can worsen the side effects of both clonidine and hydrochlorothiazide, particularly drowsiness and low blood pressure.  It's best to avoid alcohol or limit consumption significantly.

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping clonidine abruptly can lead to a rebound effect, causing a sudden and significant increase in blood pressure, potentially more dangerous than the original hypertension.  You should always taper off the medication under the supervision of your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: What are the potential interactions with other medications?** A:  Many medications can interact with clonidine and hydrochlorothiazide.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Q:  What are the symptoms of low blood pressure?** A: Dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, weakness, nausea.  If you experience these, lie down and contact your doctor immediately.
