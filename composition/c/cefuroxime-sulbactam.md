**How it Works:**

Cefuroxime is a cephalosporin antibiotic. It works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, leading to bacterial cell death.  Sulbactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by some bacteria that can break down cephalosporins, making them ineffective. Sulbactam prevents this breakdown, allowing cefuroxime to effectively kill the bacteria.  The combination of cefuroxime and sulbactam broadens the spectrum of bacteria the medication can effectively treat.
