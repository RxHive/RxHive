# Colloidal Bismuth Subcitrate
### Generic Name
Colloidal Bismuth Subcitrate

### Usage
Colloidal Bismuth Subcitrate is primarily used for the short-term treatment (generally no longer than 8 weeks) of gastric and duodenal ulcers.  It's also used off-label in combination with other medications for the eradication of *Helicobacter pylori*, a bacterium that commonly causes stomach ulcers and gastritis.  The medication works by creating a protective barrier over the ulcer, aiding in the healing process.  It's important to note that this medication is not intended for long-term use or as a maintenance therapy to prevent ulcer recurrence.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** The dosage varies depending on the condition being treated.  It's crucial to follow your doctor's specific instructions.

* **Duodenal and Gastric Ulcers:**  The typical dose is 300 mg (equivalent to 120 mg bismuth oxide) four times a day (QID), or 600 mg (equivalent to 240 mg bismuth oxide) twice a day (BID).  The maximum duration of treatment is two months.  Note that tablet strength may be expressed as bismuth subcitrate or the equivalent bismuth oxide.

* **_Helicobacter pylori_ Eradication (Off-Label Use):** Colloidal bismuth subcitrate is often part of a "quadruple therapy" regimen.  A common approach involves taking 300 mg (120 mg bismuth oxide equivalent) four times daily alongside a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), tetracycline, and metronidazole.  The treatment duration is typically 10-14 days.  The specific combination and dosage of these other medications will be determined by your physician.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Colloidal bismuth subcitrate is not recommended for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided in manufacturer's labeling for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. However, use with caution is advised.  Colloidal bismuth subcitrate is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.

### How it Works
Colloidal bismuth subcitrate works by increasing the secretion of mucus glycoproteins in the stomach. This increased mucus forms a protective layer over the ulcer, acting as a barrier against the damaging effects of stomach acid (HCl).  It also helps to accumulate epidermal growth factor around the ulcer, promoting healing.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Colloidal bismuth subcitrate should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to bismuth subcitrate or any of its components, or those with severe renal impairment.

* **Interactions:**  The absorption of colloidal bismuth subcitrate can be increased when used with antisecretory drugs, and this combination should generally be avoided.  Tetracycline absorption is reduced when taken with colloidal bismuth subcitrate, so concurrent use should also be avoided.

* **Warnings:**  High doses or prolonged use can lead to neurotoxicity.  Temporary darkening of the tongue and/or black stools is a common, generally reversible side effect.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid this medication.

* **General Considerations:**  Take the medication 30 minutes before meals and 2 hours after the last meal of the day, unless otherwise instructed by your doctor. Do not crush or chew the tablets.  Avoid consuming food, drink (especially antacids, milk, or calcium/iron-containing products) within 30 minutes of taking the medication.
