# Colloidal bismuth subcitrate

**Generic Name:** Colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS)

**Usage:**  Colloidal bismuth subcitrate is used to treat active *Helicobacter pylori* (H. pylori) infection, a bacterium that causes peptic ulcers and gastritis. It is typically used in combination with other antibiotics and/or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as part of a multi-drug regimen.  It's *not* used to treat the symptoms of ulcers directly, but to eradicate the infection causing them.

**Side Effects:** The most common side effects of colloidal bismuth subcitrate are generally mild and gastrointestinal in nature. These include:

* **Darkening of the stool:** This is a common and harmless side effect.
* **Black tongue:**  This is usually temporary and resolves once the medication is stopped.
* **Nausea:** Relatively common, but often resolves with continued use.
* **Constipation or diarrhea:** Can occur in some individuals.
* **Metallic taste in the mouth:** A characteristic side effect.


Less common but more serious side effects are rare, but should be reported to a doctor immediately. These might include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Kidney problems (changes in urine output, swelling)
* Neurological symptoms (confusion, seizures)

**How it Works:** The exact mechanism of action of colloidal bismuth subcitrate against H. pylori isn't completely understood, but it's believed to work in several ways:

* **Antibacterial activity:** CBS directly inhibits the growth of H. pylori bacteria.
* **Cytoprotective effects:**  It helps protect the lining of the stomach from damage by H. pylori and acid.
* **Anti-inflammatory effects:** It reduces inflammation in the stomach lining.
* **Bismuth binding:** CBS binds to H. pylori, making it easier for the immune system and other antibiotics to target and eliminate the bacteria.
