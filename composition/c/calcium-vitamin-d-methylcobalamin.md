# Calcium + Vitamin D + Methylcobalamin

**Generic Name:** Calcium (various salts like carbonate, citrate, gluconate), Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), Methylcobalamin

**Usage:**

This combination supplement is primarily used to address or prevent deficiencies in calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin).  Specific uses include:

* **Osteoporosis and Osteopenia:**  Calcium and vitamin D are crucial for bone health, preventing bone loss and reducing fracture risk.
* **Calcium Deficiency (Hypocalcemia):**  Supplementing with calcium addresses low calcium levels in the blood.
* **Vitamin D Deficiency (Hypovitaminosis D):**  Corrects low vitamin D levels, which can lead to various health problems, including weakened bones, muscle weakness, and increased risk of infections.
* **Vitamin B12 Deficiency (Cobalamin Deficiency):** Methylcobalamin is a form of vitamin B12 vital for nerve function, red blood cell production, and DNA synthesis. Deficiency can cause anemia, fatigue, nerve damage, and cognitive issues.
* **Post-menopausal women:** This combination is often prescribed to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects vary depending on the individual and the dosage, but can include:

* **Calcium:** Constipation, gas, bloating, nausea, kidney stones (especially with high doses and pre-existing kidney problems).
* **Vitamin D:**  Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, constipation, weakness, headache, dry mouth, metallic taste,  hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels - serious side effect requiring medical attention).
* **Methylcobalamin:**  Generally well-tolerated but can cause allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling) in rare cases.


**How it Works:**

* **Calcium:**  Builds and maintains strong bones and teeth.  It plays a role in muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.
* **Vitamin D:**  Helps the body absorb calcium from the gut. It also plays a role in immune function and cell growth.
* **Methylcobalamin:**  A crucial coenzyme involved in various metabolic processes, including nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis.
