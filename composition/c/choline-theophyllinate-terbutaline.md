# Choline Theophyllinate + Terbutaline

There is no established generic drug combination of Choline Theophyllinate and Terbutaline.  These are two distinct medications used for different, though sometimes overlapping, purposes.  Choline theophyllinate is a bronchodilator, while terbutaline is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist, also a bronchodilator, but with different mechanisms and uses.  They are *never* combined in a single generic preparation.

Therefore, providing details in the requested format would be misleading and inaccurate.  It's important to only use medications prescribed by a doctor and to consult them for any questions or concerns regarding medication.  Seeking information about a combination that doesn't exist could lead to dangerous self-medication.
