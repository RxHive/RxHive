# Cefixime + Ofloxacin

**Generic Name:** Cefixime + Ofloxacin

**Usage:** This combination antibiotic is typically prescribed for bacterial infections affecting various parts of the body, particularly those involving both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.  Specific infections treated may include:

* **Respiratory tract infections:** Bronchitis, pneumonia (depending on severity and causative agent).
* **Ear infections:** Otitis media (middle ear infection).
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** Cystitis, pyelonephritis (kidney infection).
* **Skin and soft tissue infections:** Abscesses, cellulitis.
* **Gonorrhea:**  (Although other treatments are often preferred as first-line therapy).


**Important Note:** This medication should ONLY be used as prescribed by a doctor.  Self-medicating with this combination can lead to antibiotic resistance and treatment failure. The specific usage depends entirely on the individual's diagnosis.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Common:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness.
* **Less Common:**  Yeast infections (vaginal or oral thrush), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), changes in taste, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight).
* **Serious (rare but require immediate medical attention):**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), seizures, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), colitis (inflammation of the colon), tendonitis (inflammation of tendons),  blood disorders.


**How it Works:**

Cefixime and Ofloxacin work synergistically, meaning they work better together than individually.

* **Cefixime:** This is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It works by interfering with the bacteria's ability to build cell walls, leading to bacterial death.  It is effective against a range of Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.

* **Ofloxacin:** This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It works by inhibiting an enzyme (DNA gyrase) essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair, leading to bacterial death.  It's effective against a broader range of bacteria than cefixime, including some that are resistant to other antibiotics.


The combination of these two antibiotics broadens the spectrum of bacterial infections they can effectively treat.


**FAQs:**
