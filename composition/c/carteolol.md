# Carteolol
### Generic Name
Carteolol

### Usage
Carteolol is primarily used to treat elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.  It's an ophthalmic solution, meaning it's applied directly to the eyes.  While its primary use focuses on eye conditions, it's crucial to remember that it's not suitable for all types of glaucoma (specifically, angle-closure glaucoma).

### Dosage
**Adults:** For elevated IOP in chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension, the typical dosage is one drop of a 1% carteolol ophthalmic solution in the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID).

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of carteolol in children have not been established, so it's not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance in such cases.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (affecting >10% of patients):**

* Ocular: Conjunctival hyperemia (redness), burning sensation, and epiphora (excessive tearing).

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Nervous System: Nightmares, tiredness.
* Cardiovascular: Bradycardia (slow heart rate), worsening of congestive heart failure.
* Ocular: Anisocoria (unequal pupil size), corneal punctate keratitis (inflammation of the cornea), corneal staining, decreased corneal sensitivity, eye pain, vision disturbances, blepharoconjunctivitis (inflammation of the eyelids and conjunctiva), photophobia (light sensitivity), ptosis (drooping eyelid).
* Respiratory: Asthma (exacerbation).
* Endocrine & Metabolic: Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).
* Genitourinary: Impotence.

**Important Note:** This list isn't exhaustive.  If you experience any adverse effects, even those not listed here, consult your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.


### How it Works
Carteolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. This means it blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors in the eye.  By doing so, it reduces the production of aqueous humor (the fluid inside the eye) and may also increase the outflow of this fluid.  This combined effect leads to a decrease in intraocular pressure, which is beneficial for managing glaucoma and ocular hypertension.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Carteolol is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to carteolol, other beta-blockers, or any ingredient in the formulation.
* Cardiogenic shock.
* Overt cardiac failure.
* Second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.
* Sinus bradycardia.
* Existing or history of bronchial asthma.
* Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

**Warnings:**  Carteolol should be used with caution in patients with:

* History of atopy or severe anaphylaxis.
* Diabetes mellitus (especially labile diabetes).
* Compensated heart failure.
* Myasthenia gravis.
* Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and Raynaud's disease.
* Bronchospastic disease.


**Drug Interactions:** Carteolol can interact with many other medications, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, alpha-/beta-agonists, alpha-1 blockers, alpha-2 agonists, aminoquinolines, antihypertensives, antipsychotics, barbiturates, beta-2 agonists, calcium-channel blockers, cardiac glycosides, cholinergic agonists, ergot derivatives, hypotensive drugs, insulin, MAOIs, NSAIDs, opioids, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, prostacyclin analogs, sulfonylureas, and theophylline derivatives.  These interactions can either enhance or diminish the effects of carteolol or the other medication.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Carteolol is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  The minimum effective dose should be used during pregnancy with punctal occlusion (to minimize systemic absorption).  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so use with caution while breastfeeding.


### FAQs

**Q: How should I store carteolol?**
A: Store carteolol at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: Can I use carteolol with contact lenses?**
A: Remove contact lenses before applying carteolol and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose.
