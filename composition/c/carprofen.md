# Carprofen
### Generic Name
Carprofen

### Usage
Carprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  While it was once available for human use, it's no longer marketed for this purpose.  Currently, its primary use is in veterinary medicine, specifically for dogs.  It's prescribed to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis.  Additionally, it's used to manage postoperative pain following soft tissue and orthopedic surgeries in canine patients.

### Dosage
Dosage of carprofen for dogs is determined by the veterinarian based on the dog's weight and the specific condition being treated. It's crucial to follow the veterinarian's instructions precisely.  The medication is typically administered orally, either as a tablet or a liquid suspension.  Dosage should never be adjusted without consulting the prescribing veterinarian.  There are no established dosages for human use as it is no longer prescribed for people.

### Side Effects
Common side effects in dogs may include:

* Loss of appetite
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Lethargy
* Increased thirst
* Increased urination
* Skin reactions

Less common but serious side effects can occur and may include gastrointestinal ulcers, kidney problems, and liver damage.  If any adverse effects are observed, it's imperative to contact a veterinarian immediately.


### How it Works
Carprofen works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes.  COX enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, carprofen helps to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.  It also demonstrates modulatory effects on both humoral and cellular immune responses, impacting the inflammatory process more comprehensively.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Carprofen should not be given to dogs with known hypersensitivity to carprofen or other NSAIDs.  It should also be avoided in dogs with pre-existing kidney or liver disease, bleeding disorders, or gastrointestinal ulcers.
* **Drug Interactions:** Carprofen can interact with other medications, including other NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants.  Always inform the veterinarian of all medications the dog is taking.
* **Warnings:**  Particular caution is advised in older dogs, puppies, and dogs with underlying health conditions.  Pregnant or lactating dogs should only receive carprofen under strict veterinary supervision.
* **Safety:**  Always store carprofen out of reach of children and other animals.  Never exceed the prescribed dosage.
