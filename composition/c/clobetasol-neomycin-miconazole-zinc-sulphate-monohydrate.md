# Clobetasol + Neomycin + Miconazole + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate

**Generic Name:** Clobetasol Propionate + Neomycin Sulfate + Miconazole Nitrate + Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid, antibiotic, antifungal, and astringent used to treat various skin conditions that involve inflammation, bacterial infection, and fungal infection simultaneously.  Specific uses might include:

* **Seborrheic dermatitis:** A common skin condition causing scaly, itchy patches.
* **Eczema (atopic dermatitis):**  Inflammation and itching of the skin.
* **Psoriasis:** A chronic skin condition causing raised, red, scaly patches.
* **Infected eczema or psoriasis:** When these conditions are complicated by bacterial or fungal infections.
* **Other inflammatory skin conditions:**  Where bacterial or fungal superinfection is suspected or present.

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list, and the specific usage should always be determined by a doctor.  Self-treating can be harmful.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the duration of use.  Common side effects include:

* **Burning, stinging, or itching at the application site.**
* **Skin thinning (atrophy).**
* **Stretch marks (striae).**
* **Skin discoloration (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation).**
* **Increased hair growth (hypertrichosis).**
* **Acne-like rash.**
* **Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).**
* **Secondary infections (if not used correctly).**

Prolonged use or use on large areas of skin can increase the risk of more severe side effects.  Systemic absorption of corticosteroids can occur with prolonged use, leading to more widespread side effects.  Neomycin can cause allergic reactions, particularly in individuals with a history of allergy to neomycin or other aminoglycoside antibiotics.

**How it Works:**

* **Clobetasol Propionate:** A potent corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response in the skin.
* **Neomycin Sulfate:** An antibiotic that kills bacteria, preventing or treating bacterial skin infections.
* **Miconazole Nitrate:** An antifungal agent that kills fungi, preventing or treating fungal skin infections.
* **Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate:** An astringent that helps to dry the skin, reduce inflammation, and promote healing.

The combination of these four active ingredients provides a multi-pronged approach to treating skin conditions with inflammation, bacterial, and fungal components.
