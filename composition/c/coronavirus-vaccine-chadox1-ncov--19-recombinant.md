# CoronaVirus Vaccine  ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19 (Recombinant)
### Generic Name
Coronavirus Vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Recombinant) (Covishield)

### Usage
Coronavirus Vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Recombinant), also known as Covishield, is a vaccine used to actively immunize individuals aged 18 years and older against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  Its primary use is to prevent infection and reduce the severity of COVID-19.  There are no notable secondary uses beyond this primary preventative function.

### Dosage
**Adults (≥18 years):**  The recommended dosage is two separate intramuscular (IM) injections of 0.5 ml each.  The second dose should be administered between 4 and 16 weeks after the first, depending on vaccine availability and individual needs.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of this vaccine have not yet been established in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) may have a weaker immune response.  Those with decompensated cirrhosis should be prioritized for vaccination due to their increased risk of severe COVID-19.
* **Renal Impairment:** Patients with kidney disease should also be prioritized for vaccination.  However, their immune response may be weaker, and highly potent vaccines might be preferred.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of recipients) include:

* Injection-site tenderness
* Injection-site pain
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Muscle pain (myalgia)
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Fever (pyrexia), including feverishness
* Chills
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Nausea

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects may occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms after vaccination.

### How it Works
Covishield is a viral vector vaccine. It uses a weakened, replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1) as a vector to deliver the genetic instructions for the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein into the body's cells. The cells then produce the S protein, triggering an immune response. This response generates antibodies and T cells that recognize and fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus if encountered later.  This helps protect against COVID-19 infection.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to Covishield or any of its components.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Hypersensitivity Reactions:** There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Thrombocytopenia and Coagulation Disorders:** Use with caution in patients with these conditions due to the risk of bleeding or bruising following injection.
* **Immunocompromised Individuals:**  The immune response may be weaker in immunocompromised individuals.
* **Pregnancy:**  Use only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the mother and fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Excretion in breast milk is unknown; the potential risk to infants cannot be excluded. The benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed against the mother's need for vaccination.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for the vaccine to be effective?**  A:  Full immunity typically develops several weeks after the second dose.
* **Q: Can I get COVID-19 from the vaccine?** A: No, the vaccine cannot cause COVID-19.  It uses a weakened virus that cannot replicate and cause illness.
* **Q: How should I store the vaccine?** A:  Store according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Typically, this involves refrigeration between +2°C and +8°C.  Multi-dose vials should be used within 6 hours of opening.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Most side effects are mild and temporary. If you have any concerns, contact your healthcare provider.  Severe or unusual reactions require immediate medical attention.
* **Q: Should I get vaccinated if I've already had COVID-19?** A: Yes, it's recommended to complete the vaccination schedule regardless of prior infection to ensure a strong and long-lasting immune response.
