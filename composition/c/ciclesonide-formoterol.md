# Ciclesonide + Formoterol

**Generic Name:** Ciclesonide/Formoterol

**Usage:**

Ciclesonide/Formoterol is a combination inhaler used to prevent and treat symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and asthma.  It's prescribed for patients who require both a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for long-term control of their condition.  It's not for quick relief of symptoms â€“ a separate rescue inhaler (like albuterol) is needed for that purpose.  The specific dosage and frequency will be determined by a physician based on individual needs and response.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects may include:

* **Throat irritation:** This is often mild and temporary.
* **Headache:**  Can be mild to moderate in severity.
* **Muscle aches:**  Generally mild and transient.
* **Thrush (oral candidiasis):**  A fungal infection of the mouth, more likely with prolonged use.  Rinsing the mouth after each use can help prevent this.
* **Voice changes (hoarseness):** Can occur due to the deposition of medication in the throat.
* **Nausea:** Though less common.


Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* **Increased risk of pneumonia:**  Especially in patients with COPD.
* **Paradoxically increased bronchospasm:**  A sudden tightening of the airways. This is rare but warrants immediate medical attention.
* **Fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations):**  Usually due to the formoterol component.
* **Tremors:** Usually mild.
* **Increased blood sugar:** Especially in patients with diabetes.


**How it Works:**

This combination inhaler contains two active ingredients:

* **Ciclesonide (ICS):** This is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the airways.  Inflammation is a key component in both asthma and COPD, causing airway narrowing and increased mucus production.  By reducing inflammation, ciclesonide helps to prevent symptoms.

* **Formoterol (LABA):** This is a long-acting beta2-agonist that relaxes the muscles around the airways, making it easier to breathe. It provides long-lasting bronchodilation, opening up the airways.

The combination of these two medications provides both anti-inflammatory and bronchodilating effects, offering better control of symptoms than either medication alone for many patients.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I use this inhaler for quick relief of symptoms?** A: No, this is a preventative medication.  Use a separate rescue inhaler (like albuterol) for sudden shortness of breath or wheezing.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The bronchodilating effects of formoterol are usually felt relatively quickly, while the anti-inflammatory effects of ciclesonide take longer to develop (usually days to weeks).

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q:  Can I use this inhaler if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: Discuss this with your doctor.  The risks and benefits need to be carefully weighed.

* **Q:  What are the interactions with other medications?** A: Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as there may be interactions.

* **Q:  How should I store my inhaler?** A: Store as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and extreme heat.
