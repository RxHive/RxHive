# Cefixime + Azithromycin
### Generic Name
Cefixime + Azithromycin


### Usage

Cefixime and Azithromycin is a combination antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections.  It's particularly effective against infections affecting the respiratory tract (like bronchitis, pneumonia), ears (otitis media), skin, and urinary tract.  The combination leverages the strengths of both antibiotics: Cefixime, a third-generation cephalosporin, is effective against a broad range of Gram-negative bacteria, while Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, targets Gram-positive bacteria and some atypical pathogens that may be resistant to other antibiotics.  This combination therapy is often prescribed when a doctor suspects a mixed infection involving both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, it's crucial to understand that this combination should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  It is not a treatment for viral infections, such as the common cold or influenza.


### Dosage

Dosage of Cefixime and Azithromycin varies significantly depending on the patient's age, weight, the specific infection being treated, and the severity of the infection.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage provided by a doctor precisely.  There's no standard "one-size-fits-all" dosage.

**Important Note:**  The information below is for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered a prescription.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.  This combination is usually not available as a pre-mixed formulation; instead, Cefixime and Azithromycin are often prescribed as separate medications.

* **Cefixime:**  Dosage for adults typically ranges from 200mg to 400mg once or twice daily, depending on the infection. Pediatric dosages are significantly lower and calculated based on weight.  It's commonly administered orally as a capsule or tablet.

* **Azithromycin:**  Dosage for adults is usually a single dose of 1 gram or 500mg daily for 3-5 days. Pediatric dosages depend on weight and the specific infection. It is usually administered orally as tablets, capsules, or a suspension.

**Intravenous Administration:**  While Azithromycin has an intravenous formulation, Cefixime does not.  Therefore, IV administration of this combination is not possible.

**Administration Guidelines:**  Take Cefixime and Azithromycin with a full glass of water, preferably on an empty stomach (at least one hour before or two hours after meals) for better absorption.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash
* Vaginal yeast infection (in women)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) - Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) – severe diarrhea that may indicate a serious gut infection.
* Liver damage (hepatitis) – characterized by jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, and fatigue.
* Seizures (rare)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Cefixime and Azithromycin work by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.  Cefixime, a cephalosporin, targets bacterial cell wall synthesis, preventing the bacteria from building and maintaining their protective outer layer, ultimately leading to bacterial death.  Azithromycin, a macrolide, binds to the bacterial ribosome, the protein synthesis machinery within the bacteria. This binding prevents the ribosome from functioning correctly, halting the production of essential bacterial proteins, ultimately leading to bacterial death.  By using both drugs simultaneously, the potential for bacterial resistance is reduced, and broader antimicrobial coverage is achieved.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Individuals with known allergies to cephalosporins, macrolides, or any other components of the medications should not take this combination.  Inform your doctor about any allergies before starting treatment.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This combination can interact with certain medications, such as anticoagulants (blood thinners), certain antacids, and other antibiotics.  Disclose all medications you are taking to your doctor.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of Cefixime and Azithromycin during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Always consult your doctor.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:**  Individuals with liver or kidney problems require careful monitoring while taking this combination due to the potential for increased side effects.
* **Alcohol Consumption:**  Avoid alcohol consumption while on this medication, as it can worsen side effects.
* **Children:**  The dosage for children is carefully determined based on their weight and the specific infection.

This combination should always be prescribed and monitored by a healthcare professional.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication once I feel better?**  A: No, it's essential to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better.  Stopping early can lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store Cefixime and Azithromycin as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Is this medication suitable for everyone?** A: No, it is crucial to consult your doctor to determine if this combination is appropriate for your specific health condition and medical history.  

* **Q:  What if I experience severe side effects?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe allergic reactions, severe diarrhea, or any other significant adverse effects.
