# Cefalexin + Probenecid
### Generic Name
Cefalexin + Probenecid


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by bacteria susceptible to cefalexin.  Cefalexin is a cephalosporin antibiotic that effectively combats a wide range of bacterial infections. Probenecid, on the other hand, works by blocking the kidneys' reabsorption of cefalexin.  This means more cefalexin stays in the bloodstream for a longer duration, leading to a higher concentration in the urine.  This increased concentration is crucial for effectively treating UTIs, as it ensures the bacteria in the urinary tract are exposed to sufficient levels of the antibiotic to be eliminated. While the primary use is for UTIs,  this combination may be considered in other infections where prolonged high concentrations of cefalexin in the urine are deemed beneficial by a physician.  It's crucial to remember that this combination should only be used under strict medical supervision and is not a first-line treatment for all UTIs.


### Dosage

Dosage of cefalexin and probenecid in combination should always be determined by a physician based on individual needs and the severity of the infection.  There isn't a standardized, universally recommended dose for this specific combination.  The doctor will prescribe the appropriate amounts of both cefalexin and probenecid, considering factors like the patient's age, weight, kidney function, and the type of infection. 

The usual dosage of cefalexin alone ranges from 250mg to 1 gram four times a day, depending on the severity of the infection. The dose of probenecid usually accompanies the cefalexin, and ranges from 500mg to 1 gram per day.

**Important Note:**  This information is for general knowledge only.  Never attempt to self-medicate or adjust dosages without explicit guidance from a healthcare professional.  Dosage forms may vary (e.g., tablets, capsules) and administration routes (oral) should be followed strictly as prescribed.  Pediatric dosage for this specific combination needs to be determined by the physician, considering the child's age, weight, and overall health.  IV administration of this combination is typically not used; cefalexin may be given IV separately for severe infections, but it would be under different protocols without probenecid.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of cefalexin alone include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Rash
* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild skin reactions to severe anaphylaxis)
*  Pseudomembranous colitis (a serious bowel infection)

Probenecid can cause:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash
* Kidney stones (less common but serious)

Serious, but less common side effects related to either drug require immediate medical attention.  Consult a doctor immediately if you experience severe allergic reactions (difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat), severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, or any other unusual or worsening symptoms.  


### How it Works

Cefalexin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis. This means it prevents bacteria from building and maintaining their protective outer walls, eventually leading to their death.  Probenecid inhibits the tubular secretion of cefalexin in the kidneys.  This means that less of the cefalexin is removed from the bloodstream by the kidneys and more remains available to fight the infection.  By increasing the concentration and duration of cefalexin in the body, especially in the urine,  the combination improves the effectiveness of cefalexin in treating UTIs.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Individuals with known allergies to cephalosporin antibiotics or probenecid should avoid this combination.  Inform your doctor about all allergies before starting treatment.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Both cefalexin and probenecid are eliminated through the kidneys.  Individuals with impaired kidney function may require dose adjustments or alternative treatment options to avoid potential toxicity.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Probenecid can interact with several drugs, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), methotrexate, and other medications metabolized by the kidneys.  Itâ€™s vital to inform your doctor of all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies being taken.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Consult your doctor for guidance.
* **Alcohol:** While there aren't direct interactions, alcohol consumption should be avoided or limited while on antibiotics due to possible gastrointestinal upset.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication with alcohol?** A:  It is best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication as it may worsen side effects like nausea and stomach upset.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A:  Store the medication at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication once I feel better?** A:  No.  Continue taking the medication for the full prescribed course, even if you feel better, to ensure complete eradication of the infection and prevent recurrence.  Stopping early can lead to antibiotic resistance.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Mild side effects often resolve on their own. However, if you experience severe or persistent side effects, contact your doctor immediately.
