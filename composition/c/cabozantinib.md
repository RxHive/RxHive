**How it Works:**

Cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by blocking the activity of certain enzymes called tyrosine kinases, which are involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. Specifically, it targets several receptors, including MET, AXL, and VEGFR, which are often overactive in various types of cancer. By inhibiting these receptors, cabozantinib can help slow or stop the growth and spread of cancer cells.
