# Cabozantinib
### Generic Name
Cabozantinib

### Usage

Cabozantinib is a targeted cancer therapy, specifically a kinase inhibitor.  Its primary use is in treating several types of advanced cancers that have not responded well to other treatments, or as a first-line treatment in combination with other medications.  These cancers include:

* **Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC):** Cabozantinib is used both as a monotherapy (single drug treatment) and in combination with nivolumab (another cancer drug) for treating advanced RCC.  It's approved for both first-line (initial) and later-line treatment depending on the specific regimen.

* **Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC):** Cabozantinib is used to treat HCC that has progressed after treatment with sorafenib, another targeted therapy.

* **Progressive, Metastatic Medullary Thyroid Cancer:** Cabozantinib is indicated for treating this type of thyroid cancer that has spread.

* **Locally Advanced or Metastatic Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC):** This use is for adult and pediatric patients (12 years and older) whose DTC has progressed after previous treatments with VEGFR-targeted therapies and who are either refractory (non-responsive) to radioactive iodine or ineligible for it.


### Dosage

Cabozantinib comes in both tablet and capsule forms, which are *not* interchangeable.  Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific cancer being treated and whether it's used alone or in combination with other drugs.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage and instructions meticulously.

* **Differentiated Thyroid Cancer:**
    * Adults and pediatric patients (≥12 years) with Body Surface Area (BSA) ≥ 1.2 m²: Cabozantinib tablets: 60 mg once daily.
    * Pediatric patients (≥12 years) with BSA < 1.2 m²: Cabozantinib tablets: 40 mg once daily.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage may need to be adjusted based on factors like liver and kidney function, other medications being taken, and side effects experienced.  Your doctor will closely monitor you and make adjustments as needed.

### How it Works

Cabozantinib is a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor.  Kinases are enzymes that play a crucial role in cell growth and division.  Many cancer cells have abnormal kinase activity, leading to uncontrolled growth.  Cabozantinib works by blocking the activity of several specific kinases, including those involved in tumor growth, blood vessel formation (angiogenesis), and the spread of cancer (metastasis).  By inhibiting these kinases, Cabozantinib helps slow or stop the growth and spread of cancer cells.


### Precautions

* **Liver and Kidney Function:** Cabozantinib can affect liver and kidney function.  Regular monitoring is essential. Dosage adjustments might be necessary for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.

* **Drug Interactions:** Cabozantinib can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Grapefruit and St. John's Wort should be avoided.  Adjustments in dosage may be needed when taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Cabozantinib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for several months after. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for several months after.

* **Surgery:** Cabozantinib should be withheld for at least three weeks before scheduled surgery and for at least two weeks after major surgery.
