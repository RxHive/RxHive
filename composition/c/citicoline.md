# Citicoline
### Generic Name
Citicoline

### Usage
Citicoline, also known as cytidine diphosphate-choline (CDP-choline) or cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine, is a compound used primarily to support cognitive function and improve neurological conditions. While not approved for all uses in every country, it's investigated and sometimes used off-label for several conditions including:

* **Multi-infarct dementia:**  Citicoline is sometimes used to help manage the cognitive decline associated with this type of dementia, which is caused by multiple strokes.
* **Parkinson's Disease:** Often used in conjunction with levodopa, a standard Parkinson's medication, to potentially enhance its effects and improve motor skills.
* **Stroke Sequelae:** Used to aid recovery after a stroke, potentially helping to improve neurological function and reduce impairments.


It's crucial to remember that the use of citicoline for these conditions is often off-label, meaning it's used for purposes not specifically approved by regulatory bodies in all regions.  Always consult a healthcare professional to determine if citicoline is appropriate for your specific needs and medical history.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration (oral, intravenous, or intramuscular), and the individual patient.  The following are examples and should *not* be considered a prescription.  **Always follow your doctor's instructions.**

**Adults:**

* **Multi-infarct dementia (off-label):**  Oral: 1000 mg once daily, preferably in the morning.
* **Parkinson's Disease (off-label, with levodopa):** Oral: 400 mg three times daily. Intramuscular: 500-1000 mg once daily or as a divided dose, for 10-30 days.
* **Stroke sequelae (off-label):** Oral: 100-800 mg once daily. Intravenous: 250-1000 mg per day diluted in 5% dextrose.


**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of citicoline in children have not been established. It should not be administered to children unless specifically directed by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dose adjustments are provided for hepatic or renal impairment in the manufacturer's labeling.  However, caution is advised in patients with liver or kidney disease.

### Side Effects

Common side effects, though not always reported with defined frequency, may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach pain
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Rash
* Insomnia
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* In rare cases:  Convulsions (seizures)


Serious side effects are less common.  If you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above, immediately contact your doctor or seek medical attention.

### How it Works

Citicoline works by increasing the availability of choline, a crucial component in the synthesis of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter vital for memory, learning, and muscle control.  It also contributes to the maintenance of cell membranes, particularly in brain cells, potentially protecting them from damage caused by conditions such as stroke.  Additionally, citicoline may help to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Citicoline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to citicoline or any component of the formulation.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of citicoline during pregnancy and lactation is unknown. It's generally recommended to avoid use during these periods unless specifically prescribed by a physician who carefully weighs the benefits and risks.
* **Hypotension:**  Citicoline may increase the risk of low blood pressure.  Individuals with pre-existing hypotension should use it with caution and close monitoring.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While major interactions are not extensively documented, it is best to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to avoid potential unforeseen interactions.

### FAQs

* **Can I take citicoline with food?** Citicoline can be taken with or without food.
* **How should citicoline be stored?** Store citicoline as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and light.
* **Is citicoline safe for long-term use?** Long-term safety data is limited.  Discuss long-term use with your doctor to assess benefits and risks.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Can I stop taking citicoline suddenly?** It's best to follow your doctor's advice regarding stopping citicoline.  Sudden cessation might not be advisable.
