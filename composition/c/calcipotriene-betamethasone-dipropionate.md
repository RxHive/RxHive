# Calcipotriene + Betamethasone Dipropionate
### Generic Name
Calcipotriene + Betamethasone Dipropionate

### Usage
Calcipotriene + Betamethasone Dipropionate is a topical combination medication primarily used to treat plaque psoriasis.  It combines the actions of calcipotriene, a vitamin D analog, and betamethasone dipropionate, a corticosteroid, to effectively manage the symptoms of this skin condition.  This combination therapy targets both the inflammation and cell growth associated with psoriasis.  While primarily for plaque psoriasis, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the formulation (ointment, suspension, or foam) and the area being treated.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.

**Adults:**

* **Plaque Psoriasis:**  The medication is typically applied once daily to affected areas. The maximum amount should not exceed 100 grams per week. Treatment duration is usually up to 8 weeks for the suspension (scalp and body) and up to 4 weeks for the ointment and foam. Discontinue treatment if the lesion clears before the prescribed duration.

**Children:**

* **Plaque Psoriasis of the Scalp (Ages 12-17):**  The topical medication can be applied once daily to affected areas for up to 8 weeks, but treatment may be stopped sooner if the psoriasis clears. The maximum amount should not exceed 60 grams per week.  
* **Children under 12 years old:** The safety and effectiveness of this medication have not been established in this age group.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Consult a doctor if you have concerns about kidney or liver function.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of users) may include:

* Pruritus (itching)
* Worsening of psoriasis
* Skin atrophy (thinning of the skin)
* Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles)
* Burning sensation
* Skin depigmentation (loss of skin color)
* Ecchymosis (bruising)

Less common but more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, seek medical attention immediately.


### How it Works
Calcipotriene, a vitamin D analog, helps regulate the growth and differentiation of skin cells, reducing the rapid cell turnover characteristic of psoriasis. Betamethasone dipropionate, a corticosteroid, possesses anti-inflammatory and antipruritic (anti-itch) properties, reducing inflammation and relieving associated itching.  Together, these two active ingredients work synergistically to control the symptoms of plaque psoriasis.

This medication can interact with various medications, including aluminum hydroxide, bile acid sequestrants, calcium salts, cardiac glycosides, danazol, mineral oil, multivitamins with ADE or ADEK, orlistat, sucralfate, thiazide diuretics, and other vitamin D analogs.  It can also interact with certain medications containing corticosteroids, such as ceritinib, corticorelin, deferasirox, and hyaluronidase.
