# Cetirizine

**Generic Name:** Cetirizine

**Usage:** Cetirizine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies.  These symptoms include:

* Sneezing
* Runny nose
* Itchy, watery eyes
* Itchy throat or nose
* Hives (urticaria)
* Itching
* Skin rash

It's also used to relieve itching associated with hives and chronic idiopathic urticaria.  Some formulations are also used to treat symptoms of the common cold.  Always follow your doctor's instructions or the label directions.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, cetirizine can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* Drowsiness (this is more common with higher doses)
* Dry mouth
* Tiredness
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Stomach pain
* Diarrhea
* Sore throat

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention.  These include:

* Difficulty breathing or swallowing
* Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat
* Fast heartbeat
* Seizures


**How it Works:** Cetirizine is a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  By blocking histamine, cetirizine reduces the symptoms associated with allergies.
