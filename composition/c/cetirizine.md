# Cetirizine
### Generic Name
Cetirizine

### Usage
Cetirizine is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergies.  This includes both seasonal allergies (hay fever) and perennial allergies (allergies that occur year-round).  These symptoms can manifest as sneezing, runny nose, itchy or watery eyes, and itching of the nose and throat.  Cetirizine is an antihistamine, meaning it works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body in response to allergens.  While its primary use is for allergic rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages due to allergies), it's sometimes used to alleviate hives (urticaria), a skin condition characterized by itchy welts.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the individual's age and the formulation of the medication (tablet, syrup, or solution for injection - though injection is less common for cetirizine). Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions precisely.

**Adults and Children (6 years and older):**

* **Oral Tablets/Syrup:** The usual dose is 5-10 mg once daily.  Ten mg is often prescribed for more severe symptoms.
* **Oral Solution:**  Dosage will vary depending on the concentration; follow the package instructions closely.
* **Intravenous (IV):** IV administration of cetirizine is less common and usually reserved for specific circumstances under the close supervision of a medical professional. Dosage will be determined by the healthcare provider based on the individual's needs.

**Children (2-6 years):**

* **Oral Syrup/Solution:** Dosage is typically lower than for adults.  Specific dosing instructions are always provided on the packaging, but a healthcare provider should be consulted to determine the appropriate dose for your child.

**Children under 2 years:**  Cetirizine is generally not recommended for children under two years of age unless specifically prescribed by a doctor.

**Important Note:**  Never exceed the recommended dose. If symptoms persist or worsen, contact a healthcare professional.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of cetirizine are generally mild and may include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Stomach upset

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Fast heartbeat
* Seizures

If you experience any serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Cetirizine is a non-sedating antihistamine, meaning it effectively blocks histamine's action while producing less drowsiness than some older antihistamines. Histamine is a chemical released by the body in response to allergens.  It triggers the inflammatory response that causes allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.  Cetirizine works by competitively binding to histamine H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and triggering these symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using cetirizine if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Individuals with kidney problems may require a dose adjustment. Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on your kidney function.
* **Interactions with Other Drugs:** Cetirizine may interact with certain medications, including some sedatives and alcohol. Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all the medications you are taking.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking cetirizine as it may increase drowsiness.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Be cautious when driving or operating machinery, as drowsiness may occur, especially after the initial doses.
