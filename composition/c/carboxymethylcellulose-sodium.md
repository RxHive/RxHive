# Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium
### Generic Name
Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium

### Usage
Carboxymethylcellulose sodium is a common ingredient in eye drops used to provide temporary relief from dryness, burning, irritation, and discomfort in the eyes.  These symptoms can be caused by various factors, including environmental conditions like wind or sun exposure, or simply from naturally dry eyes. It's primarily used as a lubricant to supplement the eye's natural tear film and improve comfort.  While not a treatment for underlying eye conditions, it helps manage the symptoms associated with dryness.

### Dosage
The typical dosage for adults and children is one drop of the carboxymethylcellulose sodium eye lubricant into the affected eye(s) as needed for relief.  There aren't usually specific dosage adjustments based on age or weight, but always follow the instructions provided on the product label.  If symptoms persist or worsen, consult a healthcare professional.  The medication is typically administered as eye drops.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and infrequent. They might include:

* Temporary blurred vision immediately after application.
* Mild stinging or burning sensation upon instillation.

Serious side effects are rare.  However, if you experience any prolonged or worsening eye irritation, redness, pain, vision changes, or allergic reactions (such as swelling, itching, or rash), discontinue use and consult your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.


### How it Works
Carboxymethylcellulose sodium works by increasing the viscosity (thickness) of the tear film on the surface of the eye.  This helps to retain moisture on the eye's surface for a longer period, providing lubrication and relief from dryness and irritation. It acts as an artificial tear substitute, supplementing the body's natural lubricating mechanisms.
