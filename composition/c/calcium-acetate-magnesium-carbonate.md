# Calcium Acetate + Magnesium Carbonate
### Generic Name
Calcium Acetate + Magnesium Carbonate

### Usage

Calcium acetate and magnesium carbonate is a fixed-dose combination medication primarily used to treat hyperphosphatemia.  Hyperphosphatemia is a condition where there's too much phosphate in the blood. This is a common problem in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those undergoing dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis).  The medication works by binding to phosphate in the digestive tract, preventing its absorption into the bloodstream and promoting its excretion in the stool.  This helps to lower elevated phosphate levels and manage the complications associated with hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients.


### Dosage

**Adults (Hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on dialysis):** The usual starting dose is 3 tablets per day, taken with meals.  Each tablet contains 435 mg of calcium acetate and 235 mg of magnesium carbonate. The daily dose can be increased to a maximum of 12 tablets per day, divided among meals, depending on the patient's blood phosphate levels and response to treatment.  Dosage adjustments are typically guided by regular monitoring of phosphate levels.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of this combination have not been established in children and adolescents under 18.  Therefore, it's not recommended for this age group.

**Dosage Forms:**  This medication is typically available as tablets.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and administration instructions carefully.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Soft stools
* Gastrointestinal (GI) irritation (nausea, anorexia, feeling full, belching, constipation, diarrhea)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels)
* Hypermagnesemia (high blood magnesium levels)
* Hyperkalemia (high blood potassium levels)
* Magnesium-induced bone mineralization disturbances


If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Calcium acetate and magnesium carbonate are phosphate binders.  They work in the intestines by binding to phosphate from food. This prevents the phosphate from being absorbed into the bloodstream. The resulting phosphate-bound compounds are then eliminated from the body through the stool.  By reducing phosphate absorption, this medication helps to lower the level of phosphate in the blood, thereby managing hyperphosphatemia.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to calcium acetate or magnesium carbonate, increased parathyroid gland activity, hypercalciuria (high calcium in urine), dehydration, incomplete bowel movements, diarrhea, hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), hypophosphatemia (low blood phosphate), elevated serum magnesium levels, third-degree AV block, or myasthenia gravis.
* **Interactions:** This medication may interact with other medications, including certain statins (like atorvastatin), aspirin, probiotics, inhalers (like fluticasone and salmeterol), montelukast, omega-3 fatty acids, and others.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  This combination should be avoided during pregnancy unless the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is not recommended while using this medication.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly individuals may be more susceptible to side effects, particularly those related to calcium and magnesium levels.  Careful monitoring is essential.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Although no specific dosage adjustments are recommended, close monitoring of blood levels of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate is necessary due to the medication's impact on mineral metabolism.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I crush or chew the tablets?** A: No. The tablets should be swallowed whole with liquid. Crushing or chewing them can alter the medication's effect and may lead to an unpleasant taste.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep out of the reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I take antacids while using this medication?** A:  It's best to avoid taking antacids containing calcium or magnesium while on this medication, as it can increase your calcium and magnesium intake.  Consult your doctor.

* **Q: How long will I need to take this medication?** A: The duration of treatment depends on individual needs and response to therapy. Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment course.
