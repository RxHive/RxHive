# Chloramphenicol + Hydrocortisone
### Generic Name
Chloramphenicol + Hydrocortisone


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat bacterial infections of the eye, particularly those involving the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye) and cornea (the transparent front part of the eye).  It's particularly helpful in situations where both bacterial infection and inflammation are present.  Chloramphenicol, an antibiotic, targets and kills susceptible bacteria, while hydrocortisone, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation and swelling.  The combined action provides effective relief from both the infection and its associated symptoms.  This medication is specifically formulated for ophthalmic (eye) use and should not be used for any other purpose.


### Dosage

Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional and will vary depending on the severity of the infection and the patient's individual needs.  Generally, the medication is administered as eye drops or ointment.  

* **Adults and Children:** The typical dosage involves instilling one or two drops or a small amount of ointment into the affected eye(s) every 2-4 hours, or as directed by a doctor.  The exact frequency depends on the response to treatment.  It is crucial to follow the prescribed regimen closely.  Do not exceed the recommended dosage.

* **Oral or IV Administration:** This specific combination of Chloramphenicol and Hydrocortisone is **not** for oral or intravenous (IV) use.  Oral and IV formulations of chloramphenicol and hydrocortisone exist separately and are used to treat different conditions, with specific dosage guidelines.  Never use this ophthalmic preparation in any way other than as directed for eye application.

* **Specific Instructions:**  When applying eye drops, gently pull down the lower eyelid to form a pocket and instill the drops. After application, gently close your eyes for a few minutes.  When using the ointment, apply a thin ribbon along the inner lining of the lower eyelid.  Avoid touching the tip of the container to any surface to prevent contamination.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Burning or stinging sensation upon application, temporary blurred vision, mild discomfort.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (itching, swelling, rash), increased intraocular pressure (glaucoma), secondary infections (due to suppression of normal eye flora), delayed wound healing.  Vision changes beyond temporary blurring warrant immediate medical attention.
* **Rare but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**  Systemic absorption of chloramphenicol (though rare with topical application) can lead to serious blood disorders (aplastic anemia, gray baby syndrome), and hydrocortisone can elevate blood sugar levels.


If you experience any side effects, particularly unusual or severe ones, consult your ophthalmologist or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Chloramphenicol inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, preventing the bacteria from multiplying and ultimately leading to their death. This effectively combats the infection. Hydrocortisone reduces inflammation by suppressing the body's inflammatory response.  The combined effect provides both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory action, promoting healing and reducing discomfort associated with eye infections.
