# Cysteamine (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Cysteamine (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Cysteamine ophthalmic solution is a medication used to treat corneal cystine crystal deposits in patients with cystinosis, both adults and children.  Cystinosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes cystine crystals to build up in various parts of the body, including the cornea (the clear front part of the eye).  These crystals can lead to vision problems. Cysteamine works to reduce the buildup of these cystine crystals in the cornea, thereby improving vision.  This medication is specifically for eye application and does not treat other symptoms associated with cystinosis.

### Dosage

The dosage of cysteamine ophthalmic solution varies depending on the concentration of the solution:

* **0.37% Solution:**  One drop in each eye four times daily during waking hours for both adults and children.
* **0.44% Solution:** One drop in each eye every hour during waking hours for both adults and children.

**Important Administration Instructions:**  Wash hands before using the medication. Avoid touching the dropper tip to the eye or any other surface to prevent contamination.  If using other ophthalmic medications, separate their administration by at least 10 minutes; apply eye ointments last. Remove contact lenses before instillation and wait 15 minutes before reinserting them.  If a dose is missed, administer it as soon as possible and then continue with the regular schedule. Discard the bottle seven days after first opening.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* **Nervous System:** Headache
* **Ophthalmic (Eye-related):** Blurred vision, deposits on or around the eye surface, eye discomfort, irritation, pain, itching, redness, increased tearing (lacrimation),  ocular hyperemia (redness of the eye), photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to light), and visual field defects.


Less common, but potentially serious, side effects may also occur.  It's crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.

### How it Works

Cysteamine is a cystine-depleting agent.  It works by chemically reacting with cystine, a type of amino acid, to convert it into cysteine and cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfides. This process reduces the accumulation of cystine crystals in the cornea. By decreasing the concentration of cystine, it helps to clear the corneal deposits and improve vision.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cysteamine ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to cysteamine or any component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) and/or papilledema (swelling of the optic nerve).  Regular monitoring is important.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks to the fetus. The excretion of cysteamine in breast milk is unknown; carefully weigh the benefits of breastfeeding against potential risks to the infant.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  While the manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for liver or kidney problems, adjustments may not be necessary due to the low systemic absorption of the ophthalmic solution. Consult with a doctor.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on individual response and the severity of the cystine deposits.  Regular ophthalmic examinations are crucial to monitor progress.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Administer the missed dose as soon as you remember, and then continue with your regular dosing schedule.

* **Q: How should I store cysteamine ophthalmic solution?** A: Store the solution as directed on the label, usually at room temperature and away from direct light and heat.

* **Q: Can I use this medication with other eye drops?** A:  Yes, but administer other eye drops at least 10 minutes before or after using cysteamine. Apply eye ointments last.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.
