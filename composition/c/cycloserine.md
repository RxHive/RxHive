# Cycloserine
### Generic Name
Cycloserine

### Usage
Cycloserine is a broad-spectrum antibiotic primarily used as a second-line treatment for tuberculosis (TB), particularly active pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB).  It's crucial to understand that cycloserine is *not* a first-line treatment and is always used in combination with other anti-TB medications.  Its effectiveness hinges on its use within a carefully managed drug regimen designed to combat the specific TB strain.

In some cases, cycloserine might also be considered for treating acute urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by susceptible bacteria, but only when other, more conventional treatments have proven ineffective. This is less common than its use in treating TB.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and their response to the medication.  Always follow the instructions given by your doctor.  This information is for general knowledge only and should not be used to self-medicate.

**Tuberculosis:**

* **Adults:** Initial oral dose may be 250 mg twice daily for 14 days, followed by a maintenance dose ranging from 500 mg to 1000 mg daily, divided into two doses. The maximum daily dose is generally 1 gram.  Some regimens use a dose based on weight (10-15 mg/kg/day).  Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is often given concurrently to reduce the risk of neurological side effects.
* **Children:** The dosage for children is typically calculated based on their weight, usually 15-20 mg/kg/day, divided into one or two doses.  The maximum daily dose remains 1 gram.  Again, pyridoxine is frequently co-administered.


**Urinary Tract Infections (UTI):**

* **Adults:**  The dosage for UTIs is typically lower, often starting around 15-20 mg/day, but the maximum daily dose remains 1 gram.  This should only be used under strict medical supervision and if other treatments have failed.  The use in UTIs is rare.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment aren't explicitly detailed in standard guidelines, and use is contraindicated in cases of severe renal impairment.  However, careful monitoring of blood levels and potential side effects is vital for patients with any form of organ impairment.



### Side Effects

Cycloserine can cause a range of side effects, some common and others more serious but less frequent.  If you experience any adverse effects, contact your doctor immediately.


* **Common:** Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Confusion, depression, anxiety, psychosis, seizures, tremors, peripheral neuropathy (numbness or tingling in the extremities),  hyperreflexia (overactive reflexes), hearing loss, liver problems.


### How it Works

Cycloserine is a bacteriostatic antibiotic. This means it inhibits the growth and multiplication of bacteria, rather than directly killing them.  It achieves this by interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis. Specifically, it competes with D-alanine, an amino acid crucial for cell wall construction. By disrupting this process, cycloserine prevents bacteria from building functional cell walls, ultimately hindering their growth and replication.  In the case of TB, it effectively targets *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, contributing to its eradication when used in combination with other drugs.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cycloserine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug, severe renal insufficiency, uncontrolled epilepsy, severe depression, severe anxiety, or psychosis.  Concurrent excessive alcohol use is also a contraindication.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Cycloserine can interact with several other medications.  Alcohol consumption increases the risk of neurological side effects.  Certain other drugs, including some other anti-tuberculosis medications, may increase the risk of adverse effects. Consult your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Patients with a history of seizures, chronic alcoholism, depression, anxiety, psychosis, or renal impairment should be carefully monitored.  The risk of central nervous system (CNS) toxicity increases with higher doses.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the use of cycloserine with their doctor, as the drug can cross the placenta and is excreted in breast milk.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking cycloserine?** A: No, alcohol significantly increases the risk of serious neurological side effects.  Avoid alcohol completely during treatment.

* **Q: How should I store cycloserine?** A: Store cycloserine at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Follow the specific storage instructions on the product label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about missed doses.

* **Q:  Are there any specific dietary recommendations?** A: Maintaining a balanced diet, rich in B vitamins, is generally advised. Your doctor may recommend specific dietary supplements.

* **Q: How long will I need to take cycloserine?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your condition and response to therapy. Treatment for TB is typically long term, often several months or years, and requires strict adherence to the prescribed regimen.
