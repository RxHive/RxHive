# Cycloserine

**Generic Name:** Cycloserine

**Usage:** Cycloserine is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis (TB), specifically in cases that are resistant to other drugs.  It's typically used in combination with other anti-TB medications. It may also be used to treat certain types of bacterial meningitis.  However, due to its significant side effects, it's reserved for situations where other treatments have failed or are unsuitable.

**Side Effects:** Cycloserine has a notable range of side effects, some of which can be serious.  These include:

* **Neurological effects:**  These are the most concerning and common side effects. They can range from mild dizziness and drowsiness to serious issues like seizures, psychosis (including hallucinations, paranoia, and confusion), peripheral neuropathy (numbness and tingling in the extremities), and depression.
* **Gastrointestinal problems:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are relatively common.
* **Skin reactions:** Rashes and itching can occur.
* **Other possible side effects:**  Headache, fatigue, fever, and impaired coordination.


**How it Works:** Cycloserine is a type of antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis. It works by interfering with the production of a specific bacterial enzyme involved in this process. This ultimately leads to the death of the bacteria.  Specifically, it targets the D-alanine-D-alanine portion of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.
