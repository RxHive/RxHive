# Ceritinib

**Generic Name:** Ceritinib

**Usage:** Ceritinib is a targeted therapy used to treat certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Specifically, it's used for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC that has progressed after treatment with crizotinib.  It may also be used in some cases of ROS1-positive NSCLC.  It's important to note that its use is dependent on specific genetic mutations in the cancer cells.  A doctor will determine if it's the right treatment option.

**Side Effects:** Ceritinib, like many cancer treatments, can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea:** Often severe and requiring medication to manage.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Can be debilitating for some patients.
* **Increased liver enzymes:**  Requiring monitoring of liver function.
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling tired and weak.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty with bowel movements.
* **Increased appetite:** Can lead to weight gain.
* **Cough:**  May be exacerbated.
* **Pneumonitis (lung inflammation):** A serious side effect requiring immediate medical attention.


Serious side effects, though less common, include:

* **Severe diarrhea:** Leading to dehydration.
* **Liver damage (hepatotoxicity):** Can be life-threatening.
* **Pneumonitis:**  Inflammation of the lungs.
* **Cardiac effects:** Including heart rhythm abnormalities.
* **Muscle weakness:**  Myopathy.
* **Increased risk of bleeding:**  Due to thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary greatly between individuals.  It's crucial to report any new or worsening symptoms to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Ceritinib is an ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) and ROS1 (ROS proto-oncogene 1) tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  This means it works by blocking the activity of the ALK and ROS1 enzymes.  These enzymes are often abnormally active in certain types of lung cancer, driving cancer cell growth and division. By inhibiting these enzymes, ceritinib helps to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is Ceritinib a first-line treatment for lung cancer?** A: No, typically Ceritinib is used as a second-line or later-line treatment for ALK-positive or ROS1-positive NSCLC after other therapies have failed.
* **Q: How is Ceritinib administered?** A: Ceritinib is taken orally as a tablet.
* **Q: How long will I need to take Ceritinib?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your response to the medication and any side effects experienced.  This is determined by your oncologist.
* **Q: What are the drug interactions?** A:  Ceritinib can interact with other medications. It's essential to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (like ketoconazole) should be avoided.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: Are there any specific monitoring requirements while on Ceritinib?** A:  Yes, regular blood tests to monitor liver function, complete blood count, and other factors are necessary to assess for side effects and the effectiveness of the treatment.  Regular check-ups with your oncologist are crucial.
