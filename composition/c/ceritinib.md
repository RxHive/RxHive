# Ceritinib
### Generic Name
Ceritinib

### Usage
Ceritinib is primarily used to treat adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK).  This means the cancer cells have a specific abnormality in the ALK gene that drives their growth.  Ceritinib's effectiveness is confirmed through FDA-approved testing to identify ALK-positive tumors.  It's important to note that Ceritinib is not suitable for all types of lung cancer.


### Dosage
The standard oral dose for adults with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC is 450 mg once daily, taken with food. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  There is some regional variation in prescribing which may still use a dose of 750mg once daily in a fasted state, so you should always follow the exact directions provided by your physician.

Dosage adjustments are necessary based on several factors:

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For mild to moderate liver impairment, no dosage adjustment is usually needed. For severe impairment, the dose should be reduced by approximately one-third (to the nearest multiple of 150 mg).  Specific adjustments depend on lab results and clinical judgment.

* **Renal Impairment:** For creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥30 to 90 mL/minute, no adjustment is typically necessary.  The manufacturer does not provide guidance for CrCl <30 mL/minute.

* **Toxicity Management:**  Dose reductions (to 300 mg or 150 mg daily) or treatment interruption may be necessary if side effects like bradycardia (slow heart rate), QTc prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm), severe gastrointestinal issues (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), or elevated liver enzymes occur.  In some cases of severe toxicity, the medication may need to be stopped permanently.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Ceritinib in children have not been established.

### How it Works
Ceritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by blocking the activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a protein that plays a crucial role in the growth and spread of certain cancer cells.  By inhibiting ALK, Ceritinib disrupts the cancer cell's signaling pathways, preventing their uncontrolled proliferation and contributing to tumor shrinkage.  Ceritinib also targets other kinases such as the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), insulin receptor (InsR), and ROS1.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ceritinib is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it or its components and those with congenital long QT syndrome or a persistent Fridericia-corrected electrocardiogram (QTcF) interval >500 msec.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Strong CYP3A inhibitors (like ketoconazole) and inducers (like rifampin) should be avoided. Ceritinib can also inhibit CYP3A and CYP2C9 enzymes, potentially affecting the metabolism of other drugs. Consult your doctor about any medications you are taking.

* **Warnings:** Ceritinib may increase the risk of bradycardia, gastrointestinal toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, and QTc prolongation. Regular monitoring of relevant lab values is crucial.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ceritinib is categorized as pregnancy category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus. Effective contraception is essential during treatment and for six months afterward. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for two weeks after stopping the medication.

* **Other Precautions:** Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice, as they can affect Ceritinib's metabolism.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Ceritinib?**  A: It's best to avoid alcohol while on Ceritinib, as it can worsen some side effects, particularly gastrointestinal issues.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose unless the next dose is due within 12 hours. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Ceritinib?** A: Store Ceritinib at room temperature, away from moisture and light.  Follow the specific storage instructions on the label.

* **Q: How long will I be on Ceritinib?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the response to therapy and the presence of side effects. It’s determined by your doctor.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions?** A: Take Ceritinib with food to improve absorption and potentially reduce gastrointestinal upset.  Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice.

* **Q: Who should I contact if I have questions or concerns?**  A: Always consult your doctor or pharmacist for any questions or concerns related to Ceritinib.  They can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
