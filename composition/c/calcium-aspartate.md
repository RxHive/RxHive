# Calcium Aspartate
### Generic Name
Calcium Aspartate

### Usage
Calcium aspartate is primarily used as a calcium supplement.  Its main purpose is to improve calcium levels in the body, which is crucial for maintaining strong bones and teeth.  This makes it beneficial in addressing conditions where calcium deficiency is a contributing factor, such as:

* **Osteoporosis:** A disease characterized by weakened bones, increasing the risk of fractures. Calcium aspartate can help slow bone loss and improve bone density.
* **Osteoarthritis:**  A degenerative joint disease. While not a direct treatment, adequate calcium intake can support overall bone health and potentially alleviate some symptoms related to bone deterioration.
* **Osteospurs (bone spurs):**  Bony growths that can develop on joints.  Improved calcium levels may contribute to better bone health and potentially reduce the development or progression of bone spurs.
* **Fibromyalgia:** A chronic condition causing widespread musculoskeletal pain.  Some studies suggest a link between calcium deficiency and fibromyalgia symptoms, and supplementation might offer some relief for some individuals, though more research is needed.
* **Fatigue:** While not a direct treatment for fatigue, adequate calcium intake is essential for proper muscle function and overall energy levels.  A calcium deficiency could contribute to fatigue.

It's important to note that calcium aspartate is a supplement and not a cure for these conditions.  It should be used in conjunction with other appropriate medical treatments and lifestyle modifications recommended by a healthcare professional.  For children, it helps in building strong bones and teeth during growth.

### Dosage
Dosage of calcium aspartate varies depending on individual needs, age, and the specific condition being addressed.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions.  There is no universally recommended dosage and it should always be determined by a healthcare professional after considering the individual's specific medical history and current health status.  Different forms (tablets, capsules, etc.) may also have varying concentrations of calcium aspartate.  

**It's crucial to consult a doctor before starting any calcium supplement, including calcium aspartate, particularly for children.**  Self-medication can be dangerous.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of calcium aspartate are generally mild and may include:

* Constipation
* Nausea
* Gas
* Stomach upset

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible, including:

* Kidney stones (especially in individuals predisposed to kidney stones)
* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels), which can lead to serious complications such as cardiac arrhythmias.


If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe ones, stop taking the medication and consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Calcium aspartate is a form of calcium that is more readily absorbed by the body compared to some other calcium salts.  The aspartate part of the molecule assists in the absorption process in the intestines. Once absorbed, calcium plays a vital role in building and maintaining strong bones and teeth.  It also participates in many other bodily functions, including muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.  By improving calcium levels, calcium aspartate helps support these essential processes.

### Precautions
* **Kidney stones:** Individuals with a history of kidney stones should use caution and consult their doctor before taking calcium aspartate, as it can increase the risk of kidney stone formation.
* **Hypercalcemia:** People with high blood calcium levels should avoid calcium aspartate.
* **Drug Interactions:** Calcium aspartate may interact with certain medications, such as some antibiotics and diuretics.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before taking calcium aspartate if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Children:** The dosage for children needs to be determined by a physician based on their age and individual requirements.
