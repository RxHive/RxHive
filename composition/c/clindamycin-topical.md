# Clindamycin (Topical)
### Generic Name
Clindamycin (Topical)

### Usage
Clindamycin topical is a broad-spectrum antibiotic primarily used to treat acne vulgaris (common acne) and bacterial vaginosis (a vaginal infection).  It's applied directly to the skin or intravaginally, depending on the condition.  While primarily indicated for these two conditions, it's also sometimes used off-label for other skin conditions like hidradenitis suppurativa (a chronic inflammatory skin disease) and rosacea (a skin condition causing redness and bumps).  Use of Clindamycin for these off-label purposes should be under the direct guidance of a healthcare professional.  

### Dosage

**Acne Vulgaris:**

* **Gel/Lotion/Solution (1%):**  Apply a thin film twice daily (BID).
* **Gel/Foam (1%):** Apply once daily (OD).

**Important Note:** The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommends using topical Clindamycin for acne in combination with other therapies (not as monotherapy) to reduce the risk of bacterial resistance. For mild acne, it's often combined with benzoyl peroxide.  For moderate to severe acne, it may be used with a topical retinoid or a systemic antibiotic.

**Bacterial Vaginosis:**

Several dosing regimens exist, and the best approach depends on the formulation and the patient's individual circumstances (pregnant or non-pregnant):

* **Intravaginal Suppositories (100mg):** Insert one suppository daily at bedtime for 3 days.
* **Intravaginal Cream (2%):**  One full applicator inserted once daily (OD) before bedtime for 3 days (non-pregnant) or 7 days (pregnant). Alternatively, a single application of one full applicator can be used for non-pregnant patients.

**Other Uses (Off-Label):**

Dosages for off-label uses such as hidradenitis suppurativa and rosacea vary and must be determined by a healthcare professional.  Generally, topical application is twice daily (BID) to the affected areas.

**Pediatric Use:**

The safety and effectiveness of topical Clindamycin in children under 12 years old haven't been established.  For adolescents (12 years and older), dosages are generally similar to adult dosages, but always follow a doctor's specific instructions.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Topical):**

* Dry skin (xeroderma)
* Oily skin
* Redness (erythema)
* Burning sensation
* Skin peeling (exfoliation)
* Itching (pruritus)

**Common Side Effects (Vaginal):**

* Vaginal yeast infection (moniliasis)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (All Routes):**

* Severe diarrhea (possibly indicating colitis)
* Pseudomembranous colitis (a serious bowel infection)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, stop using the medication and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic. It works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis, essentially preventing bacteria from growing and multiplying.  For acne, the exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it likely involves reducing the number of acne-causing bacteria.

### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Do not use if you're allergic to clindamycin, lincomycin, or any ingredients in the formulation.
* **Colitis History:** Avoid use if you have a history of antibiotic-associated colitis, regional enteritis, or ulcerative colitis.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Clindamycin is in pregnancy category B (animal studies showed no risk), but use during pregnancy should only occur under the supervision of a healthcare professional.  The excretion of Clindamycin into breast milk is unknown.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Clindamycin can interact with other medications, particularly other antibiotics like erythromycin. Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Atopic Patients/Neonates:** Use with caution in individuals with atopic dermatitis (eczema) or neonates.
* **Avoid Contact with Eyes, Mouth, and Mucous Membranes:**  For topical use, carefully avoid contact with eyes, mouth, and mucous membranes.  For vaginal use, follow application instructions carefully.



### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take to see results?**
A:  The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual.  It may take several weeks for noticeable results.

**Q: Can I stop taking Clindamycin if I feel better?**
A: No, complete the prescribed course of treatment even if symptoms improve to prevent recurrence and the development of bacterial resistance.

**Q: How should I store Clindamycin?**
A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature away from heat and moisture.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

**Q:  Is Clindamycin safe for long-term use?**
A: Long-term use can increase the risk of side effects, particularly C. difficile infection.  It is generally not recommended for extended periods without ongoing medical supervision.
