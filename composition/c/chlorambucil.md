# Chlorambucil

**Generic Name:** Chlorambucil

**Usage:**

Chlorambucil is a chemotherapy drug used primarily to treat:

* **Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL):**  It's often used as a first-line treatment or in later stages of the disease.
* **Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL):**  It may be used for certain types of NHL, particularly indolent (slow-growing) lymphomas.
* **Hodgkin's lymphoma:** Less common than in the lymphomas above, it may be used in some cases.
* **Myelofibrosis:** In certain situations, it may be used to help manage symptoms.
* **Aplastic anemia:**  In rare instances, and usually as part of a combined treatment strategy.
* **Autoimmune disorders (off-label):**  In some cases, it may be used to treat autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis or nephrotic syndrome; however, this is much less common due to its significant side effects and the availability of safer alternatives.  Its use in these contexts should be considered carefully and only by specialists.


**Side Effects:**

Chlorambucil can cause a wide range of side effects, some mild and some severe.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, fatigue, hair loss (alopecia), low white blood cell count (leukopenia), low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low red blood cell count (anemia).
* **Serious side effects:**  Increased risk of infection (due to low white blood cell count), easy bruising or bleeding (due to low platelet count), severe anemia, kidney problems, liver damage, infertility, secondary cancers (leukemia),  pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring).  Also, increased risk of developing other malignancies in the future.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but can be serious, including rash, itching, difficulty breathing.

It's crucial to report any side effects to your doctor immediately.


**How it Works:**

Chlorambucil is an alkylating agent. It works by damaging the DNA of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells. This damage interferes with the cancer cells' ability to reproduce and grow, leading to cell death.  It's not specific to cancer cells and can also damage healthy cells, which is why it causes many side effects.
