# Cyclosporine (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Cyclosporine (Systemic)

### Usage

Cyclosporine is a powerful immunosuppressant, primarily used to prevent organ rejection after transplantation of kidneys, livers, and hearts.  It works by suppressing the body's immune system, reducing its tendency to attack the newly transplanted organ.  

Beyond transplantation, cyclosporine also has important, albeit secondary, uses in treating:

* **Severe rheumatoid arthritis:**  It's used in cases where other treatments like methotrexate haven't been effective.
* **Severe plaque psoriasis:**  It's an option for adults with extensive, unresponsive psoriasis that hasn't improved with other systemic therapies.

It's crucial to understand that cyclosporine is a potent drug, and its use should be under strict medical supervision.  It's not a first-line treatment for any of these conditions.


### Dosage

Cyclosporine dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the specific condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, and overall health, as well as their response to the medication.  **Crucially,  cyclosporine formulations (modified vs. non-modified) are not interchangeable and require different dosing.**  Always follow your doctor's precise instructions.  The following provides general information only and should not be interpreted as a prescription.

**Adults:**

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated. Examples include:

* **Organ transplantation (prophylaxis):** Oral administration typically begins at 15 mg/kg 4-12 hours before transplantation, followed by a reduced maintenance dose over several weeks. IV administration may be used initially, followed by oral medication once tolerated.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis:** Oral doses typically start at 2.5 mg/kg/day (modified cyclosporine) divided into two doses.  The dose may be increased gradually under medical supervision.
* **Psoriasis:** Oral doses typically start at 2.5 mg/kg/day (modified cyclosporine) divided into two doses.  The dose may be adjusted as needed, and treatment is generally not recommended for more than a year.

**Children:**

Pediatric dosing is also highly variable depending on the condition and the child's age, weight, and overall health.  A physician will determine the appropriate dosage and closely monitor the child's response.

**Administration:**

* **Oral:** Cyclosporine is available in capsules and oral solutions.  Specific instructions on taking the medication with food or drinks (avoiding grapefruit juice) will be provided by your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Intravenous (IV):** IV cyclosporine is usually administered over several hours.

### Side Effects

Cyclosporine can cause various side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  

**Common side effects:**

* Headache
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Edema (swelling)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Increased susceptibility to infections


**Less common, but potentially serious side effects:**

* Tremor
* Kidney problems (increased serum creatinine)
* Liver problems (hepatotoxicity)
* High blood sugar
* Changes in blood counts
* Increased risk of certain cancers (lymphoma)

**If you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor. Calcineurin is an enzyme that plays a key role in the activation of T cells, a type of white blood cell crucial to the immune response. By inhibiting calcineurin, cyclosporine reduces the production of interleukin-2, a cytokine essential for T-cell growth and proliferation.  This dampens the immune response, preventing the rejection of transplanted organs and reducing the activity of the immune system in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cyclosporine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or its components, those with uncontrolled hypertension or significant kidney problems, and those with uncontrolled infections or certain types of malignancies.  Specific contraindications may also apply to certain conditions.
* **Drug Interactions:** Cyclosporine interacts with numerous other medications.  It's critical to inform your doctor of all medications, herbal supplements, or other substances you are taking. Some medications can increase or decrease cyclosporine levels in the body, affecting its efficacy and safety.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Cyclosporine is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus. Its use during pregnancy should be carefully considered and only when the benefits outweigh the potential harms. It's excreted in breast milk and should be avoided during breastfeeding.
* **Specific Populations:**  Elderly patients and those with impaired liver or kidney function may require dose adjustments or closer monitoring.  Children will have their dosages carefully adjusted by a physician based on age and weight.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take cyclosporine?**  A: The duration of treatment varies widely depending on the condition and your response to the medication.  Your physician will determine the appropriate duration.

* **Q: Can I stop taking cyclosporine suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping cyclosporine abruptly can have serious consequences.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering the dose.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store cyclosporine?** A: Store cyclosporine as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Are there any foods or drinks I should avoid while taking cyclosporine?** A: Grapefruit juice can interfere with cyclosporine metabolism and should be avoided.  Your doctor or pharmacist can provide more specific guidance.
