# Collagenase (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Collagenase (Systemic)

### Usage
Collagenase (systemic) is a medication used to treat two specific conditions in adults:

* **Dupuytren's contracture:** This condition causes thickening and tightening of the tissue under the skin of the palm and fingers, leading to bent or crooked fingers.  Collagenase is used when a palpable (easily felt) cord is present.

* **Peyronie's disease:** This condition involves the formation of a hard plaque (scar tissue) within the penis, causing pain, curvature (bending), and sometimes erectile dysfunction.  Collagenase is used in adult men with a palpable plaque and a curvature of at least 30 degrees at the start of treatment.

### Dosage
Collagenase (systemic) is administered via intralesional injection (directly into the affected area).  Dosage and administration vary depending on the condition:

**Dupuytren's Contracture:**

* 0.58 mg of Collagenase is injected into a palpable Dupuytren's cord affecting either a metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint or a proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint.  The injection procedure is carefully followed.
* 24-72 hours after the injection, a finger extension procedure is typically performed to help break up the cord if a contracture persists.
* Up to three injections per cord, at roughly 4-week intervals, may be administered.
* Only one cord is injected at a time. If multiple cords are affected, they are injected sequentially.
* The medication is supplied as a lyophilized powder and must be reconstituted with the provided diluent before use.

**Peyronie's Disease:**

* 0.58 mg is injected into the Peyronie's plaque causing the curvature deformity. If more than one plaque is present, only the one causing curvature is targeted.
* A treatment course includes a maximum of four cycles.
* Each cycle consists of two Collagenase injections (1-3 days apart) followed by a penile modeling procedure (1-3 days after the second injection).
* The interval between treatment cycles is approximately 6 weeks.  The maximum treatment course is 8 injections and 4 modeling procedures.
* The medication is supplied as a lyophilized powder and must be reconstituted with the provided diluent before use.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of Collagenase (systemic) have not been established in children.


### Side Effects
Side effects vary depending on the condition being treated and the injection site.  Common side effects include:

**Dupuytren's Contracture:**

* Swelling (peripheral edema), particularly in the injected hand
* Itching (pruritus)
* Bruising (ecchymosis)
* Hemorrhagic blisters
* Pain, tenderness, bleeding, swelling, and inflammation at the injection site
* Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes)
* Limb pain


**Peyronie's Disease:**

* Penile hematoma (bruising)
* Penile swelling
* Penile pain
* Penile ecchymoses
* Penile popping sensation
* Blisters on the penis
* Painful erection
* Erectile dysfunction
* Dyspareunia (painful intercourse)


Less common but potentially serious side effects include: tendon rupture, hypersensitivity reactions, and in Peyronie's disease, the potential for penile fracture (corporal rupture).  Any concerning side effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Collagenase (systemic) contains two types of collagenase enzymes derived from *Clostridium histolyticum* bacteria.  These enzymes break down collagen, a protein that forms the structural framework of the Dupuytren's cord and Peyronie's plaque.  By breaking down collagen, the medication helps to loosen and disrupt the contracted tissue, improving finger flexibility in Dupuytren's contracture and reducing penile curvature in Peyronie's disease.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Collagenase (systemic) is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Collagenase or any of its components.

* **Peyronie's Disease Specific:** Collagenase should not be injected into Peyronie's plaques involving the penile urethra. There's an increased risk of penile fracture (corporal rupture), severe penile hematoma, and other serious penile injuries.  Close monitoring is crucial, and patients should be aware of the signs and symptoms of these serious complications. A Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program is in place to manage these risks.

* **Bleeding Disorders:** Collagenase should be used cautiously in patients with bleeding disorders due to the risk of bleeding at the injection site.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Collagenase is a Category B drug in pregnancy (animal studies have not shown harm, but human studies are lacking). The excretion in breast milk is unknown, therefore caution is advised.

* **Other Medications:** Although systemic absorption is low, potential interactions with other medications should be discussed with your doctor.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are not typically needed for patients with kidney or liver problems.

### FAQs

* **How long does treatment last?**  The duration of treatment varies depending on the condition and individual response.

* **How is the medication stored?**  Follow the storage instructions provided with the medication.

* **What if I miss a dose?** Contact your doctor immediately to determine the appropriate next steps.  Do not attempt to adjust the dosage or timing of injections without medical supervision.

* **Are there any long-term effects?** Long-term effects are not fully understood. Close follow-up with your healthcare provider is essential.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your doctor or other healthcare provider promptly.
