# Copper Chloride
### Generic Name
Copper Chloride

### Usage

Copper chloride is primarily used as a supplement in intravenous solutions administered during total parenteral nutrition (TPN).  TPN is a method of providing nutrition intravenously, bypassing the digestive system.  Copper is an essential trace mineral, and its intravenous supplementation through copper chloride prevents or corrects copper deficiency, which can arise from inadequate dietary intake or during prolonged periods of TPN.  Copper deficiency can lead to serious health issues, including anemia, neutropenia (low white blood cell count), and impaired iron metabolism.  While not a primary use, copper chloride may also play a supportive role in managing conditions where copper loss is accelerated, such as high-output intestinal fistulas (abnormal connections between the intestine and other organs).

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the patient's age, weight, and specific needs.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage from a healthcare professional and never attempt self-medication.

**Adults:**

* **Dietary Reference Intake (DRI):** The recommended daily intake (RDA) for adults is 900 mcg for both males and females. This increases during pregnancy (1000 mcg) and lactation (1300 mcg).  These values are for dietary intake, and the parenteral (IV) dosage will differ.
* **Parenteral Nutrition:** For maintenance, the typical intravenous dose in adults ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 mg/day or 0.5-1.5 mg/day, depending on the specific manufacturer's guidelines. In cases of high-output intestinal fistulas, the dose might be doubled.  This should be administered as part of a complete parenteral nutrition solution, and the preparation and administration should be done by a healthcare professional.

**Children:**

Dosage for children is determined by weight and age and is typically expressed in mcg/kg/day (micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day).  Pediatric doses for parenteral nutrition typically range from 20 mcg/kg/day in infants under 10 kg to 5-20 mcg/kg/day in children and adolescents, with a maximum daily dose of 500 mcg. Precise dosing in children requires careful monitoring and calculation by a healthcare professional. Always refer to the prescribing information for the exact dosage according to the child's age and weight.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are routinely recommended for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised, and dosage reduction or discontinuation may be necessary in cases of liver or kidney problems; monitoring is crucial.


### Side Effects

* Excessive copper levels in the blood (hypercupremia).
* Hepatic insufficiency (liver failure).
* Hepatic necrosis (liver cell death).

While less common, the serious side effects are potentially life-threatening and necessitate immediate medical attention. Any unusual symptom should be reported to a doctor or other healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Copper is an essential trace mineral that acts as a cofactor for several enzymes, notably ceruloplasmin. Ceruloplasmin plays a vital role in iron metabolism by facilitating the proper formation of transferrin, the protein that transports iron in the blood.  Copper also contributes to the formation of red and white blood cells and overall healthy blood production.  Supplementation with copper chloride addresses copper deficiency by providing the necessary copper to the body, restoring the normal function of these processes and preventing or alleviating deficiency-related symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Copper chloride is contraindicated in patients with Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder that causes the body to retain excess copper.
* **Interactions:**  Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) can interact with copper chloride and decrease the serum concentration of vitamin C. To minimize this, healthcare professionals may choose to add multivitamins to the TPN solution right before infusion or administer them in separate containers.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Copper chloride is categorized as pregnancy category C, indicating that studies on its safety during pregnancy are insufficient. Caution should be exercised, and its use should be carefully weighed against potential risks. The excretion of copper chloride in breast milk is also not well established, necessitating caution during breastfeeding.
* **General Precautions:** Patients with high-output intestinal fistulas may require higher doses than standard recommendations. Copper chloride must be diluted before intravenous administration.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take copper chloride supplements without a doctor's prescription?**  A: No. Copper chloride is administered intravenously and should only be given under a doctor's supervision, usually as part of a TPN regimen.  Self-medicating with copper can be harmful.
* **Q: How is copper chloride stored?** A: Store copper chloride solutions as directed by the manufacturer.  Generally, these solutions need to be refrigerated and protected from light to maintain stability.  Always refer to the specific storage instructions provided with the medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any unusual symptoms or side effects to your healthcare provider immediately.
* **Q: Is copper chloride safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use requires close medical monitoring, including regular blood tests to measure copper levels.  The healthcare professional will assess the need for continued supplementation and adjust the dosage accordingly.
