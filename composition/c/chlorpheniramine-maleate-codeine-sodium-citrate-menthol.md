# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Codeine + Sodium Citrate + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Codeine Phosphate + Sodium Citrate + Menthol

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and the flu, particularly those involving a cough and congestion.  Specifically, it addresses:

* **Cough:** Codeine phosphate acts as an opioid cough suppressant, reducing the urge to cough.
* **Runny nose/Congestion:** Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that helps dry up nasal secretions.
* **Congestion relief (secondary):** Sodium citrate acts as an expectorant, helping to thin mucus and make it easier to cough up.  Menthol provides a cooling sensation that may offer some temporary relief from congestion.

**Important Note:** This combination is generally only available with a prescription due to the presence of codeine.  The use of codeine is carefully controlled because of its addictive potential.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage, but common ones include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect of both codeine and chlorpheniramine.
* **Dry mouth:**  A common side effect of antihistamines.
* **Constipation:**  A common side effect of codeine.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Less common but possible.
* **Dizziness:**  Especially likely with higher doses or in sensitive individuals.
* **Headache:** Possible.
* **Difficulty urinating:** Possible.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, serious allergic reactions can occur.  Signs may include rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing.

**How it Works:**

* **Codeine Phosphate:**  Binds to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, suppressing the cough reflex.  It also has some mild analgesic (pain-relieving) effects.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction or infection, thus reducing runny nose and nasal congestion.
* **Sodium Citrate:** Increases the fluid content of respiratory tract secretions, making them less viscous and easier to expectorate.
* **Menthol:** Creates a cooling sensation in the nasal passages and throat, potentially providing some relief from congestion discomfort.
