# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Codeine + Sodium Citrate + Menthol
### Generic Name:  Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Codeine Phosphate + Sodium Citrate + Menthol

This combination is typically found in over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medications.  It's important to note that the specific ratios of these ingredients can vary between different brands.  Always refer to the product label for precise information.


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  The individual components contribute to different aspects of symptom relief:

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine that helps to dry up runny noses and reduce sneezing.
* **Codeine Phosphate:** This is an opioid cough suppressant (antitussive). It works on the brain to reduce the cough reflex.  **Important Note:**  Due to the potential for abuse and dependence, codeine-containing products are increasingly restricted or require a prescription in many regions.  Always check local regulations and consult a doctor before using medications containing codeine.
* **Sodium Citrate:** This acts as an expectorant, helping to thin and loosen mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up.
* **Menthol:** This provides a cooling sensation, which can soothe irritated throat tissues and provide temporary relief from coughing and congestion.


This combination is generally intended for symptomatic relief only and does not treat the underlying cause of the illness.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific product formulation and the age and weight of the patient.  **Always follow the instructions on the product label carefully.**  Do not exceed the recommended dose.  **For children, particularly, parental guidance and consultation with a pediatrician are crucial before administering any medication.**  This combination is generally not recommended for infants and very young children.  Intravenous (IV) administration is not applicable for this combination; it is typically taken orally as a liquid or tablet.  Never attempt to self-adjust the dosage. If you're unsure about the appropriate dose for yourself or a child, consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works

As mentioned above, each ingredient has a distinct mechanism of action:

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks histamine receptors, reducing the effects of histamine release in the body which contributes to cold symptoms like runny nose and sneezing.
* **Codeine Phosphate:** Depresses the cough center in the brain, reducing the urge to cough.
* **Sodium Citrate:** Increases the fluid content of mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel.
* **Menthol:** Acts as a counterirritant, creating a cooling sensation that can temporarily relieve throat irritation.
