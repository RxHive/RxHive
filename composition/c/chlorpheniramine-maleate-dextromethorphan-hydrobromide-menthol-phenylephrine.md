# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Menthol + Phenylephrine

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Menthol + Phenylephrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is a multi-symptom cold and cough reliever.  It's used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or flu, including:

* **Runny nose:** Phenylephrine is a decongestant that helps shrink swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages.
* **Cough:** Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant (antitussive) that reduces the urge to cough.
* **Sneezing and watery eyes:** Chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine that helps reduce these allergic-like symptoms.
* **Stuffy nose (some formulations):** Menthol provides a cooling sensation, which may temporarily relieve nasal congestion.  Note that menthol itself does not actively decongest.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects.  Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is particularly likely with chlorpheniramine.
* **Dry mouth:**  A common side effect of both antihistamines and decongestants.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be caused by any of the components.
* **Headache:** A relatively common side effect.
* **Nausea:** Less common, but possible.
* **Constipation:**  Can be associated with some antihistamines.
* **Insomnia (sleeplessness):**  Particularly if taken later in the day.
* **Increased heart rate (tachycardia):** More likely with phenylephrine.
* **High blood pressure:**  Possible with phenylephrine, especially in individuals with pre-existing hypertension.


**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate (Antihistamine):** Blocks the effects of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. This helps reduce runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide (Cough Suppressant):** Acts on the brain to reduce the cough reflex.  It doesn't treat the underlying cause of the cough, but it suppresses the urge to cough.
* **Menthol (Cooling Agent):** Creates a cooling sensation in the nasal passages, providing temporary relief from stuffiness.  It doesn't actively decongest.
* **Phenylephrine (Decongestant):**  Narrows blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
