# Cortisone
### Generic Name
Cortisone

### Usage

Cortisone is a corticosteroid hormone naturally produced by the adrenal glands.  It's used primarily to treat conditions requiring hormone replacement therapy, particularly in cases of adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), where the adrenal glands don't produce enough cortisol.  It also has significant anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant properties, making it useful for treating various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.  These include inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease.  It can also be used to manage allergic reactions and certain types of skin conditions. Note that while effective, Cortisone is often used for short-term management or in conjunction with other therapies.  Longer-term use usually requires careful monitoring due to potential side effects.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the specific formulation (oral tablets, injections, etc.).  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dose.  

**Adults:** For anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive purposes, initial oral doses typically range from 25 to 300 mg per day, adjusted based on response. For physiological replacement therapy (adrenal insufficiency), a lower dose of 20-35 mg daily, divided into 2-3 doses, is common. The largest dose is usually taken in the morning.

**Children and Adolescents:** Dosage for children is calculated based on weight or body surface area (BSA), typically ranging from 0.7-10 mg/kg/day or 20-300 mg/m²/day in divided doses.  Physiological replacement in children might necessitate 0.5-0.75 mg/kg/day or 20-25 mg/m²/day, also divided into doses.  Precise dosing must always be determined by a pediatrician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Caution is advised, and close monitoring is necessary in patients with these conditions.


### Side Effects

Cortisone, like other corticosteroids, can cause various side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  The likelihood and severity of these effects are influenced by dosage and duration of use.


* **Common Side Effects (affecting more than 10% of patients):** Insomnia, nervousness, dyspepsia (indigestion), increased appetite.
* **Less Common but Significant Side Effects (1-10% of patients):**  Diabetes mellitus, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), arthralgia (joint pain), cataracts, glaucoma, epistaxis (nosebleeds).
* **Rare but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**  Abdominal distention, acne, alkalosis, amenorrhea, amyotrophy (muscle wasting), bone fractures, bruising, Cushing's syndrome, decreased glucose tolerance, delirium, edema, emotional lability, euphoria, fluid retention, growth suppression (in children), hallucinations, headache, HPA-axis suppression (suppression of the body's natural hormone production), hyperglycemia, hyperpigmentation, hypersensitivity reactions, hypertension, hypokalemia (low potassium), myalgia (muscle pain), nausea, osteoporosis, pancreatitis, peptic ulcers, pseudotumor cerebri (a condition causing increased pressure in the brain), psychosis, seizures, skin atrophy, sodium retention, ulcerative esophagitis, vertigo, vomiting.


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as rare but serious, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Cortisone is a glucocorticoid, a type of steroid hormone.  It works by binding to specific receptors inside cells, influencing gene expression and thus affecting various bodily processes.  Its anti-inflammatory action involves suppressing the activity of immune cells that contribute to inflammation, reducing capillary permeability (leakiness of blood vessels), and inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators.  In hormone replacement therapy, it provides the essential cortisol needed for regulating metabolism, blood pressure, immune function, and stress response.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cortisone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to cortisone or any component, systemic fungal infections, co-administration with live virus vaccines (at immunosuppressive doses), certain infections (mycobacterial, viral, ocular herpes simplex), acute psychoses, and diverticulitis.
* **Interactions:** Cortisone can interact with numerous medications.  It may decrease the effectiveness of some drugs and increase the effects of others (see detailed interaction list in the provided source). It is crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, cataracts/glaucoma, heart failure/hypertension, GI diseases, hepatic/renal impairment, history of ocular herpes simplex, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, or history of seizures, and in elderly patients.  Long-term use can lead to adrenal suppression, requiring gradual tapering of the dose to avoid withdrawal symptoms.  Children's growth may be affected by long-term use.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding require careful monitoring and consultation with a physician as cortisone can cross the placental barrier and is secreted in breast milk.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking cortisone suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping cortisone abruptly can lead to adrenal insufficiency and potentially life-threatening withdrawal symptoms. Always taper the dose gradually under medical supervision.

* **Q: How should I store cortisone?** A: Store cortisone as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Is cortisone addictive?** A: Cortisone itself is not addictive in the same way as opioids. However, the body can become dependent on it, requiring gradual tapering to avoid withdrawal.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have concerns.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking cortisone?** A:  Consult your doctor about alcohol consumption while on cortisone, as alcohol can exacerbate some side effects and interact with other medications.
