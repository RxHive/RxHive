# Coenzyme Q + L-Carnitine L-Tartrate + Omega- + Eicosapentaenoic Acid + Docosahexanoic acidDHA + Selenium

## Generic Coenzyme Q10 + L-Carnitine L-Tartrate + Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA & DHA) + Selenium

**Generic Name:**  This product doesn't have a single generic name as it's a combination of several distinct ingredients.  We can list them individually: Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone), L-Carnitine L-Tartrate, Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), Selenium (often as selenomethionine or sodium selenite).

**Usage:** This combination supplement is often marketed for improving cardiovascular health, boosting energy levels, supporting brain function, and acting as an antioxidant.  Specific uses may vary depending on the dosage and individual formulation.  **It's crucial to note that this is not a treatment for any disease and should not replace medical advice.**  It's often used by individuals looking to:

* **Improve cardiovascular health:** CoQ10, EPA, and DHA support healthy heart function.
* **Boost energy levels:** CoQ10 and L-Carnitine are involved in energy production.
* **Enhance cognitive function:** DHA is crucial for brain health.
* **Support antioxidant defense:** CoQ10 and Selenium are potent antioxidants.

**Side Effects:** Side effects are generally mild and infrequent but can include:

* **CoQ10:** Upset stomach, nausea, diarrhea.  Rarely, it can interact with blood thinners.
* **L-Carnitine L-Tartrate:** Upset stomach, diarrhea, body odor.  High doses may cause nausea and vomiting.
* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA & DHA):**  Fish burps, upset stomach, diarrhea, increased bleeding risk (especially at high doses), potential interaction with blood thinners and blood pressure medications.
* **Selenium:**  In high doses, selenium can cause nausea, vomiting, hair loss, fatigue, and neurological problems.  Toxicity is a concern with excessive intake.

**How it Works:**

* **CoQ10:** Acts as an antioxidant and plays a vital role in energy production within the mitochondria (the powerhouses of cells).
* **L-Carnitine L-Tartrate:** Transports fatty acids into the mitochondria to be burned for energy.
* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA & DHA):**  EPA and DHA are essential fatty acids with anti-inflammatory properties.  They are important components of cell membranes and play a role in heart and brain health.
* **Selenium:** Acts as a cofactor for several antioxidant enzymes, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals.

The synergistic effect of combining these ingredients is believed to enhance their individual benefits.
