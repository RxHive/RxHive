# Cefetamet Pivoxil
### Generic Name
Cefetamet Pivoxil

### Usage
Cefetamet pivoxil is an oral cephalosporin antibiotic primarily used to treat various bacterial infections.  Its main applications include uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, and infections of the respiratory tract (such as pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and sinusitis), and urinary tract infections (UTIs).  While it's effective against a range of bacteria, it's crucial to ensure the infection is caused by susceptible bacteria before using this medication.  The specific bacteria it targets are detailed in the prescribing information.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific infection being treated.  Generally, for susceptible bacterial infections, the usual dose is 500 mg twice daily (BID). However, for uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis, a single 1.5-2 g dose is typical.  For pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, and streptococcal pharyngitis, the typical dose is 500-1000 mg BID for 7-10 days. UTI dosages range from a single 2g dose for uncomplicated cases to 1-2g daily for 10-15 days in more severe cases like acute pyelonephritis.  Always follow the prescribing physician's specific instructions.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage in children depends on age and weight. For susceptible infections, children aged 6 months to 3 years (<15 kg) may receive 125 mg BID, while older children (3-9 years, 16-30 kg) may receive 250 mg BID. Doses are adjusted further for older children and adolescents based on their weight, generally mirroring adult dosage for those weighing over 40kg.  For lower respiratory tract infections or streptococcal pharyngitis, a dosage of 10-20 mg/kg BID is often used for a specified duration.  A healthcare provider should always determine the appropriate pediatric dosage.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal impairment significantly impacts cefetamet pivoxil dosage.  Adjustments are necessary based on creatinine clearance (CrCl).  The prescribing information provides detailed guidelines for dose reduction based on CrCl levels.  Individuals with hepatic impairment typically do not require dosage adjustments.  Patients undergoing hemodialysis require specific considerations as outlined in the prescribing information.

### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* Headache
* Dizziness

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (C. difficile colitis)
* Increased liver enzyme levels
* Blood disorders (leukopenia, eosinophilia)

If any adverse effects occur, especially severe or persistent ones, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Cefetamet pivoxil is a prodrug; it's converted in the body to its active form, cefetamet. Cefetamet is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.  Specifically, it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in bacteria, preventing the formation of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls. This disruption leads to bacterial cell death.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Cefetamet pivoxil is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to cefetamet, other cephalosporins, or penicillins (due to cross-reactivity).  A history of severe allergic reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics is a significant contraindication.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with reduced kidney function (renal impairment).
* **Gastrointestinal Issues:**  Caution is advised in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal diseases, particularly colitis.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of cefetamet pivoxil during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult a healthcare professional before use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Superinfections:** Like other antibiotics, prolonged use of cefetamet pivoxil can increase the risk of superinfections (e.g., fungal infections).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Consult a healthcare provider about potential interactions with other medications.

### FAQs

* **Can I take cefetamet pivoxil with food?** Cefetamet pivoxil can be taken 1 hour before or 1 hour after meals.
* **How should I store cefetamet pivoxil?** Store as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Can I stop taking cefetamet pivoxil when I feel better?** No, complete the entire course of treatment prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better. This helps prevent the recurrence of infection and the development of antibiotic resistance.
* **Is cefetamet pivoxil safe for everyone?** No, cefetamet pivoxil is not suitable for everyone, especially those with allergies or kidney problems.  Your doctor will assess your suitability for this medication.
