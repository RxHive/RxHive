# Clobetasol + Clotrimazole + Fusidic Acid

**Generic Name:** Clobetasol Propionate + Clotrimazole + Fusidic Acid Cream/Ointment (Note:  The exact generic name may vary slightly depending on the manufacturer and country.)


**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical treatment for skin conditions that involve a bacterial and/or fungal infection and inflammation. It's typically prescribed for:

* **Secondary bacterial and fungal skin infections superimposed on eczema or psoriasis:**  It addresses the inflammation (Clobetasol), fungus (Clotrimazole), and bacteria (Fusidic acid).
* **Severe eczema with superimposed infection:** Similar to above, this targets all aspects of the condition.
* **Other inflammatory skin conditions with secondary infection:** While often used for eczema and psoriasis, it may be prescribed for other conditions with a doctor's assessment.

**Important Note:** This medication is only for external use and should not be taken orally.  It should be applied only to the affected area as directed by a doctor.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency depending on the individual. Common side effects include:

* **Burning, stinging, or itching at the application site:** These are often mild and temporary.
* **Skin thinning (atrophy):** Prolonged use can lead to skin thinning, especially in sensitive areas.
* **Stretch marks (striae):**  A potential side effect of prolonged use, particularly with potent corticosteroids like clobetasol.
* **Skin discoloration (hypopigmentation):**  Loss of skin color.
* **Increased risk of infection:**  While treating infection, prolonged use can disrupt the skin barrier, potentially increasing the risk of new infections.
* **Acne-like eruptions:**  Especially common in certain individuals.
* **Folliculitis:** Inflammation of hair follicles.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but possible, including contact dermatitis.
* **Systemic absorption (rare but possible with extensive application or use on large areas of the body):**  This can lead to more widespread side effects associated with corticosteroids.


**How it Works:**

* **Clobetasol Propionate:** A potent corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response in the skin.
* **Clotrimazole:** An antifungal medication that kills fungi by interfering with the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.
* **Fusidic Acid:** An antibacterial medication that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, preventing bacterial growth and reproduction.

The combined action of these three components makes it effective against various skin conditions with mixed bacterial and fungal infections and inflammation.
