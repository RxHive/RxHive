# Chondrocytes, Autologous Cultured
### Generic Name
Chondrocytes, Autologous Cultured

### Usage
Chondrocytes, autologous cultured, is a specialized cellular therapy used to repair significant cartilage defects in the knee's femoral condyle (medial, lateral, or trochlea).  This treatment is specifically indicated for patients who haven't responded adequately to previous arthroscopic or surgical repair attempts, such as debridement, microfracture, drilling/abrasion arthroplasty, or osteochondral allografts/autografts.  It's designed to address symptomatic cartilage damage caused by acute or repetitive trauma.  This is not a treatment for generalized osteoarthritis.

### Dosage
The dosage of autologous cultured chondrocytes is highly individualized and depends on the size of the cartilage defect.  The cells are not administered alone; the procedure requires surgical implantation.

* **Implantation:** The number of vials needed depends on the size of the cartilage defect:
    * Defects ≤7 cm²: One vial (approximately 12 million cells).
    * Defects 7-14 cm²: Two vials.
    * Defects >14 cm²: Three vials.

* **Alternative Dosing:**  Another approach uses a dose of 0.8-1 million cells/cm² (80-100 mcL of product/cm²) intra-articularly implanted during arthrotomy. Each vial contains 4 million cells in 0.4 mL suspension.  This method still necessitates surgical preparation of the defect site, hemostasis, and the use of a biological membrane to seal the lesion.  Simple fibrin glue alone is insufficient.

The administration involves the careful surgical implantation of the cells into the prepared cartilage defect, typically secured using a periosteal flap and often involving a collagen membrane.  The procedure requires a surgeon trained in the specific techniques.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of autologous cultured chondrocytes have not been established in children and adolescents under 18 years old.  It is not recommended for this age group.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic or renal impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 5% of patients) may include:

* Arthrofibrosis (joint stiffness)
* Joint adhesions
* Graft overgrowth
* Chondromalacia (softening of cartilage)
* Chondrosis (cartilage degeneration)
* Cartilage injury
* Graft complications
* Meniscal lesion
* Graft delamination

Serious, though less common, side effects are possible.  Any adverse reaction should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Autologous cultured chondrocytes work by utilizing the patient's own chondrocytes (cartilage cells).  These cells are harvested from a healthy area of the patient's knee cartilage, then grown and multiplied in a laboratory setting.  The resulting expanded population of chondrocytes is surgically implanted into the damaged area of the knee cartilage.  The goal is for these cells to integrate into the defect and regenerate hyaline-like cartilage, thereby improving the structural integrity and function of the joint.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  This therapy is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to gentamicin or other aminoglycosides, materials of bovine origin, and in patients with an open femoral epiphyseal growth plate or advanced osteoarthritis.
* **Increased Risk:** There is an increased risk of transmitting infectious diseases.  Patients with a history of bone or joint infections should postpone treatment until fully recovered.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The therapy is not recommended during pregnancy due to the invasive surgical procedure. The effect on breastfeeding is unknown; a healthcare provider must weigh the risks and benefits.
* **Other Precautions:**  The therapy is not recommended for patients with total meniscectomy unless surgically reconstructed beforehand. The safety in patients with malignancy near the biopsy or implant site is unknown. Co-existing knee problems (like early osteoarthritis or instability) should be addressed before treatment.  Post-implantation, a structured rehabilitation program is crucial.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the treatment take?** A: The treatment involves multiple stages, starting with the cartilage biopsy, cell culture, and ending with the surgical implantation. The entire process can take several weeks or months.
* **Q: How long is the recovery period?** A: Recovery involves a structured rehabilitation program lasting about a year, including a period of protected weight-bearing.
* **Q: Are there any limitations after treatment?** A:  Physical activity may be limited during the recovery period as directed by the physician.
* **Q: Is this treatment suitable for everyone with knee cartilage damage?** A: No, this is a specific treatment for significant cartilage defects that haven’t responded to other treatments.  It's not suitable for generalized osteoarthritis or other knee conditions.
* **Q: What happens if there is an adverse reaction?** A: Any adverse effects should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.
* **Q: How is the treatment stored?** A:  This is a living cell product, handling and storage are strictly controlled to ensure viability.  Precise instructions will be provided by the healthcare provider and the manufacturer.
