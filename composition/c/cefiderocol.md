# Cefiderocol
### Generic Name
Cefiderocol

### Usage

Cefiderocol is a powerful antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections in adults (18 years and older) caused by susceptible Gram-negative bacteria.  Its primary use is for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs), including pyelonephritis (kidney infection), and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP).  These are infections often caused by bacteria resistant to many other antibiotics.  It's important to note that Cefiderocol is *not* recommended for routine use; it's reserved for infections caused by bacteria resistant to multiple other antibiotic classes, particularly carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and extensively drug-resistant *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.  A doctor will determine if Cefiderocol is the right treatment based on the specific bacteria causing the infection and its susceptibility to other antibiotics.

### Dosage

Cefiderocol is administered intravenously (IV). The dosage depends on several factors, including the type of infection, the patient's kidney function (creatinine clearance, or CrCl), and whether they are undergoing dialysis.  A healthcare professional will carefully determine the appropriate dose.

**Adults:**  The typical dose for cUTIs and HABP/VABP is 2 grams every 8 hours. However, this can be adjusted based on kidney function. For example, patients with a CrCl of ≥120 mL/min may receive a higher dose (2 grams every 6 hours).  Lower doses are given for those with impaired kidney function. Specific adjustments are needed for patients undergoing hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), with the dosage depending on the dialysis schedule and flow rate.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Cefiderocol in children under 18 have not been established.

**Important Note:**  The duration of treatment varies depending on the infection's severity and response to treatment; it's typically between 5-14 days for UTIs and around 7 days for pneumonia. A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate treatment duration.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Headache
* Insomnia
* Restlessness
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* Infusion-site reactions (at the injection site)
* Fever

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Seizures
*  Cardiovascular issues (e.g., atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, heart failure)
*  *Clostridioides difficile*-associated diarrhea (CDAD) – a serious intestinal infection
*  Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions, potentially severe)
* Increased liver enzymes
* Changes in blood counts

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Cefiderocol is a unique type of antibiotic called a siderophore cephalosporin.  It works in two key ways. First, the "siderophore" part of the molecule helps it get into Gram-negative bacteria, which have an outer membrane that is often difficult for antibiotics to penetrate. It does this by using the bacteria's own iron transport systems to enter the cell. Second, the "cephalosporin" part inhibits the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, leading to cell death and bacterial eradication.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Cefiderocol is contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity to Cefiderocol, other beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins), or any component of the formulation.  Patients with a history of penicillin or cephalosporin allergy should be carefully monitored.
* **Kidney Function:**  Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired kidney function.  Close monitoring of kidney function is crucial during treatment.
* **Seizures:**  Cefiderocol can increase the risk of seizures, especially in patients with a history of seizure disorders.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of Cefiderocol during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with a healthcare professional.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Potentially significant interactions with other medications are possible.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Increased Mortality:** Studies have shown a possible increased risk of mortality in critically ill patients with carbapenem-resistant infections treated with Cefiderocol. Close monitoring of the patient's response to treatment is crucial in such cases.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Cefiderocol administered?** A: It's administered intravenously (IV) by intermittent infusion over three hours.
* **Q: How long does treatment typically last?** A: The duration depends on the infection and response to treatment, ranging from 5-14 days for UTIs to about 7 days for pneumonia.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious or concerning.
* **Q: Can I take Cefiderocol if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: The safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established; consult your doctor.
* **Q: Can I store Cefiderocol at home?** A: No, Cefiderocol is administered in a hospital or clinical setting.
* **Q: Is Cefiderocol right for every bacterial infection?** A: No, it is specifically reserved for serious infections caused by multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria.  Your doctor will determine if it is appropriate for your infection.
