# Cefixime + Ornidazole + Lactobacillus

**Generic Name:** Cefixime + Ornidazole + Lactobacillus (This is a combination drug, so there isn't one single generic name for the combination.)

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat infections of the gastrointestinal tract that involve both bacterial and protozoal components.  Specifically, it's often prescribed for infections caused by bacteria susceptible to cefixime and protozoa susceptible to ornidazole. The lactobacillus component is added to help restore the balance of gut flora that can be disrupted by the antibiotics.  Common indications include:

* Bacterial dysentery (Shigellosis)
* Amoebic dysentery
* Other bacterial and protozoal infections of the gut

**Note:**  This medication is a prescription drug and should only be used as directed by a doctor.  The specific usage and dosage will depend on the individual patient and the type of infection.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Cefixime related:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, rash, allergic reactions (ranging from mild to severe, including anaphylaxis), changes in liver function tests.
* **Ornidazole related:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, metallic taste in the mouth, headache, dizziness, peripheral neuropathy (numbness or tingling in the extremities), rarely, seizures.
* **Lactobacillus related:** Generally well-tolerated, but some individuals may experience mild gastrointestinal upset.


**How it Works:**

* **Cefixime:**  This is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, leading to bacterial cell death. It's effective against a range of gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria.
* **Ornidazole:** This is a nitroimidazole antimicrobial drug effective against various protozoa and some anaerobic bacteria. It works by damaging the DNA of the target organisms, leading to their death.
* **Lactobacillus:** These are beneficial bacteria that help maintain a healthy gut microbiome. They compete with harmful bacteria, preventing their overgrowth and aiding in digestion.  Including them helps to reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, a common side effect of the antibiotics.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take this medication with alcohol?** A: No.  Alcohol should be avoided while taking ornidazole, as it can increase the risk of side effects.
* **Q: Can I take this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  This should only be taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding under strict medical supervision. The risks and benefits should be carefully weighed by a physician.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose.
* **Q: What if I experience severe side effects?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe allergic reactions (difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue), severe abdominal pain, or any other concerning symptoms.
* **Q: How long should I take this medication?** A: The duration of treatment will be determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and the severity of the infection.  Do not stop taking the medication prematurely, even if you feel better.
* **Q: Can I take other medications while taking this combination?** A: Inform your doctor about all other medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, to avoid potential drug interactions.
