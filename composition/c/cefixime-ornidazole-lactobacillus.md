# Cefixime + Ornidazole + Lactobacillus
### Generic Name
Cefixime + Ornidazole + Lactobacillus


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat bacterial and parasitic infections, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal tract.  Cefixime is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic effective against a broad range of Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria. Ornidazole is an antiprotozoal and antibacterial agent active against various anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, including *Giardia lamblia* and *Entamoeba histolytica*.  Lactobacillus is a probiotic included to help restore the balance of beneficial bacteria in the gut, which can be disrupted by antibiotics.  Therefore, this triple combination is frequently prescribed for infections like:

* **Infections of the gastrointestinal tract:** This includes bacterial dysentery, diarrhea caused by susceptible bacteria, and infections caused by *Entamoeba histolytica* (amoebiasis).
* **Infections complicated by bacterial overgrowth:** The antibiotic and antiprotozoal components tackle the infection while the probiotic helps prevent or reduce side effects like diarrhea and gut dysbiosis.


The specific infections treated may vary depending on the formulation and the physician's assessment.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation, the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the infection.  **It's crucial to follow the doctor's prescription precisely.**  There isn't a standard, universally applicable dosage.  The medication is usually administered orally.

* **Adults:** Dosage will be determined by the prescribing physician based on the infection being treated.  A common approach might involve taking the Cefixime and Ornidazole tablets together twice daily for a period determined by the doctor (typically 5-7 days), alongside a course of the Lactobacillus probiotic.
* **Children:**  Dosage for children is strictly based on weight and age.  This combination is generally not recommended for very young children (infants and toddlers) without specific physician guidance.  The probiotic may also require age-specific adjustments.  Never administer adult dosage to children.
* **IV Administration:** This combination is generally not available in an intravenous formulation. Cefixime and Ornidazole are available separately for IV administration in certain clinical situations but would require separate prescription and administration by a medical professional.


**Always consult a healthcare professional for precise dosage instructions.**


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea (although the probiotic aims to mitigate this)
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)


Less common but serious side effects can include:

* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (a serious complication of antibiotic use)
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Liver problems
* Blood disorders


If you experience any severe or persistent side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

This medication works through the combined action of its components:

* **Cefixime:** Interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.
* **Ornidazole:**  Disrupts the DNA of anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, preventing their growth and replication.
* **Lactobacillus:** Replenishes beneficial gut bacteria, reducing the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and promoting gut health.


The synergistic effect of these three components provides broader coverage against a wider range of pathogens and aids in gut microbiome restoration.


### Precautions

* **Allergic reactions:**  Prior to initiating treatment, inform your physician of any known allergies to cephalosporin antibiotics, nitroimidazoles, or any other components of the medication.
* **Drug interactions:**  This medication may interact with certain anticoagulants, alcohol, and other drugs.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Always consult your physician.
* **Liver and kidney disease:** Patients with liver or kidney impairment require careful monitoring during treatment, as the medication may need dose adjustment.
* **Alcohol consumption:**  Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment with Ornidazole, as this can lead to severe adverse effects.
* **Children:** This combination is not recommended for all children; consult a physician for guidance.
