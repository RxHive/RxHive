# Clevudine
### Generic Name
Clevudine

### Usage
Clevudine is primarily used to treat chronic hepatitis B.  Specifically, it's indicated for patients with chronic hepatitis B infection who show evidence of viral replication (meaning the virus is actively multiplying) and elevated levels of liver enzymes (transaminases), indicating liver damage.  Clevudine works by interfering with the hepatitis B virus's ability to replicate, thus helping to control the infection and reduce liver damage.  It's important to note that Clevudine is not a cure for hepatitis B; it's a treatment aimed at managing the infection long-term.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The standard oral dosage for chronic hepatitis B is 30 mg once daily.

**Children:** Clevudine is contraindicated (not to be used) in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with liver impairment.  However,  caution is advised, and close monitoring is necessary.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute),  the manufacturer's labeling doesn't offer specific dosage adjustments, but a dosage reduction might be needed due to the kidneys' role in eliminating the drug. Clevudine is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT and AST)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, from post-marketing surveillance and case reports):**  A wide range of side effects have been reported, including abdominal pain, allergic reactions, various liver problems (including hepatic failure), and various other symptoms affecting multiple organ systems.  This list is not exhaustive.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.  They can assess the severity of the side effects and determine if adjustments to treatment are needed.


### How it Works

Clevudine is a nucleoside analog, a type of drug that mimics natural building blocks of DNA. It works by inhibiting the hepatitis B virus (HBV) reverse transcriptase enzyme. This enzyme is crucial for the virus's replication cycle; by blocking it, Clevudine prevents the virus from making copies of itself, thereby reducing the viral load in the body and limiting the damage to the liver.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Clevudine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug or any of its components, those with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 mL/minute), and children under 18 years of age.
* **Warnings:** There's an increased risk of lactic acidosis (a buildup of lactic acid in the blood) and hepatomegaly with steatosis (enlarged liver with fatty changes).  Chronic hepatitis B exacerbations (worsening of the condition) can occur after stopping treatment.
* **Use with Caution:** Clevudine should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic impairment and those with mild renal impairment. Close monitoring is crucial in these cases.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Clevudine is not preferred during pregnancy.  It's unknown if the drug is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is not recommended while taking Clevudine.
* **Drug Interactions:** Orlistat may decrease the levels or effectiveness of Clevudine.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Clevudine with food?** A: Clevudine can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How long will I need to take Clevudine?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your individual response to the medication and is determined by your healthcare provider.  It's typically a long-term treatment.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't take two doses at once to make up for a missed dose.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist if uncertain about what to do.
* **Q: How should I store Clevudine?** A: Store Clevudine as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of taking Clevudine?** A: Long-term effects can vary and need close monitoring by your doctor,  including regular liver function tests and viral load monitoring.  Discuss any concerns with your healthcare professional.
