# Camphor
### Generic Name
Camphor

### Usage

Camphor is primarily used for its topical analgesic and antitussive properties.  It provides temporary relief from:

* **Cough:** Specifically, it's used for the temporary relief of coughs associated with the common cold.  It's important to note that camphor is not intended for persistent or chronic coughs, such as those caused by smoking, emphysema, or asthma, or for coughs that produce phlegm (productive coughs).

* **Muscle and Joint Pain:** Camphor offers temporary relief from minor aches and pains in muscles and joints related to conditions like arthritis, simple backache, muscle sprains, strains, and bruises.

* **Skin Irritation:**  Topically, camphor can temporarily relieve pain and itching associated with minor burns, sunburn, minor cuts, scrapes, insect bites, minor skin irritations, and rashes caused by poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the product formulation (cream, gel, vaporizer solution) and the intended use.  Always follow the instructions on the product label carefully.

**Adults:**

* **Cough (Inhalation):**  Vaporizer solutions (typically 6.2% camphor) are used via inhalation up to three times daily.  Follow the specific instructions provided with the vaporizer.

* **Pain (Topical):** Creams (typically 3.1% camphor) are applied to the affected area up to four times daily. For optimal results, daily application for at least two weeks is recommended, and continued use as needed thereafter.

* **Pruritus/Pain (Topical):** Gels (typically 0.45% camphor) are applied to the affected area three to four times daily.


**Children:**

Dosage for children varies greatly depending on age and the specific product.  **Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before giving camphor to a child.**  Generally:

* **Cough (Inhalation):** Vaporizer solutions may be used in children aged 2 years and older, but always dilute with water according to the product instructions.
* **Pain (Topical):** Topical creams are typically contraindicated in children under 12 years of age.
* **Pruritus/Pain (Topical):** Gels may be used in children aged 2 years and older, following the adult dosage guidelines.

**Note:**  The above information is a general guide. Always refer to the specific product labeling for precise dosage instructions.


### Side Effects

Generally, camphor is well-tolerated when used as directed.  However, some individuals may experience:

* **Skin irritation:** This is more likely with prolonged or excessive use.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare, but possible, including rash, itching, or swelling.

**Serious side effects are rare but can occur if camphor is ingested accidentally.  Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect ingestion of camphor.**


### How it Works

Camphor's mechanism of action differs depending on its use:

* **Topical analgesic:** Camphor appears to stimulate nerve endings in the skin, leading to a feeling of coolness and counter-irritation, which can help relieve pain and itching.

* **Antitussive:** Camphor's exact mechanism in cough suppression is not fully understood, but it's believed to have a mild effect on the respiratory system, helping to reduce cough frequency.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Do not apply camphor to broken, damaged, or irritated skin.  Topical camphor is generally contraindicated in children under 12 years of age.

* **Drug Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known, but always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Avoid using camphor during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

* **Other warnings:** Camphor is flammable. Keep away from open flames. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.  If accidentally ingested, seek immediate medical attention.
