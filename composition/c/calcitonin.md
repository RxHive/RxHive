# Calcitonin
### Generic Name
Calcitonin-salmon

### Usage
Calcitonin-salmon is primarily used to treat symptomatic Paget's disease of bone when other treatments aren't suitable.  It's also used to manage hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) and postmenopausal osteoporosis in women who have been postmenopausal for more than five years, again when other treatments are unsuitable.  In children, it may be used to treat osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease), although this is less common.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Patients with osteoporosis or Paget's disease often need supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is insufficient.  A healthcare provider will determine if supplementation is necessary.

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration (injection or nasal spray), and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

* **Hypercalcemia (Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Injection):**  The initial dose is typically 4 units/kg every 12 hours.  If this isn't effective after 24-48 hours, the dose might be increased to 8 units/kg every 12 hours, and potentially further to 8 units/kg every 6 hours if necessary.  The effect diminishes after 24-48 hours.

* **Osteoporosis (Postmenopausal Women - Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Injection):**  The usual dose is 100 units/day.  For nasal spray administration, the dose is 200 units (one spray) in one nostril daily.

* **Paget's Disease (Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Injection):**  A typical starting dose is 100 units/day.  Lower maintenance doses (e.g., 50 units three times a week) may be sufficient depending on individual response.

* **Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Children - Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Injection):**  In children older than 6 months, the dosage is typically 2 units/kg three times per week.

**Administration:**  Intramuscular (IM) injections are preferred if the volume is greater than 2 mL.  Subcutaneous (SubQ) injections are generally suitable for smaller volumes and are preferable for self-administration at home.  For the nasal spray, prime the pump before the first use and alternate nostrils daily.  Discard the spray after 30 doses.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal mucous membrane)
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) potentially leading to tetany (muscle spasms) and seizures.
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis)
* Bronchospasm
* Malignancy (although a causal link isn't definitively established)


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly severe ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.  This list isn't exhaustive, and other side effects are possible.

### How it Works

Calcitonin-salmon is a synthetic form of a hormone similar to human calcitonin.  It works by counteracting the effects of parathyroid hormone, which is involved in calcium regulation.  Specifically, calcitonin-salmon directly reduces the activity of osteoclasts (cells that break down bone), thereby decreasing bone resorption (loss of bone tissue). It also enhances the excretion of calcium, phosphate, and other minerals in the urine.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Calcitonin-salmon is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to calcitonin-salmon or any of its components.

* **Drug Interactions:** Calcitonin-salmon can interact with certain medications, including lithium and zoledronic acid.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Calcitonin-salmon is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are unknown.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.

* **Other Precautions:**  Regular monitoring of blood calcium levels is necessary, especially during the initial stages of treatment.  Patients should be aware of the potential for allergic reactions and should seek immediate medical attention if such a reaction occurs.  Renal function should be assessed periodically.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The response time varies depending on the condition.  For hypercalcemia, effects may be seen relatively quickly.  For osteoporosis, changes in bone density may take longer to assess.


* **Q: How should I store calcitonin-salmon?** A: Store as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.  Typically, this involves keeping it at a controlled room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I stop taking calcitonin-salmon suddenly?** A: No, do not stop taking calcitonin-salmon abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping suddenly could potentially lead to worsening of your condition.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.


* **Q: Is calcitonin-salmon addictive?** A: No, calcitonin-salmon is not considered an addictive medication.
