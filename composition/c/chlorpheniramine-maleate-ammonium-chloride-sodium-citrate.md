# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used as an expectorant and antihistamine to treat the symptoms of the common cold or upper respiratory allergies.  Specifically:

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  An antihistamine that reduces runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
* **Ammonium Chloride:** An expectorant that helps loosen mucus and phlegm, making it easier to cough up.
* **Sodium Citrate:** Acts as a buffer to help maintain the proper pH for the ammonium chloride to function effectively.  It also helps to thin the mucus.


**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect of chlorpheniramine.
* **Dry mouth:**  Both the antihistamine and the expectorant can contribute to this.
* **Constipation:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Headache:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Blurred vision:**
* **Restlessness or excitability (especially in children):**  Particularly paradoxical effects can occur with higher doses.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, serious allergic reactions are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat; difficulty breathing; or hives.


**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This antihistamine works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  By blocking histamine, it reduces the symptoms associated with allergies.
* **Ammonium Chloride:** This expectorant works by increasing the amount of water in the respiratory tract. This helps thin the mucus, making it easier to cough up. The sodium citrate assists in this process.
