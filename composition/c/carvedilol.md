# Carvedilol
### Generic Name
Carvedilol

### Usage
Carvedilol is a medication primarily used to treat several cardiovascular conditions.  Its main applications include:

* **Chronic heart failure (CHF):** Carvedilol helps improve the symptoms and survival rate in patients with mild to severe CHF by reducing the workload on the heart.
* **Left ventricular dysfunction (post-myocardial infarction):** Following a heart attack, the left ventricle (the heart's main pumping chamber) may weaken. Carvedilol helps improve its function and reduces the risk of future heart events.
* **Hypertension (high blood pressure):** Carvedilol helps lower blood pressure, reducing the strain on the circulatory system and decreasing the risk of complications like stroke and heart attack.

While not its primary use, Carvedilol is sometimes used off-label for chronic stable angina (chest pain).


### Dosage

Carvedilol comes in both immediate-release and extended-release formulations.  **Crucially, these are not interchangeable on a milligram-for-milligram basis.** Dosage must be individualized and carefully monitored by a healthcare professional.  Titration (gradual increase in dose) is generally recommended to minimize side effects.

**Adult Dosage (Immediate-Release):**

* **Heart Failure:**  Start at a very low dose (3.125 mg twice daily) and gradually increase as tolerated. The maximum dose varies depending on the severity of heart failure and patient weight.
* **Post-MI Left Ventricular Dysfunction:**  Start with a low dose (3.125â€“6.25 mg twice daily) and increase incrementally. The maximum is usually 25 mg twice daily.
* **Hypertension:** Initial dose is typically 6.25 mg twice daily, adjusted as needed. The maximum is usually 25 mg twice daily.

**Adult Dosage (Extended-Release):**

Dosages are generally higher than with immediate-release, but again, start low and increase gradually under medical supervision.  Maximum doses are generally 80 mg daily.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of carvedilol in children under 18 years of age have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with liver or kidney problems.  Patients with severe liver impairment should not use carvedilol.  Renal impairment generally does not require dose adjustments.  Precise adjustments should be determined by a physician considering individual patient factors.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Headache

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* AV block (heart conduction problems)
* Bronchospasm (wheezing)
* Worsening of heart failure
* Liver problems
* Allergic reactions (including rash, itching, swelling)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe or unusual ones, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Carvedilol is a beta-blocker and alpha-blocker.  It works in two ways:

1. **Beta-blockade:** It blocks the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) on the heart, leading to a slower heart rate and reduced force of contraction.  This reduces the heart's workload and blood pressure.
2. **Alpha-blockade:** It also blocks alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), further reducing peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure.

By lowering heart rate, blood pressure, and reducing the heart's workload, carvedilol helps manage heart failure, post-MI left ventricular dysfunction, and hypertension.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Carvedilol is contraindicated in patients with severe liver disease, certain types of heart block, severe bradycardia, bronchial asthma, and some other conditions.  Always inform your doctor about all health conditions.
* **Drug Interactions:** Carvedilol can interact with many other drugs, including other heart medications, insulin, and certain antidepressants.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Carvedilol is a Category C pregnancy drug, meaning its safety in pregnancy is not fully established.  The decision to use it during pregnancy should be made carefully by your doctor, weighing the benefits and risks.  It's not known whether carvedilol is excreted in breast milk.
* **Specific populations:** Older adults, patients with diabetes, and individuals with respiratory problems need to be monitored closely when taking carvedilol.  The risk of side effects is higher.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking carvedilol suddenly?**  A: No, you should never stop taking carvedilol abruptly.  Stopping it suddenly can worsen your condition and potentially cause serious complications.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually tapering the dose.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking carvedilol?** A: Alcohol can interact with carvedilol and increase the risk of side effects, especially low blood pressure.  Limit alcohol consumption or avoid it completely while on this medication.

* **Q: How should I store carvedilol?** A: Store carvedilol as directed on the label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Is carvedilol habit-forming?** A: No, carvedilol is not a habit-forming medication.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any side effects, especially serious ones.  Your doctor may need to adjust your dosage or recommend alternative treatment.  Never self-treat side effects.
