# Chlorphenoxamine
### Generic Name
Chlorphenoxamine

### Usage
Chlorphenoxamine is primarily an antihistamine and anticholinergic drug.  Its main use is in treating allergic conditions, providing relief from itching and other allergic symptoms like those associated with hives (urticaria), eczema, insect bites, and sunburn. Historically, it has also been used in treating Parkinsonism, although this application is less common now.  It's crucial to understand that while it can help with itching, chlorphenoxamine does not address the underlying cause of the allergy.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the form of medication (cream or oral).  Precise dosage instructions should always come from a healthcare professional.  This information is for general knowledge only and should not be taken as a prescription.


**Adult Dosage:**

* **Allergic Conditions (Oral):** 20-40 mg twice or three times daily (BID or TID).
* **Allergic Conditions (Intramuscular or Intravenous):** 10 mg once or twice daily (OD or BID).
* **Topical (Cream):** Apply a 1.5% cream to the affected area several times a day as needed.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

Oral use in children is generally not recommended.  For topical use (cream), a 5% cream can be applied to affected areas. However, applying it to large areas in infants and children should be avoided because of potential systemic absorption.  Always consult a pediatrician before using chlorphenoxamine on children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. Safety and efficacy in these situations have not been established.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Drowsiness or sedation
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Blurred vision
* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Palpitations
* Difficulty urinating

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (such as rash, hives, swelling)
* Seizures
* Hallucinations
* Irregular heartbeat
* Low blood pressure
* Blood disorders (rare)

**If you experience any adverse effects, stop taking chlorphenoxamine and seek immediate medical advice.**


### How it Works

Chlorphenoxamine works by blocking histamine receptors (H1 receptors) in the body. Histamine is a chemical released during allergic reactions, causing itching, inflammation, and other symptoms. By blocking these receptors, chlorphenoxamine reduces the effects of histamine and relieves allergy symptoms.  Additionally, it possesses anticholinergic properties, meaning it also blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in various bodily functions including those affecting the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Chlorphenoxamine is contraindicated (should not be used) during the first trimester of pregnancy and during breastfeeding.  The safety in later stages of pregnancy is not fully established.
* **Interactions with other drugs:** Chlorphenoxamine may interact with MAO inhibitors and other central nervous system depressants, potentially intensifying their effects.  Consult a doctor about all medications you're taking before starting chlorphenoxamine.
* **Conditions to be cautious with:** Use caution in individuals with acute narrow-angle glaucoma, as chlorphenoxamine's anticholinergic effects can worsen this condition.
* **Allergy:** Avoid chlorphenoxamine if you have a known allergy to parabens or cetylstearyl alcohol, common ingredients in cream formulations.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking chlorphenoxamine?** A: No, alcohol can increase the sedative effects of chlorphenoxamine and should be avoided.
* **Q: How should I store chlorphenoxamine?** A: Store chlorphenoxamine according to the instructions on the label, usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: Is chlorphenoxamine habit-forming?** A: Chlorphenoxamine is not generally considered habit-forming, but prolonged use should be supervised by a physician.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Can chlorphenoxamine cause drowsiness?** A: Yes, drowsiness is a common side effect. Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how chlorphenoxamine affects you.
