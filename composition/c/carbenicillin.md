# Carbenicillin

**Generic Name:** Carbenicillin

**Usage:** Carbenicillin is a broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, particularly those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria resistant to other penicillins. It's often used in serious infections where other antibiotics have failed or are ineffective.  Specific uses may include:

* Severe urinary tract infections
* Septicemia (bloodstream infections)
* Pneumonia
* Meningitis (in certain cases)
* Infections of the skin and soft tissues
* Gynecological infections


**Side Effects:**  Like all antibiotics, carbenicillin can cause side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  These include:

* **Common:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, rash, itching.
* **Less Common:**  Elevated liver enzymes, changes in blood counts (e.g., neutropenia),  inflammation of the colon (pseudomembranous colitis - a potentially serious complication),  vaginal yeast infections (candidiasis).
* **Rare but Serious:**  Allergic reactions (ranging from hives to anaphylaxis – a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention), seizures (especially in patients with renal impairment), kidney problems (including interstitial nephritis).


**How it Works:** Carbenicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic.  It works by inhibiting the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  This disruption weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to cell lysis (rupture) and bacterial death.  Carbenicillin has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, but its activity against gram-positive bacteria is limited.


**FAQs:**

* **Is carbenicillin still used?** While newer, broader-spectrum antibiotics are often preferred, carbenicillin remains a treatment option for serious infections caused by certain resistant bacteria, especially when other antibiotics fail.  Its use is less common than in the past.

* **How is carbenicillin administered?** Carbenicillin is typically administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM).  Oral formulations are generally less effective due to poor absorption.

* **What are the drug interactions?** Carbenicillin can interact with other medications, including aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin, tobramycin) – sometimes synergistically (enhancing their effectiveness), but potentially also increasing nephrotoxicity (kidney damage).  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

* **What are the contraindications?** Patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to penicillin antibiotics should not take carbenicillin.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  If you experience any side effects, particularly severe ones, you should contact your doctor immediately.
