# Calcium Chloride
### Generic Name
Calcium Chloride

### Usage

Calcium chloride is primarily used to treat hypocalcemia, a condition characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood.  Hypocalcemia can lead to a variety of symptoms, including muscle spasms (tetany), seizures, and abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Calcium chloride rapidly replenishes calcium levels, alleviating these symptoms.  It's crucial to understand that calcium chloride is typically administered intravenously (IV) in emergency situations due to its rapid onset of action.  Less commonly, calcium chloride serves as an emergency treatment for severe hypermagnesemia (high magnesium levels in the blood), where it helps counteract the effects of magnesium on the heart and nervous system.  Oral calcium supplements are also used for hypocalcemia but lack the speed of intravenous calcium chloride.

### Dosage

Dosage of calcium chloride varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (IV).  The information below should not be considered medical advice and should be used only in conjunction with a physician's prescription and guidance.  Always consult a healthcare professional before administering any medication.  Precise dosing instructions are critical due to the potential for serious side effects from both underdosing and overdosing.


**Adult Dosage (IV):**

* **Cardiac arrest or cardiotoxicity:**  500-1000 mg over 2-5 minutes, repeated as needed.  However, routine use in cardiac arrest isn't recommended due to a lack of proven survival benefit.
* **Acute, symptomatic hypocalcemia:** 200-1000 mg every 1-3 days.
* **Severe, symptomatic hypocalcemia (seizures, tetany):** 1000 mg over 10 minutes, repeated every 60 minutes until symptoms resolve.

**Pediatric Dosage (IV):**  Dosage is highly individualized based on the child's weight and specific condition.  Pediatric dosing should only be determined by a physician.

* **Daily maintenance:** The dose is calculated in milliequivalents (mEq) per kilogram (kg) of body weight per day, varying depending on the child's weight.
* **Hypocalcemia:**  The dose is expressed in milligrams (mg) of calcium chloride per kilogram (kg) of body weight per dose, administered every 4-6 hours.  Maximum doses are typically specified to avoid toxicity.
* **Tetany:**  A specific dose per kilogram is given intravenously, potentially repeated after 6 hours and/or followed by a continuous infusion.
* **Cardiac arrest:** The PALS (Pediatric Advanced Life Support) guidelines recommend a specific dose, which may be repeated if necessary.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  These side effects are not exhaustive and are not necessarily indicative of all possible reactions.
* **Cardiovascular (following rapid IV injection):** Bradycardia (slow heart rate), cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension (low blood pressure), syncope (fainting), vasodilation.
* **Nervous System:**  Abnormal sensations (oppression, tingling).
* **Endocrine and Metabolic:** Hot flashes, hypercalcemia (high blood calcium).
* **Gastrointestinal:** Dysgeusia (metallic taste), gastrointestinal irritation, increased serum amylase levels.
* **Local:** Local tissue necrosis (death of tissue) from extravasation (leakage from the vein).
* **Renal:** Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones).

**Less Common but Serious:** Cutaneous calcification (calcium deposits in the skin).

**Note:** Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Calcium chloride works by directly increasing the level of calcium ions in the bloodstream. Calcium plays a vital role in numerous bodily functions, including muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and blood clotting.  In hypocalcemia, the lack of sufficient calcium ions disrupts these processes, causing symptoms like muscle spasms and arrhythmias. Calcium chloride rapidly replenishes the calcium ion deficiency, restoring normal function.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Calcium chloride is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected digoxin toxicity.  Routine use in cardiac arrest is not advised.
* **Interactions:**  Calcium chloride may interact with thiazide diuretics (increasing the risk of hypercalcemia), digoxin (potentiating toxicity), calcium channel blockers (reducing their effectiveness), and calcitriol (enhancing calcium absorption).
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with renal impairment (kidney disease), hypokalemia (low potassium), respiratory acidosis (increased acidity of the blood), and hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate).  Extravasation can cause severe tissue damage; intravenous administration requires careful monitoring.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** While calcium crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk, the risk-benefit of use during pregnancy and lactation needs careful evaluation by the physician.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take calcium chloride orally?** A:  While oral calcium supplements exist, intravenous calcium chloride is used in emergency situations for rapid calcium replenishment. Oral forms are typically used for long-term management of mild hypocalcemia.
* **Q: How is calcium chloride stored?** A:  Store according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically at room temperature. Protect from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Immediately report any new or worsening symptoms to a healthcare provider.
* **Q: Is calcium chloride safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use is not generally recommended without careful monitoring due to the potential for serious side effects.  The decision to utilize calcium chloride for extended durations must be made by a healthcare professional.
* **Q: Can calcium chloride be given to children?** A:  Yes, but only under a doctor's supervision and with carefully calculated pediatric dosages.
