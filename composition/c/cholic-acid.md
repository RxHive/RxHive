# Cholic Acid
### Generic Name
Cholic Acid

### Usage
Cholic acid is primarily used to treat bile acid synthesis disorders resulting from single-enzyme defects (SEDs).  It's also used adjunctively in the treatment of peroxisomal disorders (PDs), such as Zellweger spectrum disorders.  This is particularly in cases where patients show signs of liver disease like steatorrhea (difficulty absorbing fats, leading to fatty stools) or complications from poor absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).  It's important to note that the effectiveness of cholic acid in treating extrahepatic (outside the liver) manifestations of these bile acid synthesis disorders isn't fully established.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For bile acid synthesis disorders (SEDs) or as an adjunct in peroxisomal disorders (PDs), the recommended oral dose is 10-15 mg/kg daily, either as a single dose or divided into two doses.  For patients with concurrent familial hypertriglyceridemia (high levels of triglycerides in the blood), a slightly higher dose of 11-17 mg/kg daily may be used, adjusted based on the patient's response (improvement in steatorrhea, liver enzyme levels, bilirubin, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR)).


**Children:**  For children aged 3 weeks to 18 years with SEDs or as an adjunct in PDs, the recommended oral dose is also 10-15 mg/kg daily, given as a single dose or divided into two doses. Again, for those with familial hypertriglyceridemia, a dose of 11-17 mg/kg daily might be necessary, with adjustments based on clinical response and laboratory values.  Cholic acid's safety and efficacy haven't been established for children under 3 weeks old.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dose adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, for hepatic impairment, treatment should be stopped if liver function doesn't improve within three months of starting cholic acid.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Cholestasis (reduced bile flow)
* Increased serum bilirubin levels
* Increased serum transaminase levels (liver enzymes)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities)
* Skin lesions
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Intestinal polyps
* Nausea
* Reflux esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus)
* Urinary tract infection
* Hepatic disease
* Jaundice


If you experience any adverse effects, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Cholic acid and its conjugates are natural bile acids that act as ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor involved in regulating bile acid synthesis and enterohepatic circulation (the cycling of bile acids between the liver and intestines). By interacting with FXR, cholic acid helps maintain bile acid homeostasis (balance), which is disrupted in the conditions it treats.

### Precautions

* **Interactions:** Cholic acid's effects can be altered by certain medications.  Inhibitors of bile salt efflux pump (BSEP), such as cyclosporine, and other drugs that inhibit bile acid transporters in the liver can worsen bile acid accumulation, potentially causing symptoms. If cholic acid is used concurrently with these medications, close monitoring of liver function (transaminases and bilirubin) is vital.  Bile acid-binding resins (cholestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam) and aluminum-based antacids can reduce cholic acid's absorption.  These should be taken at least one hour before or 4-6 hours after cholic acid administration.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with liver problems.  Discontinue if liver function doesn't improve within three months.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of cholic acid during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not established.  Cholic acid is naturally present in breast milk.
* **General:** Capsules should not be crushed or chewed. For those who can't swallow capsules, the contents can be mixed with food or drink.  For pediatric patients, mix the contents with infant formula, breast milk, or soft food.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I crush or chew cholic acid capsules?** A: No, this is not recommended.  
* **Q: How should I store cholic acid?** A:  Store as directed on the product label, usually in a cool, dry place.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose.
* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking cholic acid?** A: Consult your healthcare provider for personalized dietary recommendations.
* **Q: How long will it take to see results?** A:  The time it takes to see improvements varies depending on the individual and their condition.  Regular monitoring and follow-up with your healthcare provider are crucial.
