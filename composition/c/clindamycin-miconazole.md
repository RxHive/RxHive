# Clindamycin + Miconazole

**Generic Name:** Clindamycin + Miconazole

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical treatment for bacterial and fungal infections of the skin.  It's commonly used to treat acne vulgaris that is also complicated by a yeast infection (such as *Candida*), or other mixed skin infections where both bacteria and fungi are involved.  Specific indications vary depending on the formulation (cream, lotion, etc.) and the country of registration.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions for use.  It is *not* for oral or intravenous use.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include burning, stinging, redness, dryness, or irritation at the application site. Less common but more serious side effects are possible, though rare. These might include allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), severe skin reactions, or changes in skin pigmentation.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, discontinue use and consult a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**  Clindamycin is an antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, thus preventing bacterial growth. Miconazole is an antifungal medication that inhibits the growth of fungi by interfering with the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.  The combination provides broad-spectrum activity against both bacteria and fungi, making it effective for mixed infections.
