# Calcium Citrate Malate + Vitamin D + Vitamin K + Methylcobalamin + Magnesium Oxide + Zinc Oxide

**Generic Name:** Calcium Citrate Malate + Vitamin D + Vitamin K + Methylcobalamin + Magnesium Oxide + Zinc Oxide  (Note:  This is a combination product, not one generic name).  Each ingredient has its own generic name (e.g., Calcium citrate malate, Cholecalciferol for Vitamin D3, Phylloquinone for Vitamin K1, etc.).

**Usage:** This combination supplement is often marketed to support bone health, improve calcium absorption, and address potential deficiencies in various micronutrients.  The specific indications may vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation, but common uses include:

* **Bone health:** Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin K, and Magnesium all play crucial roles in bone health, supporting bone density and reducing the risk of osteoporosis.
* **Muscle function:** Magnesium and Calcium are essential for muscle contractions and relaxation. Methylcobalamin (a form of Vitamin B12) is vital for nerve function, impacting muscle function indirectly.
* **Immune system support:** Zinc plays a vital role in immune function.
* **General health and wellbeing:**  The combined nutrients contribute to overall health and may help to mitigate deficiencies.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild but can occur depending on the dosage and individual sensitivity.  They may include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, stomach upset (especially with higher doses of calcium or magnesium).
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but possible, especially if allergic to any of the ingredients.
* **Other potential side effects:**  Headache, fatigue, metallic taste (zinc), increased thirst (magnesium) are less common.
* **Interactions with medications:**  This supplement can interact with certain medications, particularly those affecting calcium, magnesium, or vitamin D metabolism (e.g., some antibiotics, diuretics, heart medications). Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you're on any medications.

**How it Works:** Each component works independently and synergistically to contribute to the overall benefits:

* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** Provides readily absorbable calcium for bone health and other bodily functions.  The "malate" form is often preferred for better absorption.
* **Vitamin D:**  Essential for calcium absorption from the gut and for bone mineralization.
* **Vitamin K:**  Plays a critical role in bone metabolism, activating proteins involved in bone formation.
* **Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):**  Important for nerve function and red blood cell formation, indirectly supporting muscle health.
* **Magnesium Oxide:**  Essential for muscle function, bone health, and many metabolic processes.
* **Zinc Oxide:**  Supports the immune system and plays a role in various enzymatic reactions.
