# Clobetasol + Salicylic Acid

**Generic Name:** Clobetasol Propionate + Salicylic Acid

**Usage:**

This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid (clobetasol propionate) and a keratolytic agent (salicylic acid). It's prescribed to treat various skin conditions characterized by inflammation, scaling, and thickening of the skin.  Common uses include:

* **Psoriasis:**  Especially plaque psoriasis.
* **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis):**  In moderate to severe cases.
* **Lichen Planus:** A chronic inflammatory skin condition.
* **Seborrheic Dermatitis:**  A skin condition causing scaly patches, often on the scalp, face, and chest.
* **Other inflammatory skin conditions:**  As directed by a physician.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness, dryness.
* **Thinning of the skin (skin atrophy):**  Especially with prolonged use.
* **Stretch marks (striae):**  May occur with long-term use.
* **Purpura:** Bruising of the skin.
* **Telangiectasia:**  Visible dilation of small blood vessels.
* **Acne:**  Increased breakouts.
* **Hives:**  An allergic reaction.

Less common, but more serious side effects, can include:

* **Skin infections:**  Increased risk due to impaired skin barrier function.
* **Cushing's syndrome:**  A rare but serious hormonal disorder, more likely with extensive use or overuse.
* **Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar):**  More likely with extensive use or overuse.


**How it Works:**

* **Clobetasol propionate:**  A potent corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune system's response in the skin.
* **Salicylic acid:** A keratolytic agent that helps to soften and remove scales and thickened skin, improving penetration of the corticosteroid and aiding in the treatment of the underlying condition.  The combination works synergistically to provide more effective treatment than either ingredient alone.
