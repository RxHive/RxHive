# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Trithioparamethoxy Phenylpropene
I cannot find a registered medication containing both Chlorpheniramine Maleate and Trithioparamethoxy Phenylpropene as combined active ingredients.  It's possible:

* **The name "Trithioparamethoxy Phenylpropene" is not a standard or commonly used pharmaceutical name.**  Chemical names can be long and complex; there might be a simpler, more commonly used name for this compound.  You may need to provide additional information, such as the brand name or a more concise chemical description.
* **The combination is not approved.**  Many combinations of drugs are tested, but not all make it to market. This particular combination might not have shown sufficient efficacy or safety in clinical trials.
* **There's a typographical error.**  A slight misspelling could significantly change the compound's identity.

To provide you with the accurate information you need, please double-check the spelling of the second ingredient or provide any additional details you have about the medication, such as the brand name or the intended use.  With more information, I can access reliable pharmaceutical databases to give you the comprehensive details you requested.
