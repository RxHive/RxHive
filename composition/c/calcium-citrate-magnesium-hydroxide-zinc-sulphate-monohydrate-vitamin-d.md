# Calcium citrate + Magnesium Hydroxide + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Vitamin D

**Generic Name:**  Calcium Citrate + Magnesium Hydroxide + Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate + Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol)  *(Note:  The specific salts and forms of these ingredients may vary slightly between brands.  Monohydrate specifies the form of Zinc Sulfate.)*


**Usage:** This combination supplement is typically used to address or prevent deficiencies in calcium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D.  It's often recommended for:

* **Osteoporosis prevention and treatment:** Calcium and vitamin D are crucial for bone health. Magnesium also plays a supporting role.
* **Bone health in general:**  Maintaining strong bones throughout life.
* **Improving immune function:** Zinc and vitamin D are important for a healthy immune system.
* **Supporting muscle function:** Calcium and magnesium are vital for muscle contractions.
* **Managing certain medical conditions:**  In some cases, a doctor may prescribe this combination to address specific deficiencies related to conditions like hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypozincemia.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, upset stomach. These are more common with higher doses and can be reduced by taking the supplement with food.
* **Kidney stones:** In individuals predisposed to kidney stones, high calcium intake can increase the risk.
* **Hypercalcemia:**  (High blood calcium) – rare but serious, characterized by symptoms like fatigue, weakness, confusion, and kidney problems.  Requires immediate medical attention.
* **Hypermagnesemia:** (High blood magnesium) – rare but can cause nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, and low blood pressure.
* **Zinc toxicity:**  While rare at recommended dosages, excessive zinc can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps.
* **Vitamin D toxicity:**  Rare but can lead to hypercalcemia and other serious issues.


**How it Works:**

* **Calcium Citrate:**  A readily absorbed form of calcium, essential for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth, muscle function, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.
* **Magnesium Hydroxide:** A form of magnesium that aids in calcium absorption, supports bone health, muscle function, and nerve function.  It also acts as an antacid.
* **Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate:**  Provides zinc, an essential mineral involved in immune function, wound healing, cell growth, and protein synthesis.
* **Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol):**  Essential for calcium absorption and bone metabolism.  It also plays a role in immune function.

The combination works synergistically, meaning the individual components enhance each other's effects on bone health and overall well-being.
