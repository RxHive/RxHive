# Clomiphene
### Generic Name
Clomiphene

### Usage
Clomiphene is primarily used to treat ovulatory dysfunction in women who are trying to conceive.  It's a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), meaning it acts like estrogen in some parts of the body and blocks estrogen in others. This unique action stimulates the pituitary gland to release more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are crucial for the development and release of eggs from the ovaries (ovulation).  While its primary use is for infertility treatment, it's not used in all cases of infertility.  It's specifically indicated for women with anovulation (absence of ovulation) or oligoovulation (infrequent ovulation) who haven't responded to other treatments.


### Dosage
Clomiphene is typically administered orally.  The dosage is individualized and depends on the patient's response and overall health.

**Adult Dosage (Ovulation Induction):**

* **Initial Course:** The usual starting dose is 50 mg once daily for 5 days, beginning around day 5 of the menstrual cycle (if there is a regular cycle).  If ovulation doesn't occur, the dose might be increased to 100 mg once daily for 5 days in subsequent cycles.  Lower doses (12.5-25 mg daily) may be used in women who are sensitive to clomiphene or who develop large ovarian cysts.

* **Repeat Courses:** If necessary, the 5-day course can be repeated after a minimum of 30 days, only after excluding pregnancy.  The lowest effective dose should always be used. The maximum recommended dose is 100 mg once daily for 5 days, for a maximum of six cycles. Treatment should be discontinued if ovulation doesn't occur after three cycles or if three ovulatory responses are achieved without pregnancy.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Clomiphene is not recommended for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Clomiphene is contraindicated in patients with liver disease or a history of liver dysfunction.
* **Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustment is needed for patients with kidney problems, according to the manufacturer's information.


### Side Effects
Clomiphene can cause various side effects, ranging from mild to serious.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Ovarian enlargement

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Hot flashes
* Abdominal distention, bloating, nausea, vomiting
* Visual disturbances (blurred vision, light sensitivity)
* Breast tenderness or pain
* Abnormal uterine bleeding


**Rare but Serious Side Effects (occurring in less than 1% of patients):**

* Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) - a potentially life-threatening condition
* Multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.)
* Visual disturbances that may persist
* Thromboembolism
* Allergic reactions


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Clomiphene works by binding to estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. This action interferes with the normal feedback mechanism that regulates the release of gonadotropins (FSH and LH). By disrupting this feedback, clomiphene stimulates the pituitary gland to release more FSH and LH, triggering follicle growth in the ovaries and ultimately leading to ovulation.


### Precautions
Several precautions should be considered before using clomiphene:

* **Contraindications:** Clomiphene is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, pregnancy, liver disease, abnormal uterine bleeding of unknown cause, ovarian cysts (except those related to PCOS), uncontrolled thyroid or adrenal disorders, pituitary tumors, hormone-dependent tumors, and a history of thrombophlebitis.

* **Interactions:**  Clomiphene can interact with other medications, particularly those affecting hormone levels.  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor.  Avoid concurrent use with ospemifene due to increased synergistic effects.

* **Warnings:**  Clomiphene carries a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), multiple pregnancies, and visual disturbances.  Patients should be closely monitored during treatment.  The risk of OHSS is increased in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).  The drug is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Lactation may be suppressed.

* **Specific Populations:**  Careful consideration is needed when prescribing clomiphene to women with uterine fibroids or those who are unusually sensitive to pituitary gonadotropins.  Pre-existing fibroids may increase in size.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Clomiphene?**  A: Ovulation typically occurs within 5-10 days after the completion of a course of Clomiphene.  However,  pregnancy may take longer to achieve.

* **Q: Can I take Clomiphene if I'm breastfeeding?** A:  While excretion in breast milk is unknown, use during breastfeeding is generally advised against due to the potential for suppression of lactation. Discuss this with your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor immediately for instructions. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store Clomiphene?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: Is Clomiphene safe for long-term use?**  A:  No, prolonged use of clomiphene is not recommended. The treatment course is usually limited to a few cycles.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate duration of treatment.
