# Clomiphene

**Generic Name:** Clomiphene Citrate

**Usage:** Clomiphene citrate is primarily used to treat infertility in women by stimulating ovulation.  It's also sometimes used off-label in certain situations like inducing spermatogenesis in men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.  The most common use, however, remains ovulation induction in women with anovulatory infertility (meaning they don't release an egg).  This is often used in conjunction with timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination (IUI).

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Some common side effects include:

* **Hot flashes:** This is one of the most frequently reported side effects.
* **Ovarian enlargement:**  The ovaries can become slightly enlarged, though usually this is temporary and resolves on its own.  In rare cases, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) can occur, which is a more serious complication.
* **Multiple pregnancies:** Clomiphene citrate increases the chance of twins, triplets, or higher-order multiples.
* **Mood changes:** Irritability, depression, or anxiety have been reported.
* **Headaches:**
* **Visual disturbances:** Blurred vision, light sensitivity, or other visual changes.  These usually resolve after stopping the medication.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**
* **Breast tenderness:**
* **Weight changes:**


**How it Works:** Clomiphene citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).  It works by blocking estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.  This action tricks the body into thinking estrogen levels are low.  In response, the pituitary gland releases more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are crucial for follicle development and ovulation in women.  In men, it can similarly stimulate the pituitary gland to increase gonadotropin production.
