# Clofibrate
### Generic Name
Clofibrate

### Usage
Clofibrate is primarily used to treat high levels of triglycerides (a type of fat) in the blood, a condition known as hypertriglyceridemia.  It's also used in the management of dyslipidemia, which is a broader term encompassing abnormalities in blood lipid levels, including high triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, often referred to as "good cholesterol").  Clofibrate helps to improve the lipid profile, reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications associated with these lipid disorders.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the individual's condition and response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow the healthcare provider's specific instructions.

**Adults:** The typical starting dose for hyperlipidemia is 2 grams per day, divided into multiple doses (e.g., 500 mg four times daily). Some individuals might respond effectively to lower doses.  The usual range is 1 to 2 grams daily, divided into 2 to 4 doses.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of clofibrate in children have not been established. It is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with kidney problems.  Those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) below 10 mL/min should not use clofibrate.  For CrCl between 10-50 mL/min, the recommended dose is 500 mg every 12-18 hours.  For CrCl above 50 mL/min, the dose is 500 mg every 6-12 hours.

**Hepatic Impairment:** Clofibrate is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with significant liver dysfunction.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include decreased appetite and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, constipation).

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients may include:  dizziness, headache, bloating, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, constipation, indigestion, blocked bile flow, itching, skin rashes, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight), hair loss, muscle weakness or pain,  acute kidney failure, erectile dysfunction, and increased blood creatinine levels.

Serious, though less common, side effects may include myopathy (muscle disease) and rhabdomyolysis (a severe muscle breakdown).  If you experience any unusual muscle pain, weakness, or dark urine, contact your healthcare provider immediately.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported promptly.

### How it Works
Clofibrate primarily works by increasing the activity of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in the blood. This action leads to lower levels of triglycerides and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). It also affects the production and clearance of other lipoproteins, ultimately improving the overall lipid profile.  It acts as an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARÎ±), a key regulator of lipid metabolism in the liver.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Clofibrate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to clofibrate or other fibrates, primary biliary cirrhosis, pre-existing gallbladder disease, and those concurrently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  It's also contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

* **Drug Interactions:** Clofibrate interacts with several medications.  It can increase the effects of anticoagulants (blood thinners) like warfarin, enhance the hypoglycemic effects of diabetes medications, and increase the risk of muscle toxicity when combined with statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). It can also interact with colchicine, sirolimus, ezetimibe, oral contraceptives, and rifampicin.  Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Clofibrate carries an increased risk of myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, cholelithiasis (gallstones), elevated liver enzymes, and mild decreases in blood cell counts (especially in the first year of use). Patients with pre-existing liver or kidney disease should use clofibrate with extreme caution, if at all.  Regular monitoring of blood lipid levels, liver function, kidney function, and blood counts is recommended.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take clofibrate with other medications?** A:  No, it's crucial to discuss all your medications with your doctor before starting clofibrate because of potential interactions.

* **Q: How should I store clofibrate?** A: Store clofibrate as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking clofibrate suddenly?** A: No, always follow your doctor's instructions regarding stopping the medication.  Sudden cessation may not be advisable.

* **Q:  Are there any dietary recommendations while taking clofibrate?** A: Maintaining a healthy diet and regular exercise is important for optimal lipid management.  Your doctor or dietician can provide guidance.
