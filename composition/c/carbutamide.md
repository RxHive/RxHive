# Carbutamide
### Generic Name
Carbutamide

### Usage
Carbutamide was a first-generation sulfonylurea primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Its primary function was to lower blood glucose levels.  However, it's crucial to note that Carbutamide is no longer available on the market due to significant safety concerns.  This information is provided for historical and educational purposes only.  Do not attempt to obtain or use Carbutamide.

### Dosage
Since Carbutamide is no longer available, specific dosage information is not applicable for current medical practice.  Past prescribing guidelines varied depending on the individual patient's needs and response, but exact details are unreliable and shouldn't be consulted for treatment.

### Side Effects
Because Carbutamide is obsolete,  a full and reliable list of side effects is difficult to compile with certainty.  However, it's known that a significant concern leading to its removal from the market was its potential for severe bone marrow toxicity, including agranulocytosis (a dangerous decrease in white blood cells). Other potential side effects reported historically included gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, and various other hematological issues.

### How it Works
Carbutamide worked by stimulating the release of insulin from the beta cells in the pancreas.  This increased insulin secretion helped lower blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Its mechanism of action was similar to other sulfonylureas, though it's now understood that the risk of serious adverse effects outweighed the benefits.

### Precautions
Given its severe side effects and removal from the market, any precautions related to Carbutamide are obsolete and irrelevant for current medical practice.  It is extremely important to reiterate that this medication should not be used under any circumstances.
