# Cefepime + Tazobactum

There is no generic drug combination of Cefepime and Tazobactam.  Cefepime is a cephalosporin antibiotic, and Tazobactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor often combined with other beta-lactam antibiotics (like piperacillin).  They are not typically used together.  Cefepime is often used alone, while Tazobactam is paired with piperacillin (Piperacillin/Tazobactam).  Therefore, a response providing details on a "generic Cefepime + Tazobactam" is not possible.

If you'd like information on either Cefepime or Piperacillin/Tazobactam separately, please specify which medication you are interested in.
