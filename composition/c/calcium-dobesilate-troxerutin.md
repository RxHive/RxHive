# Calcium Dobesilate + Troxerutin

**Generic Name:** Calcium Dobesilate + Troxerutin

**Usage:** This combination medication is primarily used to treat symptoms associated with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a condition where the veins have trouble returning blood to the heart.  This leads to symptoms like:

* Leg pain, heaviness, and aching.
* Swelling in the legs and ankles.
* Leg cramps.
* Varicose veins and spider veins.
* Restless legs syndrome (although less commonly the primary treatment)

It may also be used to treat other circulatory problems, but this should be under a doctor's direct supervision.  It's important to note that this combination doesn't cure CVI, but rather manages its symptoms.

**Side Effects:**  While generally well-tolerated, side effects are possible and can include:

* Gastrointestinal upset:  This is the most common side effect and may manifest as nausea, diarrhea, or stomach pain.
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Skin rash or itching
* Allergic reactions (rare, but potentially serious)


**How it Works:**

* **Calcium Dobesilate:** This is a flavonoid derivative that primarily strengthens capillary walls and improves their permeability. It helps reduce vascular fragility and leakage, decreasing edema (swelling) and relieving symptoms associated with poor venous circulation.

* **Troxerutin:**  Another bioflavonoid, Troxerutin, also works to improve microcirculation and reduce capillary fragility and permeability. It possesses antioxidant properties and helps protect against free radical damage to blood vessels.

The combination of Calcium Dobesilate and Troxerutin provides a synergistic effect, meaning their combined action is greater than the sum of their individual effects in managing CVI symptoms.
