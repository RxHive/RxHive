# Calcium Dobesilate + Troxerutin
### Generic Name
Calcium Dobesilate + Troxerutin

### Usage

Calcium dobesilate and troxerutin combination is primarily used to treat symptoms related to venous insufficiency, a condition where the veins have difficulty returning blood to the heart.  This often manifests as chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), characterized by symptoms like leg pain, swelling, heaviness, and aching, particularly after prolonged standing or sitting.  The combination's action targets multiple aspects of CVI: Calcium dobesilate helps strengthen capillary walls and reduce their permeability, while troxerutin possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, reducing swelling and protecting against further damage to the veins.  While not a cure for CVI, this combination aims to alleviate symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life. It's important to note that this combination is symptomatic treatment and does not address underlying causes of venous insufficiency.  Some formulations might also be used to treat symptoms of hemorrhoids, but this should always be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation, manufacturer, and the patient's condition.  Always follow the directions on your prescription label.  Generally, for adults, oral administration involves taking tablets or capsules as directed by a physician. The typical dosage ranges from one to two tablets multiple times a day, though precise recommendations depend on the severity of the symptoms.  There is generally no IV administration for this combination.  Pediatric usage isn't typically established; it's vital to consult a pediatrician before administering any medication to children.  Never adjust the dosage yourself; always adhere to the prescribed regimen.

### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, heartburn, diarrhea, constipation), headache, dizziness.  These are usually mild and transient.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), changes in blood pressure or heart rate.  Seek immediate medical attention if any severe allergic reaction or significant changes in your heart or blood pressure are observed.

It's crucial to report any unusual or persistent side effects to your doctor.

### How it Works

Calcium dobesilate works by reducing capillary permeability and fragility, meaning it strengthens the walls of the tiny blood vessels and prevents them from leaking. This helps reduce swelling and alleviate the pain associated with venous insufficiency. Troxerutin, a bioflavonoid, possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.  It helps protect blood vessel walls from damage caused by free radicals and reduces inflammation, thereby contributing to the reduction of symptoms.  Together, these two components offer a multi-pronged approach to managing the discomfort and symptoms of venous insufficiency.
