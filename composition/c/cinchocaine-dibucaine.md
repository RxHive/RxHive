# Cinchocaine [Dibucaine]
### Generic Name
Cinchocaine (also known as Dibucaine)

### Usage
Cinchocaine is a local anesthetic primarily used for the temporary relief of pain and itching associated with various skin conditions.  Its main applications include soothing sunburn, minor burns, minor cuts and scrapes, insect bites, and general minor skin irritations.  It's also indicated for the temporary relief of pain and itching related to hemorrhoids and other anorectal disorders.  The medication works by numbing the affected area, providing temporary symptomatic relief.

### Dosage
Cinchocaine is typically applied topically as a 1% ointment.

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Dermal pain/itching:** Apply a small amount of ointment to the affected area up to three or four times daily. The maximum daily dose is 30 grams.
* **Hemorrhoids/anorectal disorders:** Apply a small amount of ointment to the affected external anal area up to three or four times daily.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Dermal pain/itching:** For children aged 2 years and older weighing at least 16 kg (approximately 35 lbs) and adolescents, apply a small amount of ointment to the affected area up to three or four times daily. The maximum daily dose for children is 7.5 grams.  
* **Hemorrhoids/anorectal disorders:**  For children 12 years and older and adolescents, apply a small amount of ointment to the affected external anal area up to three or four times daily.

**Important Note:**  Always follow the instructions on the product label carefully.  If unsure about the appropriate dosage, consult a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site.  These can include:

* Localized burning sensation
* Contact dermatitis

Less common, but potentially more serious side effects, though rare, include:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Flushing
* Eye or skin irritation
* Diarrhea
* Chest pain
* Palpitations

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, discontinue use and seek medical advice immediately.

### How it Works
Cinchocaine is a local anesthetic that works by blocking nerve impulses in the affected area. It achieves this by reducing the permeability of nerve cell membranes to sodium ions. This prevents the transmission of pain and itch signals to the brain, resulting in temporary numbness and relief from discomfort.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Cinchocaine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to cinchocaine or any of its components. It should not be used in or near the eyes, and is not recommended for children under 2 years of age or weighing less than 16 kg (without specific medical supervision).
* **Drug Interactions:**  The effects of cinchocaine may be intensified by agents associated with methemoglobinemia.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Cinchocaine is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its effects on pregnancy are unknown.  It is recommended to consult a doctor before using cinchocaine during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Specific Populations:** Use in children under the specified age and weight should be under strict medical supervision. Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.
* **General Precautions:** For topical use only; avoid contact with eyes. Do not use large quantities, especially on raw surfaces or blistered areas. For rectal use, clean the area before application.  Discontinue use and consult a doctor if symptoms worsen, do not improve within 7 days, or if new symptoms such as redness, irritation, swelling, or bleeding develop.
