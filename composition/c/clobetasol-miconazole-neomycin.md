# Clobetasol + Miconazole + Neomycin

**Generic Name:** Clobetasol propionate + Miconazole nitrate + Neomycin sulfate

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid, antifungal, and antibiotic used to treat skin infections that involve three components:  inflammation (treated by the corticosteroid), fungal infection (treated by the antifungal), and bacterial infection (treated by the antibiotic).  It's commonly prescribed for conditions like:

* **Seborrheic dermatitis with secondary infection:** This is a common skin condition causing scaly, itchy patches, often complicated by yeast or bacterial infections.
* **Eczema (atopic dermatitis) with secondary infection:** Eczema can be exacerbated by bacterial or fungal infections.
* **Psoriasis with secondary infection:** Similar to eczema, psoriasis can become complicated by secondary infections.
* **Ringworm with inflammation and secondary bacterial infection:** Ringworm is a fungal infection that can become inflamed and infected with bacteria.


**Side Effects:**  Because this is a combination of powerful medications, side effects can be more pronounced than using each drug individually.  Possible side effects include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, redness.
* **Thinning of the skin (skin atrophy):** Prolonged use can lead to thinning and fragility of the skin.
* **Stretch marks (striae):** Particularly with prolonged use in areas of skin folds.
* **Acne:** Worsening of existing acne or development of new acne.
* **Hives:** Allergic reactions.
* **Increased risk of infection:** Suppression of the immune response by the corticosteroid can make you more susceptible to other infections.
* **Skin discoloration (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation):** Changes in skin color.
* **Telangiectasia:** Dilated blood vessels visible on the skin.
* **Perioral dermatitis:** Rash around the mouth.
* **Systemic absorption (rare but serious):**  While topical application minimizes systemic absorption, prolonged use or application to large areas can lead to systemic side effects mirroring those of oral corticosteroids (e.g., Cushing's syndrome, although this is rare with this topical combination).


**How it Works:**

* **Clobetasol propionate (corticosteroid):** Reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response in the skin.
* **Miconazole nitrate (antifungal):** Kills fungi by interfering with the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.
* **Neomycin sulfate (antibiotic):** Kills bacteria by inhibiting protein synthesis.


**FAQs:**

* **How long can I use this cream?**  Use only as directed by your doctor.  Typically, treatment is for a limited time, and prolonged use should be avoided to minimize side effects.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate duration of treatment.
* **Can I use this on my face?**  Only if specifically directed by your doctor.  The face is more sensitive, and the risk of side effects is higher.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Stop using the cream and contact your doctor immediately.
* **Can I use this cream on children?**  Use only as directed by your doctor.  Use in children is generally discouraged unless the benefits outweigh the risks.
* **Can I use this cream during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** Consult your doctor. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is generally avoided unless absolutely necessary and the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks to the baby.
* **Can I use other topical medications with this cream?**  Discuss with your doctor before using any other topical treatments to avoid interactions and potential side effects.
* **What if I miss a dose?**  Apply the cream as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't apply a double dose to make up for a missed one.
