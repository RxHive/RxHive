# Centchroman
### Generic Name
Centchroman

### Usage
Centchroman is primarily used as a once-a-month oral contraceptive for women.  It's a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), meaning it acts differently on estrogen receptors in various parts of the body. This unique mechanism allows it to prevent pregnancy without the typical side effects associated with some combined oral contraceptives (like those containing estrogen and progestin).  While its primary use is contraception, some research suggests potential additional uses in managing uterine fibroids and endometriosis, though more research is needed to solidify these applications as standard treatments.  It's crucial to understand that Centchroman is not approved for these secondary uses in all regions. Always consult a healthcare provider before using Centchroman for any purpose.


### Dosage
Dosage for Centchroman varies depending on the intended use (currently primarily contraception) and individual patient factors.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage and regimen.  Generally, for contraceptive purposes, it is typically administered as a 30mg tablet once a month, taken on the same day each month.  The exact timing within the menstrual cycle will be determined by the physician.  There are no established pediatric or intravenous dosages for Centchroman at this time.  This medication comes only in oral tablet form.  It is crucial to follow the prescribed dosage precisely and not alter it without consulting a doctor.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of Centchroman can include:

* Irregular menstrual bleeding
* Weight changes (gain or loss)
* Headaches
* Nausea
* Breast tenderness
* Mood changes

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Thromboembolic events (blood clots) – though this risk is considered relatively low compared to some combined oral contraceptives.
* Liver dysfunction – rare but serious.
* Allergic reactions.

It's vital to report any unusual or concerning side effects to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Centchroman works by modulating the effects of estrogen in the body.  Specifically, it acts as an antagonist (blocker) in some tissues and an agonist (activator) in others. This selective action interferes with the hormonal processes necessary for ovulation and implantation, thereby preventing pregnancy.  The precise mechanisms related to its potential effects on uterine fibroids and endometriosis are still under investigation but are believed to involve similar interactions with estrogen receptors in these tissues.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Centchroman should not be used by individuals with liver disease, active thromboembolic disorders, unexplained vaginal bleeding, or known hypersensitivity to the drug.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Potential interactions with other medications exist. It's essential to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking before starting Centchroman.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Centchroman is a contraceptive and should not be used during pregnancy.  Its use during breastfeeding is not recommended and needs careful consideration and monitoring by a physician.
* **Elderly:** The use of Centchroman in elderly women is not typically indicated as the primary indication is contraception.
* **Children:** Centchroman is not approved for use in children.
