# Cariprazine
### Generic Name
Cariprazine

### Usage
Cariprazine is an atypical antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat schizophrenia in adults.  It's also approved for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults, and for treating depressive episodes (bipolar depression) in adults with bipolar I disorder.  The medication works by affecting the balance of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, which are implicated in these conditions.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Because Cariprazine and its active metabolites have a long half-life, changes in dosage won't be fully reflected in blood levels for several weeks.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Schizophrenia:** The starting dose is typically 1.5 mg once daily (OD). This may be increased to 3 mg OD on day 2, and further adjusted in increments of 1.5 mg or 3 mg based on response and tolerance. The recommended range is 1.5-6 mg OD, with a maximum daily dose of 6 mg.

* **Manic or Mixed Episodes (Bipolar I Disorder):**  The initial dose is 1.5 mg OD, increased to 3 mg OD on day 2. Further adjustments may be made in increments of 1.5 mg or 3 mg, as needed. The recommended range is 3-6 mg OD, with a maximum daily dose of 6 mg.

* **Depressive Episodes (Bipolar Depression):** The starting dose is 1.5 mg OD.  This may be increased to 3 mg OD on day 15, depending on response and tolerance. The maximum daily dose is 3 mg.


**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of Cariprazine in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with hepatic or renal impairment.  Those with mild to moderate impairment may not require adjustments, but severe impairment generally necessitates avoiding Cariprazine.  Specific adjustments are also needed when starting or stopping strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (drugs that affect how the liver processes Cariprazine), as these interactions significantly alter the drug's blood levels. Consult your doctor for precise instructions based on your specific situation and any other medications you're taking.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Nervous system:  Extrapyramidal symptoms (movement disorders), Parkinson's-like symptoms, akathisia (restlessness), headache, insomnia.
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea


**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients or reported in post-marketing surveillance):**

* Nervous system: Drowsiness, restlessness, dizziness, anxiety, agitation, dystonia (muscle spasms), fatigue, suicidal ideation.
* Cardiovascular: Hypertension (high blood pressure), tachycardia (rapid heart rate).
* Ophthalmic: Blurred vision.
* Gastrointestinal: Vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia (indigestion), abdominal pain, diarrhea, decreased appetite, dry mouth.
* Dermatologic: Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis).
* Endocrine and Metabolic: Weight gain, hyponatremia (low sodium levels in blood).
* Hepatic: Increased liver enzymes.
* Neuromuscular and Skeletal: Increased creatine phosphokinase levels (muscle enzyme), limb pain, back pain, muscle rigidity, joint pain (arthralgia).
* Genitourinary: Frequent urination (pollakiuria).

**Rare, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (reported in post-marketing surveillance or as case reports):**

* Stroke, transient ischemic attack, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hepatitis, low white blood cell count (leukopenia/neutropenia), muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (severe skin reaction).


**If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

Cariprazine is an atypical antipsychotic that works by modulating the activity of dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain.  Specifically, it acts as a partial agonist at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, and as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.  This complex interaction helps to restore the balance of neurotransmission disrupted in conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, leading to improvements in symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cariprazine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to the drug or any of its ingredients.

* **Interactions:**  Cariprazine's effects can be significantly altered by other medications, particularly strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers.  Concurrent use with central nervous system (CNS) depressants should also be approached cautiously.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Warnings:** Cariprazine carries a boxed warning regarding increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis (it is not approved for this use).  There's also a warning about the potential for increased suicidal thoughts and behaviors, particularly in young adults.  Close monitoring is essential, especially during initial treatment and after dose adjustments.  Other precautions relate to risks of extrapyramidal symptoms, orthostatic hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing), weight gain, metabolic changes (diabetes, dyslipidemia), falls, and seizures.  Patients with hepatic or renal impairment, those at risk for aspiration pneumonia, and those with certain cardiovascular conditions require careful monitoring and potentially dosage adjustments.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Cariprazine with alcohol?** A: No, alcohol should be avoided as it can increase the risk of central nervous system depression and worsen side effects.

* **Q: How should I store Cariprazine?** A:  Store Cariprazine as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Cariprazine suddenly?** A: No, you should never stop taking Cariprazine abruptly.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering the dose to minimize withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose.

* **Q: Is Cariprazine habit-forming?** A:  While Cariprazine is not considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids, stopping the medication abruptly after long-term use can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping the medication.

* **Q:  Is Cariprazine safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  Cariprazine may cause harm to a developing fetus.  The decision to use Cariprazine during pregnancy should be made only after carefully weighing the potential risks and benefits with a healthcare provider.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; the risks and benefits of breastfeeding while taking Cariprazine should be discussed with your doctor.
