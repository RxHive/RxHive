# Cariprazine

**Generic Name:** Cariprazine

**Usage:**

Cariprazine is an atypical antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat:

* **Schizophrenia:**  It helps to reduce positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) and negative symptoms (flat affect, social withdrawal) of schizophrenia in adults.
* **Bipolar I disorder:** It's used as an add-on treatment to mood stabilizers to treat manic or mixed episodes in adults.  It's not typically used as monotherapy for bipolar disorder.
* **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):**  In some cases, cariprazine is used as an augmentation strategy to improve the effectiveness of antidepressant medication in adults with MDD who haven't responded adequately to other treatments.


**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, cariprazine can cause side effects. Some common side effects include:

* **Movement disorders:**  Akathisia (restlessness, inability to sit still), Parkinsonism (rigidity, tremor, slow movement), and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements of the face, mouth, and tongue â€“ this is a potentially serious long-term side effect) are possible, though less frequent than with some other antipsychotics.
* **Weight changes:** Both weight gain and weight loss have been reported.
* **Sedation/Drowsiness:**  This is a common side effect, especially at the start of treatment.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** These gastrointestinal side effects are relatively common.
* **Insomnia or sleep disturbances:**  While sedation is possible, some individuals experience difficulty sleeping.
* **Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing):**  This can cause dizziness or lightheadedness.
* **Increased prolactin levels:** This can lead to menstrual irregularities in women and gynecomastia (breast enlargement) in men.
* **Qtc prolongation:** This is an increase in the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), which can increase the risk of serious heart rhythm problems.  This is usually monitored by a physician.


**How it Works:**

Cariprazine is a dopamine D3 and D2 receptor partial agonist and a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. This means it works by:

* **Partially activating dopamine D3 receptors:**  This is thought to be important for its antipsychotic and antidepressant effects.  Unlike typical antipsychotics which *block* dopamine receptors, cariprazine's partial agonism leads to a more balanced effect.
* **Partially activating dopamine D2 receptors:** This action contributes to its effectiveness in treating psychosis.
* **Blocking serotonin 5-HT2A receptors:** This action contributes to its antipsychotic and antidepressant effects and may also help reduce some side effects associated with typical antipsychotics.

This complex mechanism of action is thought to contribute to its relatively lower risk of some movement disorders compared to other antipsychotics.


**FAQs:**

* **Is cariprazine addictive?**  Cariprazine is not considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids or benzodiazepines. However, stopping the medication suddenly after long-term use can lead to withdrawal symptoms. It's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking cariprazine?**  Alcohol should generally be avoided or limited while taking cariprazine, as it can increase the risk of sedation and other side effects.  Discuss alcohol consumption with your prescribing physician.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.

* **Can I take cariprazine with other medications?**  There are potential drug interactions with other medications, especially other medications affecting the heart or central nervous system.  It is crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **How long does it take to work?**  It may take several weeks to experience the full benefits of cariprazine.  It's important to continue taking it as prescribed, even if you don't notice immediate improvement.
