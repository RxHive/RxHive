# Carfilzomib
### Generic Name
Carfilzomib

### Usage
Carfilzomib is a proteasome inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of multiple myeloma.  It's specifically indicated for patients who have already received at least two prior therapies, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent.  The drug is often used in combination with other medications like lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone alone, for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after one or more prior therapies.  While not officially approved for this purpose, it's also sometimes used off-label in treating Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.

### Dosage
Carfilzomib dosage is complex and highly individualized, varying based on the specific treatment regimen (combination therapy or monotherapy), the patient's body surface area (BSA), and their response to the treatment. It's always administered intravenously (IV).

**Multiple Myeloma:**  Dosage and administration schedules differ significantly depending on whether it's used in combination with other drugs or as monotherapy. For example, in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, the initial dose might be 20 mg/m² on days 1 and 2 of a 4-week cycle, escalating to 27 mg/m² in subsequent cycles. The frequency and total number of cycles are also determined by the treatment plan and the patient's response.  Monotherapy regimens follow similar patterns, but with different starting and escalating doses. Detailed schedules are provided by the prescribing physician and are crucial to follow precisely.


**Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (Off-label):**  In this context,  carfilzomib is used as part of a combination regimen that typically includes dexamethasone and rituximab. The dosage varies depending on the specific treatment phase (induction vs. maintenance).  Dosage is generally higher for maintenance therapy. Premedication is often employed.  Again, the specific dosage and administration schedule must be obtained from the prescribing physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dose adjustments are often necessary based on factors like liver or kidney function.  Pre-existing or treatment-induced impairment may require a dose reduction or temporary interruption of treatment.  The specifics are determined on a case-by-case basis, guided by the patient's health and the treating physician's judgment.  There are no established dosages for children.

### Side Effects
Carfilzomib can cause a range of side effects, some common and others more serious but less frequent.  It's crucial to report any concerning symptoms to your doctor immediately.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Fatigue
* Anemia
* Nausea
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Diarrhea
* Pyrexia (fever)
* Headache
* Increased blood creatinine levels
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Muscle spasms
* Hypertension
* Hypokalemia (low potassium)
* Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Increased serum AST levels (liver enzyme)
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium)
* Hypophosphatemia (low blood phosphorus)
* Hyponatremia (low blood sodium)


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

* Pneumonia
* Acute renal failure
* Congestive heart failure
* Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
* Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
* Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
* Cardiac arrest
* Myocardial ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart)
* Pulmonary hypertension
* Pulmonary complications
* Infusion reactions
* Tumor lysis syndrome
* Hepatic toxicity


### How it Works
Carfilzomib is a proteasome inhibitor. Proteasomes are cellular enzymes responsible for breaking down proteins.  By irreversibly binding to and inhibiting the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome, carfilzomib causes a buildup of abnormal proteins within cancer cells. This accumulation triggers cellular stress, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis (programmed cell death), and ultimately, tumor growth inhibition.

### Precautions
Several precautions are essential when using carfilzomib:

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Carfilzomib is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* **Bone Marrow Suppression:** Carfilzomib can significantly suppress bone marrow function, increasing the risk of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and other blood disorders.
* **Cardiovascular Effects:**  The drug carries a risk of cardiac complications including heart failure, myocardial ischemia, and even cardiac arrest.  Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease should be carefully monitored.
* **Other Risks:**  Carfilzomib is associated with risks of hemorrhage, hepatic toxicity, renal toxicity, infusion reactions, and thrombotic microangiopathy.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While interactions with other medications are generally not significant due to its metabolism pathways, concurrent use with certain drugs, such as oral contraceptives or those increasing thrombosis risk, should be avoided. The physician needs to be informed about all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Carfilzomib use during pregnancy is not recommended due to the potential for fetal harm.  Breastfeeding is contraindicated during and for at least two days after treatment.
* **Hydration:**  Adequate hydration is crucial to reduce the risk of renal toxicity and tumor lysis syndrome.


### FAQs
* **Q: How is carfilzomib stored?** A:  Storage instructions will be provided with the medication. Generally, it needs to be refrigerated.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Never adjust your dosage or frequency without consulting your physician.
* **Q:  What are the signs of an infusion reaction?** A:  Symptoms can include fever, chills, joint pain, muscle pain, flushing, facial edema, vomiting, weakness, shortness of breath, hypotension, fainting, chest tightness, or angina.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* **Q:  How long will I need to take carfilzomib?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your response and tolerance to the medication and will be determined by your oncologist.
* **Q: Is carfilzomib safe for everyone?**  A: No.  Carfilzomib has several contraindications and precautions, making it unsuitable for certain individuals.  Your doctor will assess your health to determine if it's a safe and appropriate treatment option.
