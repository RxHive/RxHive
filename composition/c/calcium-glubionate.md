# Calcium Glubionate
### Generic Name
Calcium Glubionate

### Usage
Calcium glubionate is primarily used to prevent and treat calcium deficiency.  This deficiency can stem from various causes, including inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption issues (like in celiac disease or Crohn's disease), or certain medical conditions affecting calcium metabolism.  It's also used in treating conditions where the body requires increased calcium, such as rickets (in children) and hypocalcemia (low blood calcium) in various age groups. While not its primary use, it may be utilized as a supplemental calcium source for pregnant and breastfeeding women to support increased calcium needs during these periods.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional and tailored to the individual's specific needs and condition. The information below is for general understanding and should not be used for self-medication.  Each 5 mL of calcium glubionate typically contains 115 mg of elemental calcium.


**Adults:**  The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for calcium varies based on age and gender.  A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dosage of calcium glubionate needed to meet individual requirements.  For example, pregnant and breastfeeding women might require 15 mL three or four times daily.

**Children:** Dosage for children also depends heavily on age and weight.  Infants might receive 5 mL five times a day, while older children may receive 10-15 mL three times daily.  For treating specific conditions like rickets or hypocalcemia, the dosage is often calculated based on weight (mg/kg/day) and administered in divided doses.


**Administration:** Calcium glubionate is typically given orally.  It can be administered directly or mixed with juice or formula (for infants).  Specific instructions will be provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Abdominal pain
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Increased thirst
* Polyuria (increased urination)
* Xerostomia (dry mouth)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) and hypercalciuria (high calcium levels in urine).  If you experience any of these or other concerning side effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Calcium glubionate is a source of elemental calcium.  Calcium is an essential mineral with diverse functions in the body. It plays a crucial role in building and maintaining strong bones and teeth, nerve transmission, muscle contraction, and blood clotting. By supplementing calcium levels, calcium glubionate helps address deficiencies and supports these vital bodily functions.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Calcium glubionate is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication or its components, those with renal calculi (kidney stones), and individuals with certain metabolic disorders such as galactosemia or lactase deficiency.
* **Drug Interactions:** Calcium glubionate can interact with numerous medications, including some antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones), bisphosphonates, and certain heart medications. It's essential to inform your healthcare provider about all medications and supplements you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding,  the dosage should be carefully managed by a healthcare professional to meet increased requirements without causing adverse effects.
* **Renal Impairment:** Individuals with kidney problems should use calcium glubionate with caution as the body may have difficulty eliminating excess calcium. Careful monitoring of blood calcium levels is crucial.
* **Other Considerations:**  High doses of calcium can lead to kidney stones.  Avoid taking calcium glubionate with foods high in oxalates (e.g., spinach) as they can interfere with calcium absorption. Consider taking it with Vitamin D for improved absorption.
