# Ceftriaxone + Tazobactum

**Generic Name:** Ceftriaxone/Sulbactam (Note:  It's not Tazobactam.  The combination is Ceftriaxone and Sulbactam. Tazobactam is paired with Piperacillin.)


**Usage:**  Ceftriaxone/Sulbactam is a combination antibiotic used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections, particularly those resistant to other antibiotics.  Specific uses include:

* **Intra-abdominal infections:** Infections within the abdomen, such as peritonitis (inflammation of the lining of the abdomen)
* **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID):** Infection of the female reproductive organs.
* **Skin and skin structure infections:**  Such as cellulitis, abscesses.
* **Respiratory tract infections:** Pneumonia, bronchitis (in some cases).
* **Septicemia:** Bloodstream infection.
* **Gynecological infections:**  Endometritis, salpingitis.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Ceftriaxone/Sulbactam can cause side effects. Some are common, while others are rare but serious.  These can include:

* **Common:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, injection site pain or inflammation (if given intramuscularly or intravenously).
* **Less Common:**  Rash, itching, dizziness, yeast infection (thrush), elevated liver enzymes.
* **Serious (rare but require immediate medical attention):** Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (C. diff), seizures, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis).


**How it Works:**

Ceftriaxone is a cephalosporin antibiotic.  It works by interfering with the production of bacterial cell walls, leading to bacterial death. Sulbactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by some bacteria that break down beta-lactam antibiotics (like ceftriaxone), rendering them ineffective. Sulbactam inhibits these enzymes, allowing ceftriaxone to work effectively against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant.  The combination provides broader coverage against a wider range of bacteria.
