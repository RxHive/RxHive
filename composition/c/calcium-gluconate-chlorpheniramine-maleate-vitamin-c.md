# Calcium Gluconate + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Vitamin C

**Generic Name:** Calcium Gluconate + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Vitamin C

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat symptoms associated with common cold, flu, or allergies.  Specifically:

* **Calcium Gluconate:**  Contributes to overall health and may help alleviate some symptoms associated with allergic reactions (though it's not the primary mechanism).  It's included mainly for its purported role in helping to support the body during illness.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that helps relieve runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes and throat, and other symptoms caused by allergies or the common cold.  It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.
* **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid):**  An antioxidant that supports the immune system. While it may not directly treat cold or allergy symptoms, it's believed to aid in recovery and potentially reduce the duration or severity of illness.

**Important Note:** This combination is not a cure for the underlying illness (cold, flu, allergies) but rather addresses the symptoms.  Consult a doctor if symptoms worsen or persist.  This information is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects may include:

* **Drowsiness:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate is a sedating antihistamine.
* **Dry mouth:** A common side effect of antihistamines.
* **Constipation:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Headache:**
* **Difficulty urinating:**  Potentially more likely in individuals with pre-existing urinary issues.

Rare but serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention.  Consult the product information leaflet for a complete list.

**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  Blocks histamine receptors, preventing histamine from binding and causing allergy symptoms.
* **Vitamin C:** Acts as an antioxidant, potentially reducing inflammation and supporting immune function.  Its direct effect on cold and allergy symptoms is debated.
* **Calcium Gluconate:** Its role in this combination is primarily supportive, providing calcium which is essential for numerous bodily functions. It doesn't directly address cold or allergy symptoms.
