# Castor Oil
### Generic Name
Castor Oil

### Usage
Castor oil is primarily used as a stimulant laxative for the temporary relief of occasional constipation.  It works by stimulating the intestines to increase bowel movements. While primarily used for constipation, it's important to note that  its use has largely been superseded by gentler laxatives with fewer side effects.  It's not typically the first choice for managing chronic constipation.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** For bowel evacuation or constipation relief, the oral dosage is 15-60 mL as a single dose.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Use of castor oil in children is generally discouraged in favor of safer alternatives like polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions or lactulose.  However, if used, the dosage is as follows:

* **Children aged 2-11 years:** 5-15 mL orally as a single daily dose as needed.
* **Children aged 12 years and older/adolescents:** 15-60 mL orally as a single daily dose as needed.

**Important Note:** Castor oil typically produces a bowel movement within 6-12 hours.  

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by manufacturers for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance if you have these conditions.


### Side Effects

* Abdominal cramps
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Dizziness
* Pelvic congestion syndrome
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Electrolyte disturbances (less common, but serious)

**Serious Side Effects:** While less common, electrolyte imbalances can be serious.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, signs of dehydration (excessive thirst, dizziness), or any other concerning symptoms.


### How it Works

Castor oil is broken down in the small intestine into ricinoleic acid.  This acid reduces the absorption of fluid and electrolytes in the intestines. It also stimulates the muscles in the intestinal walls (peristalsis), leading to increased bowel movements.  The increased intestinal motility and reduced fluid absorption combine to produce a laxative effect.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Castor oil should not be used by individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to castor oil, gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation, severe fecal impaction, symptoms suggestive of appendicitis or other acute abdominal conditions, ulcerative colitis, or rectal fissures.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Combining castor oil with other stimulant laxatives, such as sodium sulfate, may increase the risk of adverse effects like mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis. Avoid such combinations.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ingesting castor oil may induce labor and is generally avoided during pregnancy. It's considered safe for use during lactation (breastfeeding).
* **General Precautions:** Do not take castor oil at bedtime due to its rapid onset of action. Administer it on an empty stomach with juice or carbonated beverage. Do not use it for more than one week or if you experience abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or rectal bleeding unless advised by a doctor. Castor oil is generally not recommended as a first-line treatment for constipation in the elderly. Urine may temporarily appear yellow or brown.
