# Chlorpheniramine + Dextromethorphan
### Generic Name
Chlorpheniramine + Dextromethorphan

### Usage

Chlorpheniramine and Dextromethorphan is a combination medication used to treat symptoms of the common cold and other upper respiratory allergies.  It provides relief from several symptoms simultaneously.  Primarily, it's used to address:

* **Runny nose:** Chlorpheniramine helps dry up nasal secretions.
* **Sneezing:**  Chlorpheniramine, as an antihistamine, reduces the allergic response contributing to sneezing.
* **Itchy/watery eyes:**  Again, the antihistamine properties of chlorpheniramine alleviate these symptoms.
* **Itchy nose/throat:** Similar to the eyes, chlorpheniramine targets the allergic reaction causing itchiness.
* **Cough:** Dextromethorphan acts as a cough suppressant, reducing the urge to cough by affecting the brain's cough center.

While primarily used for cold and allergy symptom relief, it's crucial to understand this medication only treats *symptoms* and doesn't address the underlying cause of the illness.

### How it Works

This combination medication works through two different mechanisms:

* **Chlorpheniramine:** This is an antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  By blocking histamine, chlorpheniramine helps reduce symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes, and itchy throat.

* **Dextromethorphan:** This is a cough suppressant (antitussive) that works in the brain to reduce the cough reflex. It doesn't treat the underlying cause of the cough but reduces the frequency and intensity of coughing fits.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used if you are allergic to chlorpheniramine, dextromethorphan, or any of its ingredients.  It should also not be used within 14 days of stopping a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).

* **Drug Interactions:** This medication can interact with other drugs, particularly other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (like alcohol or sedatives) and certain CYP2D6 inhibitors.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in children under 6 years old, pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, older adults, individuals with glaucoma, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or chronic respiratory conditions (like asthma or COPD).

* **Driving and Machinery:** Drowsiness is a common side effect, so avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medication affects you.

* **Productive Cough:** This medication is not suitable for a productive cough (one that produces phlegm).  If you have a cough that produces mucus, consult your doctor.
