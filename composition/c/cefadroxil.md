# Cefadroxil

**Generic Name:** Cefadroxil

**Usage:** Cefadroxil is an oral antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Middle ear infections (otitis media):**  Especially in children.
* **Skin infections:** Such as impetigo, cellulitis, and wound infections.
* **Throat infections (pharyngitis) and tonsillitis:** Caused by susceptible bacteria.
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):**  Though other antibiotics are often preferred for UTIs.


**Side Effects:**  Like all antibiotics, Cefadroxil can cause side effects.  These vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. These are often mild and resolve without treatment.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives.  In rare cases, more severe allergic reactions like angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) or anaphylaxis can occur.  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience a severe allergic reaction.**
* **Vaginal yeast infections:**  Cefadroxil can disrupt the balance of normal bacteria in the vagina, leading to yeast overgrowth.
* **Increased risk of bleeding:** Although rare, it can affect blood clotting.
* **Changes in liver function tests:**  These are usually temporary and resolve after stopping the medication.


**How it Works:** Cefadroxil is a cephalosporin antibiotic.  It works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to build their cell walls.  This weakens the bacteria, preventing them from multiplying and ultimately leading to their death.  It's important to note that it only works against bacteria; it's ineffective against viruses.


**FAQs:**

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Mild side effects often resolve on their own.  However, if you experience severe or persistent side effects, contact your doctor immediately.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Cefadroxil?**  It's generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking antibiotics, as it can interact with some medications and potentially worsen side effects.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist.
