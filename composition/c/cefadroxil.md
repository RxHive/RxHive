# Cefadroxil
### Generic Name
Cefadroxil

### Usage
Cefadroxil is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic primarily used to treat bacterial infections.  Its main applications include:

* **Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):** Cefadroxil effectively combats bacteria causing uncomplicated UTIs, such as cystitis.  It's often considered an alternative treatment option.  For complicated UTIs or pyelonephritis (kidney infection), it might be used, but usually following initial treatment with a parenteral (injectable) antibiotic.

* **Skin and Skin Structure Infections:**  This includes infections like impetigo and other bacterial skin infections.

* **Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis (Strep Throat):** Cefadroxil can be an alternative treatment for strep throat in individuals with mild or non-anaphylactic penicillin allergies.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies depending on the infection being treated.  Always follow your doctor's prescription.  Common regimens include:

* **Skin and Skin Structure Infections:** 1 gram (g) daily, either as a single dose or divided into two doses.
* **Strep Throat:** 1 g daily for 10 days.  Some sources suggest 500 mg twice daily.
* **Uncomplicated Cystitis (UTI):** 500 mg twice daily for 5-7 days.
* **Complicated UTIs (including pyelonephritis):** 1 g twice daily for 10-14 days (usually after initial intravenous treatment).

**Pediatric Dosage:** Dosage is calculated based on the child's weight (mg/kg).  Always follow your doctor's instructions.  Typical regimens:

* **Mild to Moderate Infections (General):** 15 mg/kg twice daily, with a maximum daily dose of 2000 mg.
* **Impetigo:** 30 mg/kg daily, in a single dose or divided, with a maximum daily dose of 1000 mg.
* **Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis:** 30 mg/kg daily for 10 days, in a single dose or divided, with a maximum daily dose of 1000 mg.
* **Skin and Skin Structure Infections:** 15 mg/kg every 12 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 1000 mg.
* **UTIs:** 15 mg/kg every 12 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 2000 mg.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal (kidney) impairment requires dosage adjustment.  Hepatic (liver) impairment does not typically require dosage changes, according to current manufacturer labeling.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific instructions.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Diarrhea

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Abdominal pain
* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema)
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Liver problems (cholestasis, increased liver enzymes, hepatic failure)
* Skin rashes (erythema multiforme, maculopapular rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
* Blood disorders (agranulocytosis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)
* *Clostridioides difficile* infection (a serious intestinal infection)
* Pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon)
* Nausea, vomiting


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly severe ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Cefadroxil is a beta-lactam antibiotic. It works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to build their cell walls.  Specifically, it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) within the bacterial cell wall, preventing the final steps of cell wall synthesis. This disruption leads to bacterial cell death.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Cefadroxil is contraindicated in individuals with a known allergy to cephalosporin antibiotics or any component of the medication.  Caution is advised in patients with a penicillin allergy, as cross-reactivity is possible.

* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with kidney problems.

* **Gastrointestinal Issues:**  Use caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Cefadroxil is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning animal studies have shown no risk, but human studies are lacking.  It is excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.

* **Drug Interactions:** Cefadroxil can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Specifically, it may interact with probenecid (increasing Cefadroxil levels), vitamin K antagonists (affecting blood clotting), and certain vaccines.


### FAQs

* **Can I take Cefadroxil with food?**  Yes, taking Cefadroxil with food may reduce stomach upset.

* **How should I store Cefadroxil?**  Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **How long does it take to work?** You may start feeling better within a few days, but it's crucial to complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Cefadroxil?** While there's no direct interaction, alcohol can exacerbate some side effects like nausea and stomach upset. It is best to avoid alcohol while on the medication.

* **What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** Contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention if you develop severe allergic reactions, severe diarrhea, or other concerning symptoms.
