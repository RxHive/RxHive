# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Levodropropizine
### Generic Name
Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Levodropropizine


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections.  Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that works to reduce symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes. Levodropropizine is an expectorant; it helps thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.  Therefore, this combination is effective in treating symptoms such as:

* **Runny nose:**  Both components contribute to reducing nasal discharge.
* **Sneezing:** The antihistamine component helps control sneezing fits.
* **Itchy, watery eyes:**  The antihistamine directly addresses these allergic-type symptoms.
* **Cough with mucus:** The expectorant helps clear congested airways.
* **Congestion:** While not directly addressing the underlying cause of congestion, it helps relieve the symptoms by thinning mucus and reducing inflammation associated with allergies.

It's crucial to understand that this medication treats *symptoms* and doesn't cure the underlying infection.  If symptoms persist or worsen, it's vital to consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works

Chlorpheniramine maleate blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking histamine, it reduces symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.  Levodropropizine works by increasing the fluid content of respiratory mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel through coughing.  This combination addresses both the allergic and the mucus-related aspects of upper respiratory symptoms.
