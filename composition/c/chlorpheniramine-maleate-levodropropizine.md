# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Levodropropizine

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Levodropropizine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, flu, or other respiratory illnesses.  Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that helps to dry up runny nose and watery eyes. Levodropropizine is an expectorant that helps loosen and thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.  Therefore, this combination is typically used to treat symptoms such as:

* Runny nose
* Sneezing
* Itchy, watery eyes
* Cough with mucus (productive cough)


**Side Effects:** Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Stomach upset
* Difficulty urinating

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Fast heartbeat
* Seizures
* Confusion


**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This antihistamine works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine is responsible for many of the symptoms of a cold or allergy, such as runny nose and itchy eyes. By blocking histamine, chlorpheniramine maleate helps to reduce these symptoms.

* **Levodropropizine:** This expectorant works by increasing the flow of fluid into the airways. This helps to thin the mucus, making it easier to cough up and clear from the lungs.  It doesn't suppress the cough reflex itself, but aids in the productive expulsion of mucus.
