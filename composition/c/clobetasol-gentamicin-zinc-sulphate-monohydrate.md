# Clobetasol + Gentamicin + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate

**Generic Name:** Clobetasol Propionate + Gentamicin Sulfate + Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid (clobetasol propionate), an aminoglycoside antibiotic (gentamicin sulfate), and an astringent (zinc sulfate monohydrate). It's used to treat inflammatory skin conditions that are complicated by bacterial infection.  Specific conditions may include:

* **Infected eczema (dermatitis):**  Where eczema is accompanied by a secondary bacterial infection.
* **Infected psoriasis:**  Similar to eczema, psoriasis can become infected, requiring this type of treatment.
* **Infected atopic dermatitis:**  A more severe form of eczema often associated with bacterial overgrowth.


**Important Note:** This is a potent medication. It should only be used as prescribed by a doctor and for the specific condition diagnosed.  Improper or prolonged use can lead to serious side effects.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the duration and extent of use. Common side effects include:

* **At the application site:** Burning, itching, irritation, dryness, redness, skin thinning, striae (stretch marks), folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles), perioral dermatitis (rash around the mouth), hypertrichosis (increased hair growth), hypopigmentation (loss of skin color).
* **Systemic (less common but more serious):**  Prolonged or extensive use can lead to suppression of the adrenal glands (particularly in children and with large areas of application), Cushing's syndrome symptoms (rare), cataracts, glaucoma (with long-term ocular use).
* **Allergic reactions:**  Contact dermatitis (allergic skin reaction), urticaria (hives), angioedema (swelling).
* **Gentamicin-specific:**  Hearing loss (rare but serious), kidney problems (rare).

This is not an exhaustive list, and severe side effects are more likely with prolonged or widespread use.  Consult a doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or worsening symptoms.


**How it Works:**

* **Clobetasol Propionate:** A potent corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune system's response in the skin.
* **Gentamicin Sulfate:** An aminoglycoside antibiotic that kills bacteria causing the secondary infection.
* **Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate:** An astringent that helps to dry the skin, reduce inflammation, and promote healing.  It also has some antimicrobial properties.

The combination of these three active ingredients provides a multi-pronged approach to treating inflammatory skin conditions complicated by bacterial infection.
