# Chromium Polynicotinate
### Generic Name
Chromium Polynicotinate

### Usage
Chromium polynicotinate is primarily used as a dietary supplement to address chromium deficiency.  While some studies suggest potential benefits in managing hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol),  the medical use of chromium in general, and polynicotinate specifically, isn't definitively established and shouldn't replace standard medical treatments for cholesterol or other conditions.  It's considered a complementary therapy and its effectiveness in these areas requires further robust clinical research.

### Dosage
Dosage recommendations for chromium polynicotinate vary significantly depending on the intended use and the individual's needs.  There isn't a universally agreed-upon therapeutic dosage for medical conditions.

**Adults:** The recommended adequate intake (AI) for chromium, according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM 2001), varies based on age and sex.  These levels are for dietary intake, not necessarily supplementation.  Examples include:

* Males 14-50 years: 35 mcg/day
* Males >50 years: 30 mcg/day
* Females 19-50 years: 25 mcg/day
* Females >50 years: 20 mcg/day
* Pregnancy: 30 mcg/day
* Lactation: 45 mcg/day

For specific conditions like hyperlipidemia, studies have used dosages ranging from 200 mcg to 600 mcg per day, often in combination with other supplements.  However, these studies are not conclusive.

**Children:**  The AI for chromium also varies with age, ranging from 0.2 mcg/day in infants to 35 mcg/day in adolescent boys.   Again,  there's no established therapeutic dosage for children outside of the general AI recommendations.


**Important Note:**  Always follow the instructions on the specific product label and consult a healthcare professional before taking any chromium supplement, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.  The information provided here is for general knowledge and should not be interpreted as a prescription or recommendation.

### Side Effects
While generally considered safe at recommended dietary intake levels, some side effects have been reported with higher doses of chromium polynicotinate or other chromium forms:

* **Common:**  Mild gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea, constipation)
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Kidney or liver damage (rare but has been associated with other chromium forms), allergic reactions.

If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and seek medical attention immediately.

### How it Works
Chromium is an essential trace mineral that plays a role in glucose metabolism, working alongside insulin to help regulate blood sugar levels. It may also influence lipid metabolism (fat processing).  In theory, chromium polynicotinate improves chromium uptake and availability within the body, potentially enhancing these metabolic processes.  However, the exact mechanisms and the extent of its impact remain subject to ongoing research.


### Precautions
* **Allergies:** Individuals with known allergies to chromium or related compounds should avoid using chromium polynicotinate.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Chromium can interact with certain medications, particularly those affecting blood sugar or lipid metabolism. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications.
* **Pregnant/Breastfeeding women:** While the AI levels are considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, higher doses are not recommended without consulting a healthcare professional.
* **Kidney/Liver Disease:**  Use caution and consult a doctor before using chromium supplements if you have pre-existing kidney or liver problems, as chromium can potentially worsen these conditions.
* **Mental Health:**  Some studies suggest potential interactions with psychiatric disorders, requiring caution and consultation with a doctor before use in such patients.

### FAQs
* **Q: Is chromium polynicotinate the same as chromium picolinate?** A: No, they are different chromium compounds.  While both provide chromium, they have different chemical structures and may have slightly different absorption and effects.

* **Q: Can I get enough chromium from my diet?** A: Most people obtain sufficient chromium through a balanced diet.  Supplementation is usually only recommended if a deficiency is diagnosed.

* **Q: How should I store chromium polynicotinate?** A: Store according to the label instructions, usually in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Are there long-term studies on the safety of chromium polynicotinate?** A: Long-term studies on chromium polynicotinate specifically are limited.  More research is needed to fully understand its long-term effects.

* **Q: Can I take chromium polynicotinate without consulting a doctor?** A: While generally considered safe at recommended AI levels, it's always best to consult your doctor or a registered dietitian before starting any new supplement, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.  Self-treating can be risky.
