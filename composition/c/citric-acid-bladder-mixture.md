# Citric Acid Bladder Mixture
### Generic Name
Citric Acid Bladder Mixture

### Usage
Citric Acid Bladder Mixture is a sterile irrigation solution primarily used in the lower urinary tract to dissolve struvite or apatite bladder stones (calculi).  It's also employed to prevent encrustations on urethral catheters and cystostomy tubes.  While primarily used for bladder calculi, it may be used in certain situations for renal calculi dissolution via irrigation.  Note that its use for renal calculi is not as commonly documented as its use for bladder calculi.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Prevention of catheter/tube encrustation:** 30 mL instilled into the bladder, clamped for 10 minutes, then drained.  Repeat three times daily.
* **Bladder calculi dissolution:** 30 mL instilled, clamped for 30-60 minutes, then drained. Repeat 4-6 times daily.
* **Renal calculi (off-label use):**  Irrigation with normal saline is initiated at 60 mL/hour, gradually increasing to a maximum of 120 mL/hour or until pain or pressure elevation occurs. The Citric Acid Bladder Mixture is then infused at the maximum flow rate established with saline.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Citric Acid Bladder Mixture in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Fever
* Flank pain (transient)
* Urothelial ulceration

**Rare Post-Marketing/Case Reports:**

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Citric Acid Bladder Mixture works by a process of ion exchange. The citric acid in the solution helps lower the pH of the urine.  Magnesium ions in the solution then replace calcium ions in the stone matrix, forming soluble magnesium stones. These magnesium stones are then dissolved by the acidic environment, facilitating the breakdown and removal of the calculi.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Citric Acid Bladder Mixture is contraindicated in cases of urinary tract extravasation (leakage of urine outside the urinary tract).
* **Cautions:**  Use with caution in patients with vesicoureteral reflux (backflow of urine from the bladder to the ureters) or impaired renal function.
* **Drug Interactions:** Numerous interactions are possible due to the components of the mixture (citric acid, magnesium).  These include interactions with various medications like bisphosphonates, calcium channel blockers, certain antibiotics (quinolones), and others.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The mixture is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. While magnesium is excreted in breast milk, the excretion of other components is unknown. Caution is advised during breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does treatment typically last?** A: Treatment duration varies depending on the size and type of stones and individual response to treatment. Regular monitoring is necessary to assess progress.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop using the mixture and contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects.
* **Q: How is the mixture stored?** A: Store as directed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist, typically at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: Can I use this mixture for kidney stones?** A: While sometimes used off-label for renal calculi dissolution via irrigation, it is primarily indicated for bladder stones.  Your doctor will determine the suitability for your specific condition.
* **Q: Is this mixture suitable for everyone?** A: No, it's not suitable for everyone.  Individuals with contraindications (like urinary tract extravasation) or cautions (like renal impairment) should not use it.  Your doctor will determine if it's appropriate for you.
