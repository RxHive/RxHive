# Certolizumab Pegol
### Generic Name
Certolizumab Pegol

### Usage

Certolizumab pegol is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers.  Its primary use is to reduce the signs and symptoms of several inflammatory conditions.  Specifically, it's approved to treat:

* **Moderately to severely active Crohn's disease:** In adults who haven't responded adequately to standard treatments.  It helps manage the inflammation in the digestive tract, easing symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.
* **Moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis:** In adults, helping to reduce joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.
* **Active psoriatic arthritis:**  This medication targets the inflammation associated with psoriatic arthritis, improving joint symptoms and skin manifestations.
* **Active ankylosing spondylitis:**  Certolizumab pegol helps manage the inflammation and pain in the spine and surrounding joints characteristic of this condition.
* **Nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA):**  It helps alleviate symptoms in adults with this type of arthritis, which affects the spine,  when there are objective signs of inflammation.
* **Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis:**  This medication can effectively reduce the inflammation and scaling associated with this chronic skin condition.


### Dosage

Certolizumab pegol is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) via injection.  Dosage varies depending on the specific condition being treated and the patient's response.  **It's crucial to follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider precisely.**  The following is a summary and should not replace personalized medical advice:

* **Crohn's Disease:**  Typically starts with a 400 mg loading dose (given as two 200mg injections), followed by doses at weeks 2 and 4, then 400 mg every 4 weeks for maintenance.

* **Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, and nr-axSpA:** Usually begins with a 400 mg loading dose (two 200 mg injections), followed by doses at weeks 2 and 4.  Maintenance dosing may vary;  200 mg every other week or 400 mg every four weeks are common options, depending on individual response. It may be used alone or in combination with methotrexate.

* **Plaque Psoriasis:**  Commonly involves 400 mg every other week.  For individuals weighing 90 kg or less, an alternative starting regimen might be considered: 400 mg at weeks 0, 2, and 4, then 200 mg every other week.


**Pediatric Use:**  Certolizumab pegol is not approved for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are generally recommended for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, but this should always be discussed with a doctor.  Treatment may be discontinued in the event of hypersensitivity reactions, serious infection, sepsis, or hepatitis B reactivation.


### Side Effects

Like all medications, Certolizumab pegol can cause side effects.  The frequency and severity vary from person to person.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Nausea
* Infection (upper respiratory tract infections are common)
* Development of antibodies to the drug


**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Skin rash
* Urinary tract infection
* Increased liver enzymes
* Injection site reactions
* Serious infections (including tuberculosis, fungal infections, and opportunistic infections)  This is a significant concern and requires immediate medical attention.


**Rare but Severe Side Effects (reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports):**

This list is not exhaustive, and other adverse reactions are possible.  See the detailed adverse drug reaction section for more.  The occurrence of any concerning side effects warrants immediate consultation with a healthcare provider.



### How it Works

Certolizumab pegol is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets and neutralizes tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).  TNF-alpha is a protein involved in inflammation. By blocking its action, Certolizumab pegol reduces the inflammatory response in the body, thereby alleviating the symptoms of the conditions it treats. Its pegylation allows for a longer half-life in the body, meaning less frequent dosing is required.  Because it lacks a certain antibody region, it avoids some of the potential side effects associated with other TNF-blocking agents.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Certolizumab pegol should not be used in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or its components, active tuberculosis or other serious infections, or moderate-to-severe heart failure.

* **Interactions:**  Avoid concurrent use of live vaccines. Anakinra, an interleukin-1 antagonist, should also be used with caution due to increased risk of infections when taken with a TNF-blocker.

* **Warnings:** Patients are at increased risk of serious infections (including tuberculosis) and certain types of cancer.  Those with pre-existing autoimmune diseases, hematologic disorders, or a history of heart failure need careful monitoring.  Testing for latent tuberculosis is crucial before and during treatment.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a doctor as this medication can be excreted in breast milk.

* **Specific Populations:**  Special considerations are necessary for pregnant or breastfeeding women, the elderly, and individuals with compromised immune systems.


### FAQs
