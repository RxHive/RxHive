# Ciclosporin
### Generic Name
Ciclosporin (also known as cyclosporine)

### Usage
Ciclosporin is an immunosuppressant drug primarily used to prevent organ rejection after transplantation. This means it helps the body accept a transplanted organ, such as a kidney, liver, heart, or lung, by suppressing the immune system's response that would otherwise attack the foreign tissue.  Its effectiveness lies in its ability to reduce the activity of T cells, a crucial component of the immune system responsible for initiating rejection.

Beyond transplantation, ciclosporin also finds application in treating certain autoimmune diseases.  These are conditions where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues.  Examples include severe rheumatoid arthritis (when other treatments have failed), severe psoriasis (a chronic skin condition), and severe uveitis (inflammation of the eye).  Its use in these conditions is often reserved for cases that haven't responded adequately to other therapies due to its potential for significant side effects.


### Dosage

Ciclosporin dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's weight, the specific condition being treated, and the response to the medication.  It's crucial to follow the doctor's prescribed dosage precisely.  There isn't a universally applicable dosage chart, as it is determined on a case-by-case basis.

**Oral Administration:** Ciclosporin is available in various oral forms, including capsules and solutions.  Dosage is typically measured in milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) per day, and divided into two or more doses.

**Intravenous (IV) Administration:** For certain situations, such as immediately after transplantation, ciclosporin is administered intravenously. The IV dosage is also determined individually by the physician, usually based on weight and clinical needs.  It is often a higher initial dose than the oral equivalent.

**Pediatric Use:**  Dosage in children is calculated based on weight and requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Ciclosporin can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially serious.  It's crucial to report any unusual symptoms to a doctor immediately.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Tremors
* Headaches
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* High blood pressure
* Increased hair growth (hirsutism)
* Gum overgrowth


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Kidney problems (nephrotoxicity) – This is a significant concern and requires regular monitoring of kidney function.
* Liver problems (hepatotoxicity) – Liver function tests are usually performed regularly.
* Infections – The immunosuppressive effect increases susceptibility to infections.
* High blood sugar (hyperglycemia)
* Lymphomas (a type of cancer) – Increased risk in long-term use.


### How it Works

Ciclosporin works by inhibiting calcineurin, an enzyme crucial for the activation of T lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).  T lymphocytes play a central role in the immune response, initiating the rejection of transplanted organs and contributing to the damaging inflammation seen in autoimmune diseases. By blocking calcineurin, ciclosporin effectively dampens the immune system’s response, preventing organ rejection and reducing the inflammation associated with autoimmune disorders.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ciclosporin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug.
* **Drug Interactions:** Ciclosporin interacts with numerous other medications.  It's crucial to inform the doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken. Some interactions can significantly alter the effectiveness or increase the risk of side effects of both drugs.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ciclosporin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks to the fetus.  It's generally advised to avoid breastfeeding while taking ciclosporin.
* **Kidney and Liver Function:**  Regular monitoring of kidney and liver function is essential during ciclosporin therapy, especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney or liver conditions.
* **Infections:**  Patients should be vigilant about signs of infection and seek medical attention promptly.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, requiring careful dosage adjustment and monitoring.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long do I need to take ciclosporin?** A: The duration of treatment varies widely depending on the condition and individual response.  It can range from a few months to many years, particularly in transplantation.

* **Q: Can I stop taking ciclosporin suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking ciclosporin abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can lead to serious complications.

* **Q: How should I store ciclosporin?** A: Store ciclosporin as directed on the label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking ciclosporin?** A:  Alcohol can interact with ciclosporin and potentially increase the risk of side effects.  It's best to avoid excessive alcohol consumption while on this medication.  Consult your doctor.

* **Q: Are there any alternatives to ciclosporin?** A: Yes, other immunosuppressants are available, but the choice of medication depends on the specific condition and individual factors.  Discuss alternatives with your doctor.
