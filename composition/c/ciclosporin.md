# Ciclosporin

**Generic Name:** Ciclosporin (also spelled Cyclosporine)

**Usage:**

Ciclosporin is an immunosuppressant drug primarily used to prevent organ rejection after transplantation (kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, bone marrow).  It's also used to treat certain autoimmune diseases, including:

* **Severe rheumatoid arthritis:** When other treatments haven't been effective.
* **Psoriasis:** Particularly severe cases that don't respond to other treatments.
* **Atopic dermatitis (eczema):**  Severe cases unresponsive to other therapies.
* **Nephrotic syndrome:** In specific cases, particularly in children.
* **Uveitis:**  Inflammation of the eye.
* **Beh√ßet's disease:**  A rare inflammatory disorder.


**Side Effects:**

Ciclosporin can cause a wide range of side effects, some mild and others serious.  The severity and frequency vary depending on the dosage and individual factors.  Common side effects include:

* **Kidney problems:**  Reduced kidney function, high blood pressure, elevated creatinine levels. This is a major concern and requires regular monitoring.
* **High blood pressure (hypertension):** Requires monitoring and may need medication to control.
* **Tremor:** Shaking or trembling.
* **Headache:** Can be mild or severe.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Gastrointestinal upset.
* **Diarrhea:**  Can be mild or severe.
* **Increased hair growth (hirsutism):**  More noticeable in women.
* **Gum hyperplasia (overgrowth):**  Can affect oral hygiene.
* **Increased risk of infection:**  Due to immunosuppressive effects.
* **Increased risk of certain cancers:**  Long-term use is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma and other cancers.
* **Liver damage:**  Abnormal liver function tests.


**Rare but serious side effects include:**

* **Seizures:**  Rare but potentially life-threatening.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Anaphylaxis.


**How it Works:**

Ciclosporin works by suppressing the activity of the immune system.  Specifically, it inhibits the production of certain proteins (lymphokines) that are crucial for T-cell activation. T-cells are a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in initiating immune responses. By suppressing T-cell activity, ciclosporin reduces the body's ability to reject transplanted organs and also helps manage the excessive immune response seen in autoimmune diseases.


**FAQs:**

* **How is ciclosporin administered?**  It's typically given orally (as capsules or solution) but can also be administered intravenously in certain situations.
* **How long does it take to work?** The effects on organ rejection are immediate, while effects on autoimmune diseases may take weeks or months to become noticeable.
* **What are the precautions before taking ciclosporin?**  Inform your doctor about all your current medications, allergies, and medical conditions, particularly kidney or liver problems.  Regular blood tests are essential to monitor kidney function and other side effects.
* **Can ciclosporin be taken with other medications?**  It can interact with many drugs; inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Is ciclosporin safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  It's generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to potential risks to the baby. Discuss this thoroughly with your doctor.
* **Can I stop taking ciclosporin abruptly?** No, you should never stop taking ciclosporin abruptly, as this can lead to serious complications, especially in transplant patients.  The dosage should be tapered down gradually under the supervision of your doctor.
