# Cetirizine + Ambroxol

**Generic Name:** Cetirizine + Ambroxol

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat symptoms of the common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections.  Cetirizine is an antihistamine that helps relieve runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes. Ambroxol is an expectorant that helps loosen and thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.  It's often used to alleviate symptoms like cough with phlegm.  **Always follow the dosage instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.**  This medication is not suitable for all conditions and shouldn't be used without a professional's recommendation.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Cetirizine + Ambroxol can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Cetirizine related:** drowsiness, headache, dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness.
* **Ambroxol related:** nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset.
* **Less common but more serious:** allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing),  fast heartbeat.

This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Cetirizine:** This antihistamine works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  By blocking histamine, it reduces symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes.
* **Ambroxol:** This expectorant works by increasing the production of a fluid in the lungs that helps to thin and loosen mucus. This makes it easier to cough up the phlegm, thereby relieving congestion and cough.
