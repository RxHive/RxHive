# Chorionic Gonadotropin Alfa, Recombinant
### Generic Name
Chorionic Gonadotropin Alfa, Recombinant

### Usage

Chorionic gonadotropin alfa (recombinant) plays a crucial role in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and ovulation induction.  Its primary use is within ART programs to trigger ovulation in infertile women who have undergone pretreatment with follicle-stimulating hormones (FSH).  This is typically done after optimal follicular growth has been achieved, as determined by monitoring.  Secondly, it's indicated for ovulation induction and subsequent pregnancy in anovulatory infertile women where the infertility is functional and not caused by primary ovarian failure.  In essence, it helps the final maturation of the egg and triggers its release.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The dosage varies depending on the specific application:

* **Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART):**  A subcutaneous injection of 250 mcg is administered 24-48 hours after the last dose of FSH or human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG),  once optimal follicular growth is confirmed.

* **Ovulation Induction (OI):** A subcutaneous injection of 250 mcg is given 24-48 hours after optimal follicular growth is reached, as determined by monitoring.


**Children:** The safety and efficacy of chorionic gonadotropin alfa (recombinant) in children have not been established.  Therefore, it's not recommended for use in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic or renal impairment, as safety and efficacy have not been established in these patient populations.


### Side Effects

**Common (2-10%):**

* Injection site pain, bruising, inflammation, or reaction

**Less Common (<2%):**

* Injection site inflammation and reaction
* Flatulence
* Diarrhea
* Hiccups
* Ectopic pregnancy
* Breast pain
* Intermenstrual bleeding/Vaginal hemorrhage
* Cervical lesions

* Cervical carcinoma


**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Chorionic gonadotropin alfa (recombinant) is a bioengineered version of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). It works by binding to luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin (LH/CG) receptors located on ovarian cells (theca and granulosa cells). This binding mimics the natural surge of LH that triggers the final maturation of the follicle and subsequent ovulation. The resulting ovulation allows for fertilization and potential pregnancy.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to hCG or any formulation component.
* Primary ovarian failure.
* Uncontrolled thyroid or adrenal dysfunction.
* Uncontrolled organic intracranial lesions (e.g., pituitary tumors).
* Abnormal uterine bleeding of undetermined origin.
* Ovarian cysts or enlargement of undetermined origin.
* Sex hormone-dependent tumors of the reproductive tract and accessory organs.
* Pregnancy.


**Warnings:** Increased risks of ovarian enlargement, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), thromboembolism, multiple births, pulmonary and vascular complications, reproductive system neoplasms, and ectopic pregnancy are associated with the use of this medication.


**Use with Caution:**  Use with caution in elderly patients.


### FAQs

**Q: How is chorionic gonadotropin alfa administered?**
A: It's administered subcutaneously (under the skin) via injection.


**Q: How is the dosage determined?**
A: Dosage is determined by the healthcare provider based on the individual's condition and response to treatment, typically within an ART or OI program.  Close monitoring is crucial.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately for guidance.


**Q: How should I store this medication?**
A: Store as directed by your pharmacist or healthcare provider, usually refrigerated.


**Q: Are there any long-term effects?**
A: Long-term effects are generally not anticipated with appropriate monitoring and use under the supervision of a healthcare professional. However, the potential for rare long-term complications related to OHSS, multiple pregnancies, or other reproductive system issues should be noted.


**Q: Can I take other medications while using this drug?**
A: Inform your healthcare provider of all medications, herbal remedies, or supplements you are taking to assess potential interactions.
