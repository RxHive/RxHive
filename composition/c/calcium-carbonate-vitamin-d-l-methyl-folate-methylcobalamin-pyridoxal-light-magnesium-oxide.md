# Calcium Carbonate + Vitamin D + L-Methyl Folate + Methylcobalamin + Pyridoxal- + Light Magnesium Oxide

**Generic Name:** Calcium Carbonate + Vitamin D + L-Methyl Folate + Methylcobalamin + Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate + Light Magnesium Oxide

**Usage:** This combination of nutrients is primarily used to address nutritional deficiencies and support overall health, particularly bone health and neurological function.  It's not a treatment for specific diseases in itself, but rather a supplement to improve nutrient levels.  The individual components address different aspects of health:

* **Calcium Carbonate:**  Crucial for strong bones and teeth.  Deficiencies can lead to osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and rickets.
* **Vitamin D:** Essential for calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and overall well-being. Deficiency can contribute to osteoporosis, muscle weakness, and increased risk of infections.
* **L-Methylfolate:** The active form of folate (vitamin B9), vital for cell growth, DNA synthesis, and preventing neural tube defects in developing fetuses. Deficiency can lead to anemia and neurological problems.
* **Methylcobalamin:** The active form of vitamin B12, crucial for nerve function, red blood cell production, and DNA synthesis. Deficiency can cause anemia, nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy), and cognitive impairment.
* **Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (P5P):** The active form of vitamin B6, involved in numerous metabolic processes, including red blood cell formation, neurotransmitter synthesis, and immune function. Deficiency can cause anemia, skin problems, and neurological issues.
* **Light Magnesium Oxide:**  Magnesium is important for muscle and nerve function, blood sugar control, and blood pressure regulation. Deficiency can lead to muscle cramps, weakness, and fatigue.

This combination is often recommended for individuals with diagnosed deficiencies or those at risk due to dietary restrictions, malabsorption issues, or certain medical conditions.  It may also be used as supportive therapy alongside other treatments.  It's crucial to understand that this supplement does *not* replace a balanced diet and medical advice.


**Dosage:** Dosage varies considerably depending on individual needs and the specific product formulation.  Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by your healthcare provider.  There are no universally standardized dosages for this specific combination. Adult doses generally range from one to two tablets per day, but this can change significantly.  Pediatric dosages should always be determined by a doctor based on age, weight, and health status.  This supplement is typically available in tablet form.


**Side Effects:**

* **Common:**  Constipation, mild upset stomach, gas.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels), kidney stones (especially with pre-existing kidney conditions), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).

**Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, stop taking the supplement and consult a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:** Each component works independently to improve nutrient levels in the body. Calcium carbonate provides calcium, while Vitamin D facilitates calcium absorption. The B vitamins (folate, B12, and B6) play crucial roles in numerous metabolic processes, particularly in cell growth and neurological function.  Magnesium supports various bodily functions, from muscle contractions to blood sugar regulation.


**Popular Brand Names (India):**  Specific brand names vary widely in India.  It's best to check with a local pharmacist for available brands containing this combination of nutrients.  Many supplements may not list all components explicitly, so careful review of the ingredients list is essential.
