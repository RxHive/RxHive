# Cyclobenzaprine
### Generic Name
Cyclobenzaprine

### Usage
Cyclobenzaprine is primarily used as a muscle relaxant.  It's prescribed as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for the short-term (2-3 weeks) management of muscle spasms related to acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions.  This means it's used *alongside* other treatments, not as a standalone cure.  While its primary use is for muscle spasms, it's sometimes used off-label for conditions like fibromyalgia and acute temporomandibular disorder (TMD), but this should only be done under the strict guidance of a physician.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the medication's form (immediate-release or extended-release), the patient's age, and the condition being treated.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Muscle Spasms (Immediate-Release):**  The typical starting dose is 5 mg three times a day (TID), possibly with one dose at bedtime.  This can be increased to a maximum of 10 mg TID, based on response and tolerability.  A once-daily dose at bedtime, combined with daytime use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen, might be better tolerated by some individuals.  The use should be temporary, for only a few days or intermittently as needed.

* **Muscle Spasms (Extended-Release):** The usual dose is 15 mg once daily (OD).  Some patients may need up to 30 mg OD.

* **Fibromyalgia (Off-Label, Immediate-Release):**  The starting dose is typically 5-10 mg OD at bedtime. The dose can be gradually increased up to 10-40 mg daily, split into 1-3 doses.  If sedation is excessive, the largest dose should be taken at bedtime.

* **Acute TMD (Off-Label, Immediate-Release):** The usual dose is 5-10 mg OD at bedtime for 10-14 days; some patients may need an extra week.


**Children:**

Cyclobenzaprine is generally not recommended for children younger than 15 years old.  Adolescents aged 15 and older may use the immediate-release tablets, starting at 5 mg TID, with a maximum dose of 10 mg TID.  Treatment should be limited to 2-3 weeks.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Extended-release is not recommended for patients with mild to severe liver impairment. Immediate-release should be used cautiously with a starting dose of 5 mg and careful titration in patients with mild impairment; it's generally not recommended for those with moderate to severe impairment.

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment might not always be necessary for patients with mild to severe kidney problems, but caution is advised due to limited data.  Dialysis is unlikely to remove cyclobenzaprine, but caution is still warranted.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Upset stomach

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Confusion
* Decreased mental acuity
* Blurred vision
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Hallucinations
* Seizures
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition)

If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or unusual, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Cyclobenzaprine is a centrally acting muscle relaxant.  It works by reducing the activity of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle contractions.  This reduces muscle spasms without impairing normal muscle function.  Chemically, it is related to tricyclic antidepressants but is used for its muscle relaxing properties.  

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cyclobenzaprine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, heart failure, arrhythmias, heart block, conduction disturbances, recent myocardial infarction, hyperthyroidism, or those who have used MAO inhibitors within the past 14 days.

* **Drug Interactions:** Cyclobenzaprine can interact with many other drugs, particularly those that affect the central nervous system (CNS) or are metabolized by the liver.  This can lead to increased drowsiness, sedation, or other adverse effects.  Be sure to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Cyclobenzaprine is classified as a Category B drug during pregnancy (animal studies haven't shown risk to the fetus, but human studies are lacking).  It's unclear whether it's excreted in breast milk; the benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed against potential risks to the infant.

* **Elderly and Vulnerable Populations:** Older adults are more susceptible to drowsiness and dizziness with cyclobenzaprine.  Lower doses are usually recommended.  Patients with liver or kidney impairment require careful monitoring and dosage adjustment.

* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how cyclobenzaprine affects you, as drowsiness is a common side effect.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for cyclobenzaprine to work?** A: The onset of effects can vary, but you may notice some relief within an hour or two of taking an immediate-release tablet.  Extended-release capsules provide more sustained relief.

* **Q: Can I stop taking cyclobenzaprine suddenly?** A:  It's best not to stop taking cyclobenzaprine abruptly.  Your doctor may recommend a gradual tapering of the dose to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: How should I store cyclobenzaprine?** A: Store the medication in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Is cyclobenzaprine addictive?** A:  Cyclobenzaprine does have a potential for dependence, but it's not typically considered highly addictive.  Still, itâ€™s crucial to follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and duration of treatment.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking cyclobenzaprine?** A:  Avoid alcohol while taking cyclobenzaprine.  Alcohol can enhance the sedative effects of the drug, increasing the risk of drowsiness, dizziness, and impaired coordination.
