**Generic Name:** Ceftazidime/Tazobactam

**Usage:** Ceftazidime/Tazobactam is a combination antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, including:

* **Serious respiratory tract infections:**  Pneumonia, bronchitis, and other lung infections.
* **Skin and skin structure infections:**  Cellulitis, abscesses, and wound infections.

* **Infections in patients with neutropenia (low white blood cell count):**  Often seen in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.


It's important to note that this antibiotic is only effective against certain types of bacteria and should only be used when prescribed by a doctor.  It is not effective against viral infections (like the common cold or flu).


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Ceftazidime/Tazobactam can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Abdominal pain**
* **Headache**
* **Rash**
* **Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)**
* **Elevated liver enzymes (seen in blood tests)**
* **Pseudomembranous colitis (a serious bowel infection)** â€“ characterized by severe diarrhea.


Serious but less common side effects include:

* **Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to life-threatening anaphylaxis)**
* **Seizures**
* **Kidney problems**
* **Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff)** - a serious bowel infection.


This list is not exhaustive, and you should consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects and how to manage them.


**How it Works:** Ceftazidime/Tazobactam is a combination of two antibiotics:

* **Ceftazidime:**  A cephalosporin antibiotic that works by interfering with the bacteria's ability to build its cell walls, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.
* **Tazobactam:** A beta-lactamase inhibitor. Many bacteria produce beta-lactamases, enzymes that break down cephalosporins like ceftazidime, rendering them ineffective. Tazobactam inhibits these enzymes, allowing ceftazidime to work effectively against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant.


Together, they provide broader coverage against a wider range of bacteria than ceftazidime alone.
