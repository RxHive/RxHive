# Ceftazidime + Tazobactum
### Generic Name
Ceftazidime/Tazobactam

### Usage

Ceftazidime/Tazobactam is a combination antibiotic used to treat a wide range of serious bacterial infections.  It's particularly effective against bacteria that have become resistant to other antibiotics.  The primary use is for treating infections affecting the lungs (pneumonia, including hospital-acquired pneumonia), urinary tract (complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis), abdomen (intra-abdominal infections), skin and soft tissues (skin infections, cellulitis), and bloodstream (bacteremia, sepsis).  It's also used to treat infections in patients who are immunocompromised or have other conditions making them susceptible to severe bacterial infections.  In some cases, it might be used for the treatment of infections caused by specific bacteria like *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Enterobacteriaceae*, which are known for their antibiotic resistance.


### Dosage

Dosage of Ceftazidime/Tazobactam varies greatly depending on the type and severity of infection, patient age, weight, and kidney function.  It's crucial to follow the prescription precisely as directed by a healthcare professional.  The information below is for general understanding and should not replace professional medical advice.

**Typical Adult Dosage (Intravenous):**  The standard intravenous dose is usually 1.5-2 grams of Ceftazidime/Tazobactam (as a combination) every 8 or 12 hours.  The duration of treatment depends on the infection's response and is determined by the doctor.

**Pediatric Dosage (Intravenous):** Pediatric dosing is weight-based and is determined by the physician considering the age and severity of infection. Itâ€™s typically calculated in mg/kg of body weight.  Intramuscular administration isn't generally recommended for children.


**Oral Dosage:**  Ceftazidime/Tazobactam is not available in an oral form.  It is administered intravenously (IV).


**Important Considerations:**  Patients with kidney problems often require adjustments to the dosage.  Older adults may also require dose adjustments due to reduced kidney function.  Liver function can also be a factor in determining appropriate dosage.  Always inform your physician of any pre-existing medical conditions, including kidney or liver disease.



### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Rash
* Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness)


Less common, but more serious side effects that require immediate medical attention include:

* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue)
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (severe, watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps)
* Changes in liver function tests
* Seizures (especially in patients with pre-existing conditions)
* Blood disorders (such as neutropenia)


This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, immediately contact your doctor or healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Ceftazidime/Tazobactam is a beta-lactam antibiotic.  Ceftazidime is a cephalosporin that works by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, leading to bacterial cell death. Tazobactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor, meaning it protects Ceftazidime from being broken down by bacterial enzymes (beta-lactamases). Many bacteria produce these enzymes to resist the action of antibiotics like Ceftazidime.  By including Tazobactam, the combined drug is effective against a wider range of bacteria, including those resistant to Ceftazidime alone.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Individuals with a known allergy to penicillin or other cephalosporin antibiotics should not take Ceftazidime/Tazobactam.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ceftazidime/Tazobactam may interact with certain other medications, including those that affect kidney function or blood clotting.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of Ceftazidime/Tazobactam during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered, weighing the potential benefits against the potential risks.  Consult your healthcare provider.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Dosage adjustments are usually necessary for patients with impaired kidney function.
* **Bleeding Disorders:**  Ceftazidime/Tazobactam may increase the risk of bleeding in individuals with bleeding disorders.
* **Superinfections:**  Like other antibiotics, long-term use of Ceftazidime/Tazobactam can lead to the overgrowth of other microorganisms, potentially causing superinfections.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The time it takes to notice improvement depends on the type and severity of the infection.  You may see some improvement within a few days, but the full course of treatment is usually required for complete resolution.

* **Q: Can I take it with other medications?** A:  Always inform your healthcare provider about all other medications you're taking, as interactions may occur.

* **Q: How should I store it?** A:  Ceftazidime/Tazobactam is an injectable medication administered in a hospital setting; storage guidelines will be determined by the healthcare facility.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to determine the best course of action.  Do not double the next dose.

* **Q: Is it safe to drive or operate machinery while taking it?** A: Side effects like dizziness or drowsiness are possible. If you experience such side effects, avoid driving or operating machinery until they subside.  Follow your healthcare provider's advice.

* **Q: Can I stop taking it once I feel better?** A:  No, completing the full course of treatment as prescribed is essential to ensure the infection is completely eradicated and prevent the development of antibiotic resistance.
