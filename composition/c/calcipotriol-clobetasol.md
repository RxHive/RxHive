# Calcipotriol + Clobetasol

**Generic Name:** Calcipotriol/Clobetasol Propionate

**Usage:**  This combination medication is a topical treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  It's used to reduce the inflammation and scaling associated with the condition. It's typically applied to affected skin areas once or twice daily, as directed by a doctor.  The duration of treatment is determined by the physician and usually involves periods of use followed by periods where the medication is stopped to minimize the risk of side effects.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Calcipotriol/Clobetasol Propionate can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness, dryness, peeling, or rash at the application site.
* **Folliculitis:** Inflammation of hair follicles.
* **Skin atrophy:** Thinning of the skin.  This is more likely with prolonged use.
* **Striae (stretch marks):**  Especially noticeable with prolonged use.
* **Hypertrichosis (increased hair growth):**  More common in areas with hair follicles.
* **Hypopigmentation (lightening of the skin):** Can occur at the application site.
* **Acne:** In some individuals.


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms such as hives, swelling, difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* **Systemic absorption:** While rare, prolonged or extensive use can lead to absorption of the medication into the bloodstream, potentially causing systemic side effects.  This is more likely in children and those applying the medication over large areas.


**How it Works:** This combination medication works by combining two active ingredients:

* **Calcipotriol:** This is a vitamin D analogue.  It works by slowing down the growth of skin cells, reducing the inflammation and scaling characteristic of psoriasis.
* **Clobetasol Propionate:** This is a potent corticosteroid.  It reduces inflammation and suppresses the immune system in the skin, helping to reduce the redness, itching, and scaling of psoriasis.  The combination of these two ingredients provides a more effective treatment than either alone.

* **What if I experience side effects?**  Mild side effects usually resolve once you stop using the medication.  If you experience severe or persistent side effects, contact your doctor immediately.
* **Is this medication addictive?**  No, it is not considered addictive.  However, prolonged use can lead to skin thinning and other side effects.
