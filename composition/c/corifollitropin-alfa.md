# Corifollitropin Alfa
### Generic Name
Corifollitropin Alfa

### Usage

Corifollitropin alfa is a gonadotropin used in assisted reproductive technology (ART) to stimulate the growth of multiple follicles in women's ovaries.  It's specifically used in conjunction with a GnRH antagonist to enhance the chances of successful egg retrieval for procedures like in-vitro fertilization (IVF).  This medication is not suitable for all women; a thorough evaluation of infertility causes and the male partner's fertility is crucial before starting treatment.  Corifollitropin alfa is not used to treat infertility on its own; it is part of a larger ART protocol.


### Dosage

**Adult Females (in ART):**  Dosage depends on weight and age.

* **Patients weighing ≤60 kg and aged ≤36 years:** A single subcutaneous injection of 100 mcg on day 1 of the menstrual cycle.
* **Patients weighing >60 kg, regardless of age:** A single subcutaneous injection of 150 mcg on day 1 of the menstrual cycle.

Treatment is initiated in the early follicular phase.  If the ovarian response is adequate (monitored by ultrasound and estradiol levels), a GnRH antagonist is given on days 5 or 6.  From day 8 onward, treatment continues with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).  Once sufficient follicle development is observed, hCG is administered.  If ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a concern, the dosage may be adjusted or treatment withheld temporarily.  Close monitoring and adherence to clinical guidelines to mitigate OHSS risk are essential.

**Pediatric Use:** Corifollitropin alfa is not approved for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's label doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment.  Renal impairment contraindicates the use of Corifollitropin alfa.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, breast tenderness, pelvic pain.
* **Less Common, but Serious:** Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), thrombosis, ovarian torsion, neoplasms (reproductive system).

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.  It's vital to report any unusual or concerning symptoms to your healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Corifollitropin alfa is a modified version of recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).  The addition of a carboxy-terminal peptide prolongs its action.  FSH is naturally involved in the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles. Corifollitropin alfa enhances this process, leading to the development of multiple mature follicles, thus increasing the number of eggs available for retrieval in ART procedures.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to corifollitropin alfa or any formulation component.
* Ovarian, breast, uterine, pituitary, or hypothalamic tumors.
* Unexplained vaginal bleeding.
* Primary ovarian failure.
* Ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries.
* History of OHSS.
* Previous controlled ovarian stimulation resulting in >30 follicles ≥11 mm.
* Basal antral follicle count >20.
* Uterine fibroids or reproductive organ malformations incompatible with pregnancy.
* Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

**Warnings and Increased Risk:**  Corifollitropin alfa increases the risk of OHSS, benign and malignant ovarian/reproductive neoplasms, ovarian torsion, thromboembolic events, CNS effects, and ectopic pregnancy.

**Interactions:** Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs might enhance corifollitropin alfa's effects; combination use should be avoided.

**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Corifollitropin alfa is used within the context of ART and is contraindicated in pregnancy.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, and use is not recommended during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

**Q: How is Corifollitropin alfa administered?**
