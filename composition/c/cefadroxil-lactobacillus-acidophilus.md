# Cefadroxil + Lactobacillus Acidophilus
### Generic Name
Cefadroxil + Lactobacillus Acidophilus


### Usage

This combination medication treats bacterial infections and helps prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  Cefadroxil, a cephalosporin antibiotic, is effective against a wide range of bacteria causing infections in different parts of the body, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), skin infections, and ear infections (otitis media).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic, a beneficial bacterium that helps restore the balance of gut flora. Antibiotics, while effective against harmful bacteria, can also disrupt the natural bacterial balance in the intestines, leading to diarrhea.  The addition of Lactobacillus acidophilus aims to mitigate this side effect.  This combination is often prescribed when the benefits of preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea outweigh the potential risks of adding a probiotic. It's crucial to understand that this combination is not a replacement for appropriate antibiotic treatment; the antibiotic remains the primary treatment for the infection.

### Dosage

Dosage will vary greatly depending on the individual's age, weight, the severity of the infection, and the specific formulations of cefadroxil and Lactobacillus acidophilus used.  **It is absolutely vital to follow your doctor's prescription instructions precisely.**  There is no standardized universal dosage for this combination as formulations differ between manufacturers.

* **Cefadroxil:**  The dosage of cefadroxil is usually determined based on the patient's weight and the type of infection.  It’s typically administered orally as capsules or suspension.  Dosage for adults may range from 250mg to 1 gram per day, divided into doses, while children’s dosages are calculated based on weight and are much lower.  Intravenous administration is possible, but this would be determined by the prescribing physician based on the patient's condition and suitability for intravenous treatment.

* **Lactobacillus Acidophilus:**  Dosage for Lactobacillus acidophilus will vary depending on the specific product used. It is often given in capsule or tablet form, and dosages are typically stated on the product label.  It is usually taken separately, not mixed with the cefadroxil. It’s best to check the individual product instructions and follow them carefully.

**Important Note:**  This information is for general understanding.  Never attempt to self-dose or alter the prescribed dosage.  Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dosage for your specific situation.

### How it Works

Cefadroxil works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to build their cell walls, leading to their death. This inhibits the growth and spread of the bacteria causing the infection. Lactobacillus acidophilus, a probiotic, works by colonizing the gut and competing with harmful bacteria for resources, helping to restore the gut's natural microbial balance.  This competition helps reduce the overgrowth of harmful bacteria that can cause diarrhea – a common side effect of antibiotics.


### Precautions

* **Drug Interactions:** Cefadroxil may interact with certain medications. Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your doctor.
