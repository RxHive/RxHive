# Calcium + Vitamin D

**Generic Name:** Calcium carbonate/Calcium citrate + Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3)  *(Note:  The specific calcium salt – carbonate or citrate – and the form of Vitamin D – D2 or D3 – will vary depending on the manufacturer.  This is a general example.)*

**Usage:**

* **Calcium:**  Supplementing calcium intake to prevent or treat calcium deficiency.  Common uses include osteoporosis prevention and treatment, hypocalcemia (low blood calcium), and supporting bone health.  May also be used for other conditions as directed by a physician.
* **Vitamin D:**  Supplementing Vitamin D levels to prevent or treat Vitamin D deficiency (hypovitaminosis D).  Vitamin D is crucial for calcium absorption and bone health.  It also plays a role in immune function and other bodily processes.  Prescriptions for vitamin D supplementation often exist alongside calcium supplementation for this reason.

**Side Effects:**

* **Calcium:** Constipation, gas, bloating, nausea.  High doses can lead to hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), kidney stones (especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney problems), and digestive upset.
* **Vitamin D:** Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, constipation, weakness, fatigue.  High doses can lead to hypercalcemia, kidney problems, and potentially other serious issues.


**How it Works:**

* **Calcium:** Calcium is a crucial mineral for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth.  It's involved in numerous bodily functions, including muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.
* **Vitamin D:** Vitamin D aids in the absorption of calcium from the intestines.  It also plays a role in regulating calcium levels in the blood and promoting bone mineralization.  The combination ensures that the calcium is effectively utilized by the body for bone health.
