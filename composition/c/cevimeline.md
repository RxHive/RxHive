# Cevimeline
### Generic Name
Cevimeline

### Usage
Cevimeline is primarily used to treat the dry mouth (xerostomia) symptom experienced by individuals with Sjögren's syndrome.  This autoimmune disease attacks the glands that produce saliva, tears, and other bodily fluids, leading to significant dryness. Cevimeline helps stimulate the production of saliva, offering relief from the discomfort and complications associated with dry mouth.  It's crucial to understand that cevimeline treats the symptom of dry mouth and not the underlying Sjögren's syndrome itself.

### Dosage

**Adults (Xerostomia associated with Sjögren's syndrome):** The typical dose is 30 mg taken orally three times a day (TID).

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of cevimeline in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance on dosing in individuals with compromised liver or kidney function.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

*   Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
*   Nausea
*   Sinusitis, rhinitis, and upper respiratory tract infections


**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less, including post-marketing reports):**  These are not exhaustive, and others can occur.  See the detailed list below for a more comprehensive overview.  Consult your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.

*   Cardiovascular problems (chest pain, palpitations, edema)
*   Gastrointestinal issues (abdominal pain, vomiting, severe diarrhea)
*   Neurological effects (fatigue, insomnia, headache, dizziness)
*   Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)

### How it Works
Cevimeline is a cholinergic agonist, meaning it mimics the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that activates muscarinic receptors in the body. By binding to these receptors, cevimeline stimulates the salivary glands to produce more saliva, thereby alleviating the dry mouth associated with Sjögren's syndrome.  It also affects other muscarinic receptors, potentially explaining some of the side effects.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Cevimeline is contraindicated in patients with:

*   Known hypersensitivity to cevimeline or any of its components.
*   Uncontrolled asthma.
*   Conditions where constriction of the pupils (miosis) is undesirable (e.g., narrow-angle glaucoma, acute iritis).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

*   Increased risk of parasympathomimetic effects (e.g., bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory distress).
*   Increased risk of visual effects (blurred vision, decreased visual acuity).
*   Use with caution in patients with significant cardiovascular disease (angina, myocardial infarction), a history of gallstones (cholelithiasis), a history of kidney stones (nephrolithiasis), or controlled asthma, COPD, or chronic bronchitis.
*   Pregnancy Category C:  The potential risks to a developing fetus are unknown.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before taking cevimeline if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
*   Avoid driving at night or engaging in hazardous activities in low-light conditions due to potential visual side effects.
