# Cellulose
### Generic Name
Cellulose

### Usage
Cellulose is primarily used as a bulk-forming laxative to treat constipation. It adds bulk to the stool, making it easier to pass.  This helps relieve symptoms like infrequent bowel movements, hard stools, and straining during bowel movements.  While not a treatment for constipation itself, it effectively manages the symptoms.  Secondary uses might include helping to lower cholesterol levels, though more research is needed to definitively establish this benefit. It's also sometimes used to treat diverticular disease, helping to prevent complications by adding bulk to the stool and promoting regular bowel movements.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific product and the individual's needs. Always follow the instructions on the product label.  Generally, for adults, a starting dose might range from 5 to 10 grams daily, gradually increasing as needed, under the guidance of a doctor. Children's dosages should always be determined by a pediatrician.  Different forms exist, including tablets, capsules, and powders.  Powder forms are often mixed with water or juice before consumption. It's crucial to drink plenty of water with cellulose to prevent blockage and ensure it can effectively bulk up the stool.

### Side Effects
*   Gas
*   Bloating
*   Abdominal cramping
*   Stomach discomfort
*   Allergic reactions (rare)
*   Bowel obstruction (rare, but a serious concern, especially in individuals with pre-existing bowel issues)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially severe ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Cellulose is a type of fiber that the human body cannot digest.  When ingested, it absorbs water in the digestive tract, increasing the bulk and softness of the stool. This increased bulk stimulates the bowel muscles, promoting more frequent and easier bowel movements, thus relieving constipation. It does not break down and provides no caloric value.


### Precautions
*   **Fluid Intake:**  Drinking plenty of water is crucial when taking cellulose. Insufficient fluid intake can lead to bowel obstruction.
*   **Interactions:** Cellulose may interact with certain medications.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications, especially those that require absorption from the digestive tract.
*   **Pre-existing Conditions:** Individuals with bowel obstructions, narrowed passages in the digestive tract, or certain other digestive disorders should avoid cellulose without consulting their physician.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While generally considered safe, pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult a doctor before using cellulose.
*   **Children:**  Children's dosages should be determined by a pediatrician.
