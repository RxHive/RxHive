# Calcium Citrate Malate + Vitamin D + Folic Acid

**Generic Name:** Calcium Citrate Malate + Vitamin D + Folic Acid (This is a combination product; there isn't one single generic name for all such formulations)

**Usage:**

* **Calcium Citrate Malate:**  Used to prevent and treat calcium deficiency.  It's a form of calcium that is often better absorbed than calcium carbonate, particularly in individuals with lower stomach acid.  It supports bone health, muscle function, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.
* **Vitamin D:** Essential for calcium absorption and bone health.  It also plays a role in immune function and cell growth.  Prescriptions for vitamin D are usually for correcting a deficiency; over-the-counter versions are typically for supplementation.
* **Folic Acid:** A B vitamin crucial for cell growth and development, particularly important during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects. It also plays a role in red blood cell formation.

This combination product is commonly used to:

* Supplement calcium, vitamin D, and folic acid levels in individuals with deficiencies.
* Improve bone health and density, particularly in older adults or those at risk of osteoporosis.
* Support pregnancy health (especially when a folic acid supplement is recommended).


**Side Effects:**

* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** Constipation, gas, bloating, nausea.  High doses can lead to kidney stones in susceptible individuals.
* **Vitamin D:**  High doses can cause hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels), leading to nausea, vomiting, constipation, weakness, and kidney problems.
* **Folic Acid:** Generally well-tolerated, but high doses can mask a vitamin B12 deficiency.


The specific side effects experienced will depend on the dosage and individual factors.  It's crucial to follow the recommended dosage instructions.


**How it Works:**

* **Calcium Citrate Malate:**  Provides readily absorbable calcium, which is essential for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth.
* **Vitamin D:** Enhances calcium absorption from the gut, promoting better utilization for bone health and other bodily functions.
* **Folic Acid:**  Essential coenzyme in various metabolic processes, including DNA synthesis and cell division, vital for healthy cell growth and development, especially during pregnancy.


The combination works synergistically: Vitamin D helps the body absorb the calcium from the calcium citrate malate, and folic acid contributes to overall health and cell function.
