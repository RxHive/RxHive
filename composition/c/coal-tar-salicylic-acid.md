# Coal Tar + Salicylic Acid
### Generic Name
Coal Tar + Salicylic Acid

### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used topically to treat psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis.  Coal tar helps to slow the growth of skin cells, reducing scaling and inflammation characteristic of these conditions. Salicylic acid acts as a keratolytic, meaning it helps to soften and shed the thickened, scaly skin associated with psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis.  While the primary use is for these two conditions, it may sometimes be used off-label for other skin disorders characterized by scaling and inflammation, but this should only be done under the guidance of a dermatologist.

### Dosage
Dosage depends heavily on the specific formulation (cream, ointment, shampoo, etc.), the severity of the condition, and the patient's age.  There isn't a standardized dosage across all products.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist and on the product packaging.  

**Oral Administration:** Coal tar and salicylic acid are not typically administered orally.  Ingestion can be extremely dangerous.

**Topical Administration:** Application typically involves a thin layer applied to the affected area once or twice daily, depending on the product and the severity of the condition.  For shampoos, the instructions will usually involve lathering and leaving the shampoo on the scalp for a specified time before rinsing.  Precise application instructions will vary between products, so careful reading of the product label is essential.  Children's dosages are generally determined by the doctor based on the size of the affected area and the concentration of the medication in the formulation.

**IV Administration:** Coal tar and salicylic acid are not administered intravenously.

### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Skin irritation (redness, burning, itching), dryness, and allergic reactions (rash, hives).
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Rarely, coal tar can cause photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight), leading to sunburn.  Prolonged or excessive use can also lead to skin discoloration (usually temporary).  Allergic reactions, while uncommon, can be severe in some individuals.
* **Note:** If any adverse effects occur, particularly severe reactions or those persisting despite discontinuation of use, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Coal tar's mechanism is complex and not fully understood, but it's believed to suppress the rapid growth of skin cells that leads to scaling in conditions like psoriasis.  It also has anti-inflammatory properties, helping to reduce redness and irritation.  Salicylic acid works by breaking down the bonds between skin cells, making it easier for the thickened, scaly skin to shed. This combination of slowing cell growth and promoting shedding helps to clear the skin and reduce symptoms.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  This combination should not be used on individuals with known allergies to coal tar, salicylic acid, or any other ingredient in the formulation.  It should also be avoided on open wounds or broken skin.
* **Drug Interactions:**  No significant interactions with other medications are commonly reported. However, always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be under the strict supervision of a doctor, as the safety of topical coal tar and salicylic acid during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.
* **Children:**  Use in children should be under the direction of a pediatrician or dermatologist.
* **Elderly:**  The elderly may have more sensitive skin, increasing the risk of irritation.  Start with lower concentrations and monitor for adverse effects carefully.  Always consult a physician before using this treatment on older patients.
* **Sunlight Exposure:**  Avoid prolonged sun exposure while using this medication, as coal tar can increase photosensitivity.  Use sunscreen with a high SPF if sun exposure is unavoidable.
