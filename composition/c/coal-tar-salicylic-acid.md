# Coal Tar + Salicylic Acid

**Generic Name:** Coal Tar + Salicylic Acid (various formulations exist with varying concentrations)

**Usage:**  This combination is primarily used topically to treat psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis.  It's effective in reducing scaling, itching, and inflammation associated with these conditions.  Specific application areas include the scalp (for dandruff and psoriasis), skin on the body, and sometimes the face (with caution).  Always follow the instructions on the specific product label as concentrations and application methods vary.

**Side Effects:**

* **Common:** Skin irritation, redness, burning, stinging, dryness. These are usually mild and temporary.
* **Less Common:**  Increased sun sensitivity (photosensitivity), allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling), discoloration of the skin (temporary), staining of clothing and fabrics.
* **Rare:**  Severe allergic reactions requiring immediate medical attention.

**How it Works:**

* **Coal Tar:** This is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons derived from coal. Its mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work by slowing down the rapid skin cell growth characteristic of psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. It also has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.
* **Salicylic Acid:** This is a keratolytic agent, meaning it helps to break down and remove the thickened, scaly skin associated with these conditions.  It also has some anti-inflammatory effects.

The combination of coal tar and salicylic acid offers synergistic effects, with each ingredient complementing the other's action for improved treatment efficacy.
