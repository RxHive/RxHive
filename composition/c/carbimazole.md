# Carbimazole

**Generic Name:** Carbimazole

**Usage:** Carbimazole is an antithyroid medication used to treat hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).  This includes conditions like Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goiter. It's also sometimes used to prepare patients for thyroid surgery or radioactive iodine therapy.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Mild:**  Headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, skin rash, itching, joint pain, taste changes (metallic taste).
* **More Serious (require immediate medical attention):**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), unusual bleeding or bruising, fever, sore throat, swollen glands, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.  These indicate a serious problem and require immediate medical attention.
* **Rare but serious:**  Agranulocytosis (a severe decrease in white blood cells, increasing risk of infection), cholestatic jaundice (liver damage), hepatitis.  Regular blood tests are essential to monitor for these complications.
* **Long-term use:**  Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a common side effect of long-term use and may require lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

**How it Works:** Carbimazole is a thionamide.  It works by preventing the thyroid gland from producing excessive amounts of thyroid hormones (thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3)). It does this by inhibiting the enzyme thyroid peroxidase, which is crucial in the synthesis of these hormones.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?**  It can take several weeks to see a significant improvement in symptoms.  Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor thyroid hormone levels and adjust the dosage as needed.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking carbimazole?**  It's generally advised to limit alcohol consumption while on carbimazole, as it can interact with the medication and potentially increase the risk of side effects.  Consult your doctor.
* **Can I take other medications with carbimazole?**  Many medications can interact with carbimazole. It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Certain medications may increase the risk of side effects or reduce the effectiveness of carbimazole.
* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?**  Signs of an allergic reaction can include skin rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, and dizziness. If you experience any of these symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about missed doses.
* **Can I get pregnant while taking carbimazole?**  Carbimazole can cross the placenta and may harm the developing fetus. It's crucial to discuss pregnancy planning with your doctor before starting or continuing treatment.
