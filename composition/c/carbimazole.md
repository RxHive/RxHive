# Carbimazole
### Generic Name
Carbimazole

### Usage
Carbimazole is primarily used to treat hyperthyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland produces excessive thyroid hormones.  This leads to symptoms like rapid heartbeat, weight loss, nervousness, and heat intolerance.  It's used in adults and children, often as preparation for thyroidectomy (surgical removal of the thyroid) or radioactive iodine therapy.  It can also be used in conjunction with levothyroxine (a thyroid hormone replacement) in a "blocking and replacement" strategy to manage hyperthyroidism.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the patient's age, weight, and the severity of their hyperthyroidism.  It's crucial to follow the prescription provided by a healthcare professional precisely.  There is no single standard dose.

**Adults:**

* **Initial Dose (Hyperthyroidism):**  Typically starts at 20-60 mg per day, divided into 2-3 doses. The dose is carefully adjusted based on regular monitoring of thyroid function tests to achieve euthyroidism (a normal thyroid hormone level).

* **Maintenance Dose (Hyperthyroidism):** Once euthyroidism is achieved, the dose is usually reduced to 5-15 mg daily, often as a single dose. Treatment typically continues for at least 6 months, and sometimes up to 18 months.

* **Pre-operative/Radioactive Iodine Therapy:** Higher initial doses (20-60mg/day) may be used to quickly suppress thyroid hormone production before surgery or radioactive iodine treatment.  This is often combined with levothyroxine.

**Children (3-17 years):**

* The starting dose is usually lower, often 15 mg/day, and is carefully adjusted based on individual responses and close monitoring.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use with caution in mild to moderate liver impairment.  It's contraindicated in severe liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No specific dose adjustment is routinely recommended, but caution is advised. In end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on hemodialysis, administration should be after dialysis due to the medication's low protein binding.

**Administration:** Carbimazole is usually taken orally as a tablet.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Skin rash
* Itching (pruritus)
* Loss of hair
* Joint pain (arthralgia)


Less common, but more serious side effects, warrant immediate medical attention:

* Agranulocytosis (severely low white blood cell count)
* Aplastic anemia (bone marrow failure)
* Liver damage (hepatitis, jaundice)
* Allergic reactions (angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome)

If any side effects occur, especially those listed above, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Carbimazole is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, methimazole, in the body. Methimazole works by interfering with the production of thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) in the thyroid gland. It inhibits the steps involved in iodine uptake and hormone synthesis, leading to a reduction in thyroid hormone levels and control of hyperthyroidism.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Carbimazole should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to carbimazole, methimazole, or any of its components.

* **Hepatic/Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney problems (see Dosage Adjustments).

* **Hematological Conditions:** Contraindicated in patients with pre-existing severe blood disorders.

* **Pregnancy:** Carbimazole is a Category D drug in pregnancy. It can cross the placenta and has been linked to birth defects. Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the risks, and the lowest effective dose should be used.  Discontinuation 3-4 weeks before delivery may be recommended to minimize neonatal risks.

* **Breastfeeding:** Carbimazole is excreted in breast milk and breastfeeding is generally not recommended during treatment.

* **Interactions:**  Carbimazole can interact with other medications, such as anticoagulants (increasing bleeding risk) and theophylline (potentially increasing theophylline toxicity). Inform your doctor of all other medications being taken.


* **Alcohol:** Patients should avoid alcohol consumption during treatment.

* **Thyroid Crisis:**  Carbimazole should be temporarily stopped before radioactive iodine therapy to prevent a thyroid crisis.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Carbimazole with food?**  A: Yes, it can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How long will I need to take Carbimazole?** A: The duration of treatment varies, generally at least 6 months and sometimes up to 18 months or longer, depending on individual response and the need for ongoing management of hyperthyroidism.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Carbimazole?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light, as directed on the label.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Carbimazole?** A: Long-term use can rarely lead to hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), which would require thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Regular monitoring of thyroid function is essential.

* **Q: Can Carbimazole cause birth defects?** A: Yes, it can.  Discuss the risks and benefits carefully with your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
