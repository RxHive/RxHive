# Choline Salicylate
### Generic Name
Choline Salicylate

### Usage
Choline salicylate is primarily used topically to relieve pain, discomfort, and inflammation associated with various oral conditions.  Its main applications include treating mouth ulcers (canker sores), cold sores (fever blisters), and soreness caused by ill-fitting dentures or orthodontic appliances.  While not its primary use, it can provide temporary relief from the discomfort associated with these conditions.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For mouth ulcers, cold sores, and denture or orthodontic-related sores, apply approximately a half-inch ribbon of 8.7% choline salicylate gel (using a clean finger) directly to the affected area.  Do not apply more frequently than once every three hours. For denture irritation, apply the gel to the irritated areas of the mouth (not directly to the dentures) and leave it for at least 30 minutes before reinserting the dentures.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Choline salicylate gel is generally not recommended for children under 16 years of age.  For those 16 and older, the dosage is the same as for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before using this medication if you have any underlying liver or kidney conditions.


### Side Effects
*   Hypersensitivity (allergic reaction)

While rare, serious side effects are possible with any medication.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms after using choline salicylate.

### How it Works
Choline salicylate works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin synthesis, it helps to alleviate pain and inflammation in the affected area.  It also has a mild analgesic (pain-relieving) effect.

### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:**  Choline salicylate is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to salicylates (including aspirin and other NSAIDs), or any other component of the formulation.  It should not be used during the third trimester of pregnancy at doses exceeding 100 mg/day.  It is also contraindicated in children under 16 years of age.
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Salicylates (the active component of choline salicylate) are excreted in breast milk. While breastfeeding may be considered, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional to weigh the benefits and risks.  High doses of salicylates (over 100 mg/day) are contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.
*   **Drug Interactions:** While not extensively documented for topical choline salicylate, potential interactions exist with other medications.  Consult a healthcare professional about any other medications you are taking before using this product.
*   **Overdosage:**  In case of accidental ingestion of large amounts, supportive treatment for salicylate poisoning may be required. This might involve activated charcoal, urinary alkalinization, and in severe cases, hemodialysis.  Seek immediate medical attention if an overdose is suspected.
