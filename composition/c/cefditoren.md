# Cefditoren
### Generic Name
Cefditoren

### Usage

Cefditoren is an oral antibiotic belonging to the cephalosporin family.  It's primarily used to treat several bacterial infections, including:

* **Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis (ABECB):**  This refers to a worsening of chronic bronchitis symptoms caused by a bacterial infection. Cefditoren helps to clear the infection and alleviate the associated cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath.

* **Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP):** This is a lung infection acquired outside of a hospital setting. Cefditoren helps fight the bacterial infection causing the pneumonia.

* **Skin and Skin Structure Infections (SSSI):**  Cefditoren treats bacterial infections affecting the skin and underlying tissues, such as cellulitis or abscesses.

* **Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis:**  This medication is effective against bacterial infections causing inflammation of the throat (pharyngitis) and/or tonsils (tonsillitis).


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the infection being treated, the patient's age, and renal function.  Always follow your doctor's prescription instructions.  Generally, Cefditoren is available as an oral capsule or tablet.

**Adults:**

* **ABECB:** 400 mg twice daily (BID) for 10 days.
* **CAP:** 400 mg BID for 14 days.
* **Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis and uncomplicated SSSIs:** 200 mg BID for 10 days.


**Children:**

Cefditoren's use in children under 12 years old is not fully established.  Dosage for children 12 years and older generally follows the adult guidelines for ABECB and uncomplicated SSSIs.  For other indications in children (like CAP or Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis)  dosing may be different and is determined by the physician based on weight and clinical assessment. Specific pediatric dosage should always be determined and supervised by a doctor.  


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Kidney or liver problems may require dosage adjustments.  Consult your doctor for specific guidance if you have impaired renal or hepatic function.



### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:** These occur in more than 10% of patients:

* Diarrhea

**Less Common but Possible Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Vomiting
* Headache


**Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  While less frequent, these are important to be aware of:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis)
*  Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (a serious intestinal infection)
*  Increased risk of bleeding (especially in individuals on blood thinners)
*  Changes in blood counts
*  Kidney problems
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a rare but serious skin reaction)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Cefditoren is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  Bacteria need a strong cell wall to survive. By disrupting this process, Cefditoren prevents the bacteria from growing and reproducing, ultimately leading to their death and resolving the infection.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Cefditoren should not be used if you have a known allergy to cephalosporins or penicillins (there's a cross-reactivity possibility).  Inform your doctor about any prior antibiotic allergies.

* **Kidney/Liver Disease:**  Patients with kidney or liver problems may need dose adjustments.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Cefditoren's safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established. Consult your physician before using it during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.

* **Interactions:**  Cefditoren can interact with certain medications such as antacids, proton-pump inhibitors, and blood thinners (e.g., warfarin).  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Cefditoren with food?** A: Yes, it is generally recommended to take Cefditoren with food to minimize stomach upset.

* **Q: How should I store Cefditoren?** A: Store Cefditoren at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Never double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Cefditoren early if I feel better?** A: No, complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed, even if you feel better before finishing the medication. This helps ensure that the infection is completely eradicated and prevents the development of antibiotic resistance.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while on Cefditoren?**  A:  While there's no direct interaction listed, alcohol can sometimes worsen side effects like nausea and stomach upset. It's generally recommended to avoid excessive alcohol consumption while taking antibiotics.
