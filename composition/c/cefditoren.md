**Important Note:** Cefditoren pivoxil is a prescription medication and should only be used as directed by a doctor.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will depend on the type and severity of the infection, as well as the individual's overall health.  It's crucial to complete the entire course of antibiotics, even if symptoms improve, to prevent the recurrence of infection and the development of antibiotic resistance.

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives (less commonly, more severe allergic reactions like angioedema or anaphylaxis can occur).

* **Seizures:**  Especially in patients with a history of seizures or kidney problems.


This is not an exhaustive list of all possible side effects. Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning symptoms.


**How it Works:**

Cefditoren pivoxil is a beta-lactam antibiotic.  It works by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  This weakens the bacterial cell wall, causing the bacteria to die.  Specifically, it interferes with the transpeptidation reaction, a crucial step in peptidoglycan synthesis.  It is effective against a range of gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria.
