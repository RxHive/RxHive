# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Naphazoline + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Boric Acid

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Naphazoline + Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate + Boric Acid

**Usage:** This combination is typically found in over-the-counter ophthalmic solutions (eye drops) used to relieve the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis (allergic eye inflammation).  The specific symptoms it targets include:

* **Itching:** Chlorpheniramine maleate and naphazoline help alleviate itching.
* **Redness:** Naphazoline constricts blood vessels in the eye, reducing redness.
* **Swelling:**  While not directly addressing swelling, the reduction in inflammation contributes to less swelling.
* **Watery eyes:**  This combination helps reduce eye discharge and watery eyes associated with allergies.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Burning or stinging:** A common temporary sensation upon application.
* **Eye dryness:**  Prolonged use of naphazoline can lead to rebound congestion (worsening of symptoms after the effect wears off), potentially causing dryness.
* **Blurred vision:** Temporary blurring is possible.
* **Headache:**  Rarely reported.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Though uncommon, allergic reactions to any of the components can occur.  Stop use and consult a doctor immediately if you experience a severe reaction.

**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released during allergic reactions, reducing itching and watery eyes.
* **Naphazoline:** A sympathomimetic decongestant that constricts blood vessels in the eye, decreasing redness and swelling by reducing blood flow to the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye).
* **Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate:**  Has astringent properties, helping to reduce swelling and discharge.  Its exact mechanism in this combination is less clearly defined than the other ingredients.
* **Boric Acid:** Acts as a buffer and helps maintain the solution's pH, ensuring stability and comfort for the eyes.


**FAQs:**

* **How long can I use these eye drops?**  Don't use them for more than 7 days without consulting a doctor. Prolonged use of naphazoline can lead to rebound congestion.
* **Can I use these eye drops if I wear contact lenses?**  Generally, it's best to remove contact lenses before using these eye drops and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.  Always check the product label for specific instructions.
* **Are there any drug interactions?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible.
* **What should I do if I accidentally get the drops in my mouth?**  Rinse your mouth with water immediately.
* **What should I do if my symptoms worsen or don't improve after a few days?**  Consult a doctor or other healthcare professional.  This combination is for symptom relief, not a cure for allergic conjunctivitis.  They may need to investigate the underlying cause and recommend a different treatment.
