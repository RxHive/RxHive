# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate + Menthol
### Generic Name
Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate + Menthol


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections.  It targets several symptoms simultaneously:

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine that works to reduce runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes. It helps to dry up secretions by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction or infection.

* **Ammonium Chloride:** This acts as an expectorant, helping to loosen and thin mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up.

* **Sodium Citrate:**  This component helps to alkalinize the urine, potentially reducing irritation in the urinary tract (though this is not the primary reason for its inclusion in this combination). It can also act as a mild buffer.

* **Menthol:**  This provides a cooling sensation, offering some relief from nasal congestion and cough. It has a mild topical anesthetic effect that can soothe irritated mucous membranes.


This combination is generally used for symptomatic relief and does not treat the underlying cause of the infection (e.g., a virus).  It's most effective when used at the onset of symptoms.


### Dosage
