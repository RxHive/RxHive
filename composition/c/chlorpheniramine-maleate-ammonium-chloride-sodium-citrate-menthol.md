# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate + Menthol

**Usage:** This combination is typically found in over-the-counter cough and cold medications.  It's used to treat symptoms of the common cold or flu, including:

* **Cough:** Ammonium chloride is an expectorant, meaning it helps loosen mucus and make it easier to cough up.  Menthol provides a cooling sensation, potentially soothing irritated throat tissues.
* **Runny nose/Nasal Congestion:** Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that helps dry up runny noses.
* **Chest Congestion:** The combination of ammonium chloride and menthol works to loosen and clear mucus from the chest.  Sodium citrate helps to thin the mucus.

**Important Note:** This combination is symptomatic relief only and does not treat the underlying cause of the illness (e.g., viral infection).  It's crucial to consult a doctor if symptoms worsen or persist for more than a week.


**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** Chlorpheniramine maleate is a sedating antihistamine.
* **Dry mouth:** A common side effect of antihistamines.
* **Dizziness:** Can occur, especially with higher doses.
* **Headache:**  A relatively common side effect.
* **Nausea:** Less frequent but possible.
* **Constipation:**  Ammonium chloride can have this effect in some individuals.
* **Stomach upset:**  Can be caused by any of the components.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions, such as skin rashes, itching, or swelling, are possible.


**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This antihistamine blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction or infection. Histamine contributes to runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes. By blocking histamine, chlorpheniramine helps dry up these symptoms.

* **Ammonium Chloride:** This is an expectorant. It works by increasing the fluid content of respiratory tract mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel through coughing.

* **Sodium Citrate:** This acts as a buffer and helps to thin mucus, making it easier to cough up.

* **Menthol:** This provides a cooling sensation in the throat and airways, offering a soothing effect and potentially relieving some discomfort.
