# Chlorphenamine
### Generic Name
Chlorphenamine (Chlorpheniramine)

### Usage
Chlorphenamine is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergies.  This includes seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), perennial allergic rhinitis (year-round allergies), urticaria (hives), and pruritus (itching).  It's an antihistamine that works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  While not its primary indication, chlorphenamine is sometimes used off-label to treat motion sickness.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Allergic Symptoms (Oral):** Immediate-release tablets or capsules: 4 mg every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 24 mg per day. Extended-release tablets: 12 mg every 12 hours, not exceeding 24 mg per day.
* **Allergic Symptoms (Injectable - IM, IV, or Subcutaneous):**  The usual dose is 5-20 mg once or twice daily, but the maximum daily dose should not exceed 40 mg.
* **Motion Sickness (Oral):** 4-12 mg taken 3 hours before exposure to the motion stimulus.  Note:  Use with caution as drowsiness is a side effect and may be unsafe in certain circumstances.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  *Note:* The FDA does not recommend over-the-counter use of cough and cold products in children under 2 years of age due to the risk of serious side effects.  Always consult a healthcare provider before giving chlorphenamine to children.

Dosage for children varies greatly depending on age, weight, and the specific formulation (liquid, tablet).  Always follow the instructions on the medication label or consult a healthcare professional for accurate dosage.  Generally, lower doses are used for younger children, and the maximum daily dose is also lower.

### How it Works
Chlorphenamine is a first-generation antihistamine. It works by blocking the action of histamine at H1 receptors in the body. Histamine is a chemical released during allergic reactions, causing symptoms like sneezing, itching, runny nose, and watery eyes. By blocking histamine, chlorphenamine helps to alleviate these symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Chlorphenamine should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to the medication or its components, those with narrow-angle glaucoma, bladder neck obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, or those experiencing an acute asthma attack.  It is also contraindicated in premature and term newborns due to the association with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).  It should not be used to sedate children.
* **Drug Interactions:** Chlorphenamine can interact with other medications, including alcohol, sedatives, and other antihistamines. This can increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Chlorphenamine is classified as pregnancy category B, meaning studies in animals have not shown harm to the fetus, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  It's excreted in breast milk; use caution and monitor infants for drowsiness or irritability.
* **Specific Populations:**  Older adults, individuals with liver or kidney disease, and those with certain medical conditions (e.g., heart problems, hyperthyroidism) may require dosage adjustments or close monitoring.
