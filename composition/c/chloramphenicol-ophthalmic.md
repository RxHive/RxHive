# Chloramphenicol (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Chloramphenicol (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Chloramphenicol ophthalmic is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used primarily to treat superficial bacterial infections of the eye, most commonly bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye).  It's effective against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.  While primarily used for the eye, it's crucial to remember this is a topical formulation and should not be used to treat systemic bacterial infections.

### Dosage

**Superficial Ocular Infections (e.g., Bacterial Conjunctivitis):**

* **Adults and Children (including infants â‰¥1 month):**
    * **Ointment (1%):** Apply a small amount (approximately 1 cm) into the affected eye(s) every 3 hours, or more frequently if needed. Continue treatment for 48 hours after the eye(s) appear normal.
    * **Solution (0.5%):** Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) up to 6 times daily, or more frequently as needed. For severe infections, initial treatment may involve 1-2 drops every 15-20 minutes, gradually reducing frequency as the infection improves.
* **Infants (<1 month):**  The dosage is the same as for older children and adults; however, dosage adjustment may be necessary due to slower systemic elimination.  Maximum duration of treatment should be 10-14 days.

**Important Administration Instructions:**

* For ointment: Gently pull down the lower eyelid, look upward, and apply the ointment. Close your eye for a few seconds.
* For solution: Tilt your head back, pull down the lower eyelid, and instill the drops. Blink a few times. If the drop misses the eye, instill another drop.
* Avoid touching the tip of the applicator to the eye or any other surface. Wash your hands before and after application.
* Contact lenses should be removed before application and not reinserted until after the prescribed treatment period.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Burning, stinging, or temporary blurry vision. Eye irritation, redness, and itching are also possible.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis), decreased blood pressure, and changes in blood cell counts (e.g., anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, or, rarely, aplastic anemia).  These are far more likely with systemic use of chloramphenicol but can occur with topical use as well, though less frequently.
* **If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, including those not listed here, contact your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.**


### How it Works

Chloramphenicol is a bacteriostatic antibiotic. This means it prevents bacteria from multiplying rather than directly killing them. It achieves this by binding to bacterial ribosomes, the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis.  By inhibiting protein synthesis, chloramphenicol effectively stops the bacteria from growing and reproducing, allowing the body's immune system to clear the infection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Chloramphenicol is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or a history of blood dyscrasias (disorders of blood cells), particularly aplastic anemia.  It should also be avoided in those who have previously experienced myelosuppression (suppression of bone marrow function) from chloramphenicol use.
* **Interactions:** Chloramphenicol may interact with other medications, especially those that also affect bone marrow function.  Inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Systemic absorption of chloramphenicol is possible, even with topical application.  Because of the potential risks to the fetus and infant, use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be avoided unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  A doctor should carefully weigh this decision.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with kidney or liver disease due to the potential for impaired drug metabolism and excretion.
* **Long-term Use:** Prolonged use of chloramphenicol, even topically, can increase the risk of developing serious side effects.  Regular blood tests to monitor blood cell counts may be necessary with prolonged or intermittent use.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long should I use chloramphenicol ophthalmic?**  A: Continue treatment as directed by your doctor, typically for 48 hours after symptoms have cleared.  Do not stop treatment prematurely.
* **Q: Can I use chloramphenicol ophthalmic with other eye drops?** A:  It's best to consult your doctor or pharmacist to determine appropriate timing for use with other eye drops.  Allow several minutes between applications to avoid interactions or dilution.
* **Q: How should I store chloramphenicol ophthalmic?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is chloramphenicol ophthalmic safe for children?** A:  It can be used in children, but under the close supervision of a doctor.  Dosage adjustments might be necessary for infants under one month of age.
