# Crotamiton
### Generic Name
Crotamiton

### Usage
Crotamiton is primarily used to treat scabies, a skin infestation caused by the *Sarcoptes scabiei* mite.  It effectively eradicates these mites.  Secondly, it's used for the symptomatic relief of itchy skin (pruritus), though it's not a first-line treatment for this condition.  It addresses the itching associated with various skin problems, but doesn't treat the underlying cause.

### Dosage

**Scabies:**

* **Adults and Children (including infants):** For scabies, Crotamiton (10% lotion or cream) is applied as a thin layer to the entire body from the neck down, paying close attention to skin folds, creases, and areas between fingers and toes.  This application should be repeated after 24 hours. A cleansing bath or shower is recommended 48 hours after the final application. Treatment might be repeated if new lesions appear or itching persists beyond 2-4 weeks post-treatment.  Note that other medications are often preferred as first-line treatment for scabies due to their greater efficacy.


**Pruritus:**

* **Adults and Children:** For pruritus (itching), apply a thin layer of the 10% lotion or cream to the affected areas and gently massage until fully absorbed. Repeat applications as needed, but follow the recommendations of your healthcare provider.


**Important Considerations:**  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's specific instructions regarding dosage and application frequency.  The information provided here is for general understanding and should not replace professional medical advice.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Localized warm feeling
* Contact dermatitis
* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin rash
* Local irritation
* Local hypersensitivity reactions

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects are possible.  If you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects, immediately consult your healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Crotamiton's mechanism of action against scabies isn't fully understood, but it effectively kills the *Sarcoptes scabiei* mites. Its anti-itching (antipruritic) effect is believed to result from the inhibition of histamine, serotonin, and PAR-2, substances involved in the itch sensation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Crotamiton should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to crotamiton or any of its components.  It's also contraindicated in those who have a history of significant irritation from topical medications.
* **Drug Interactions:** Currently, no significant interactions with other medications are reported. However, it's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements) you are taking to avoid potential conflicts.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Crotamiton falls under pregnancy category C, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are not fully established.  Its use during pregnancy should only be considered when the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.  The excretion of Crotamiton in breast milk is unknown. Discuss the use of Crotamiton with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Children:**  While Crotamiton can be used in children, always adhere to the recommended pediatric dosage and carefully monitor for any adverse effects.
* **Other:**  Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.  Do not apply to broken, raw, or severely inflamed skin. Discontinue use immediately if severe irritation or allergic reaction occurs.  Thoroughly wash and dry the skin before applying the medication.  Wash contaminated clothing and bedding.
