# Casimersen
### Generic Name
Casimersen

### Usage
Casimersen is an antisense oligonucleotide medication used to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients with a confirmed mutation in the *DMD* gene that allows for exon 45 skipping.  The drug's approval is based on observed increases in dystrophin production in skeletal muscle.  Dystrophin is a protein crucial for muscle function, and its deficiency causes DMD.  Casimersen works by targeting a specific part of the genetic code to facilitate the production of a partially functional dystrophin protein.  It's important to note that Casimersen is not a cure for DMD, but it aims to improve muscle function and slow disease progression.

### Dosage
The recommended dose for both adults and children with DMD is 30 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) once weekly.  The medication is given as an infusion, typically over 35-60 minutes, after dilution and filtration.  There are no specific dosage adjustments recommended for hepatic or renal impairment, however, close monitoring is crucial in patients with kidney issues.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Pain (particularly post-traumatic)
*   Cough
*   Oropharyngeal pain
*   Upper respiratory tract infection
*   Nausea
*   Arthralgia (joint pain)
*   Ear pain (otalgia)
*   Middle ear infection (otitis media)
*   Fever

While less common, serious side effects, such as kidney toxicity, are possible.  Regular monitoring of kidney function is therefore essential. Any concerning side effects should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Casimersen functions as an antisense oligonucleotide.  It binds to a specific section of the pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) for the dystrophin geneâ€”exon 45. This binding leads to the exclusion of exon 45 during the process of creating mature messenger RNA (mRNA), a process called exon skipping. Exon 45 skipping produces a shortened, but partially functional, dystrophin protein.  This partially functional protein can help improve muscle function to some extent.  The effectiveness depends on the specific mutation in the *DMD* gene.


### Precautions
While no specific contraindications are listed, close monitoring is crucial, particularly of kidney function (renal function tests, including proteinuria), in all patients receiving casimersen. Patients should report any signs of kidney problems to their healthcare provider immediately.  The safety of casimersen during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  The decision to breastfeed while using casimersen should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, weighing the potential risk to the infant against the benefits of breastfeeding and treatment for the mother.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How is Casimersen administered?** A: It's given intravenously (IV) as a weekly infusion, typically lasting 35-60 minutes.
*   **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Administer the missed dose as soon as possible.
*   **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A: No significant interactions are currently known, but it's always essential to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
*   **Q: How is kidney function monitored?** A: Regular urine tests for protein and blood tests to assess kidney function are typically conducted.
*   **Q: Is Casimersen a cure for DMD?** A: No, it is not a cure, but it aims to improve muscle function and slow disease progression.
*   **Q: Who should not use Casimersen?** A: Currently, there are no identified contraindications, but patients with pre-existing kidney problems need close monitoring.
*   **Q: How is Casimersen stored?** A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with the medication.  Generally, proper refrigeration and protection from light are needed.
