# charcoal

Generic Name:  Charcoal (activated charcoal)

Usage:  Activated charcoal is used to treat or prevent poisoning from certain substances ingested by mouth.  It's also sometimes used to treat gas, bloating, and diarrhea, though its effectiveness for these conditions is less well-established and more research is needed.  It's important to note that activated charcoal is NOT used for all types of poisoning and is ineffective for some substances (e.g., strong acids/alkalis, iron, cyanide).  Always consult medical professionals for poisoning cases.

Side Effects:  Side effects can include constipation, black stools (this is normal), and vomiting.  In rare cases, more serious side effects may occur, such as bowel obstruction (especially in individuals with pre-existing conditions affecting the bowel).  Aspiration of charcoal can lead to serious lung problems if the charcoal is inhaled.  It can also interact with certain medications, reducing their effectiveness.

How it Works: Activated charcoal works by binding to toxins and other substances in the digestive tract, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream.  This bound substance is then eliminated from the body through the stool.  It is a physical process, not a chemical reaction, meaning it doesn't alter the toxins themselves but rather prevents their entry into the bodyâ€™s systemic circulation.

FAQs:

* **Q: Can I take activated charcoal without a doctor's advice?** A:  For poisoning, absolutely seek immediate medical attention.  For gas or diarrhea, while it's available over-the-counter, it's best to consult a doctor or pharmacist first to ensure it's appropriate for you and won't interact with any other medications you're taking.

* **Q: How quickly does activated charcoal work?** A: For poisoning, it needs to be administered quickly.  For gastrointestinal issues, the effects may be slower and vary depending on the individual.

* **Q: Is it safe to take activated charcoal every day?** A: No, it's not recommended for daily use. Long-term use can lead to nutrient deficiencies and other health problems.

* **Q:  What should I do if I accidentally take too much activated charcoal?** A: Contact a medical professional or poison control immediately.

* **Q:  Will activated charcoal whiten my teeth?** A:  While some anecdotal evidence suggests this, there's no strong scientific evidence to support its use for teeth whitening.  It may cause staining of teeth.
