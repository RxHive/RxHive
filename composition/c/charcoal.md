### Generic Name
Activated Charcoal

### Usage
Activated charcoal is a medication primarily used to treat poisonings and overdoses.  Its porous structure allows it to bind to various toxins and poisons in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream. This makes it a crucial first-line treatment in many emergency situations, particularly when someone has ingested potentially harmful substances.  While its primary use is in emergency settings, it's also sometimes used to treat certain types of gas and bloating related to digestive issues.  It's important to note that activated charcoal is *not* effective against all poisons (e.g., strong acids or alkalis, iron, lithium) and should only be administered under the direct supervision of a medical professional in cases of poisoning.

### Dosage
Dosage of activated charcoal varies greatly depending on the type and severity of the poisoning, the patient's weight, and the specific recommendations of the treating physician.  There's no standardized dosage for general digestive issues, and its use in this context should be discussed with a doctor.  In emergency situations, activated charcoal is typically administered orally as a slurry (mixed with water or another liquid) or via nasogastric tube (a tube inserted through the nose and into the stomach). Intravenous administration is not possible.  Dosage for poisoning is usually calculated based on body weight, often ranging from 0.5 to 1 gram per kilogram of body weight.  Children's dosages must be calculated and administered by a healthcare professional.  Never attempt to self-administer activated charcoal for poisoning or any other condition.

### Side Effects
* **Constipation:**  A very common side effect, often requiring additional measures to alleviate.
* **Black stools:** Harmless discoloration of feces due to the charcoal's color.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Can occur, especially with high doses.
* **Dehydration:** Due to potential vomiting and diarrhea.
* **Aspiration pneumonia:** A rare but serious complication if the charcoal is inhaled into the lungs.
* **Electrolyte imbalance:** Possible with high doses, especially in individuals with existing electrolyte problems.

**Note:**  Serious side effects are rare but possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unexpected or severe side effects after taking activated charcoal.


### How it Works
Activated charcoal works by a process called adsorption.  Its highly porous structure creates a vast surface area that attracts and binds various molecules, including toxins and gases, to its surface.  This binding action prevents these substances from being absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract.  The bound toxins are then eliminated from the body through the stool.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Activated charcoal should not be given to individuals who have ingested strong acids or alkalis, or certain other specific substances, as it may worsen the situation.  It should also be avoided in patients with esophageal or intestinal obstruction.
* **Drug Interactions:** Activated charcoal can bind to and reduce the absorption of other medications if taken concurrently.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking before using activated charcoal.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered under strict medical supervision, particularly in emergency situations.
* **Children:** Dosage for children must always be determined by a healthcare professional.  Never administer charcoal to a child without medical advice.
* **Aspiration:**  Care should be taken to prevent aspiration (inhalation) of activated charcoal.
