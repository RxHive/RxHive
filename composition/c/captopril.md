# Captopril

**Generic Name:** Captopril

**Usage:**

Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor primarily used to treat:

* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  It helps relax blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood.
* **Heart failure:** It improves the heart's ability to pump blood and reduces symptoms.
* **Diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease related to diabetes):** It slows the progression of kidney damage in some patients.
* **After a heart attack:** It may reduce the risk of death and heart failure in some patients after a heart attack.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects (affecting more than 1 in 100 people):

* **Dry cough:** This is a very common side effect and is often a reason people switch to another ACE inhibitor or a different type of blood pressure medication.
* **Dizziness or lightheadedness:** Especially when starting treatment or increasing the dose.
* **Headache:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Diarrhea:**
* **Taste disturbances:**  A metallic taste in the mouth is reported by some patients.

Less common but serious side effects (requiring immediate medical attention):

* **Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat):** This is a rare but potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. Stop taking captopril immediately and seek emergency medical help if this occurs.
* **High potassium levels (hyperkalemia):**  Especially in patients with kidney problems or those taking other medications that can raise potassium levels.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** Can cause dizziness and fainting.
* **Changes in kidney function:**  Especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Skin rashes:**


**How it Works:**

Captopril works by blocking the action of an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).  ACE converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor (meaning it narrows blood vessels).  By inhibiting ACE, captopril reduces the amount of angiotensin II, leading to:

* **Vasodilation (widening of blood vessels):** This lowers blood pressure.
* **Reduced fluid retention:** This reduces the workload on the heart.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking captopril?**  While small amounts are generally okay, excessive alcohol consumption can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of side effects.  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.
* **Can I take captopril with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible.  Some medications can increase the risk of side effects, such as potassium-sparing diuretics.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **When should I contact my doctor?** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects, such as angioedema, severe dizziness, or significant changes in kidney function.  Regular monitoring of blood pressure and kidney function is often recommended.
* **Can I stop taking captopril suddenly?**  No, you should never stop taking captopril suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a sudden increase in blood pressure, potentially causing serious complications.  Your doctor will need to gradually reduce your dose.
