# Captopril
### Generic Name
Captopril

### Usage
Captopril is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It's also prescribed for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (the heart's ability to pump blood is weakened), left ventricular dysfunction following a heart attack (myocardial infarction), and diabetic nephropathy (kidney damage caused by diabetes).  In some cases, it may be used off-label for conditions like Raynaud's phenomenon (reduced blood flow to the fingers and toes) and as a diagnostic tool for primary aldosteronism (a hormonal disorder).

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the individual's response.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  Generally:

* **Hypertension:** Starts at 12.5-25 mg twice or three times daily, increasing gradually as needed. The maximum dose is usually 50 mg three times daily.
* **Heart Failure:** Begins with a low dose (6.25 mg three times daily), gradually increasing to a target of 50 mg three times daily.
* **Post-Myocardial Infarction:**  Initial dose is typically 6.25 mg, increasing gradually over several weeks to a target dose of 50 mg three times daily.  The timing of initiation post-heart attack is critical and should be determined by a physician.
* **Diabetic Nephropathy:** Usually starts at 25 mg three times daily.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Captopril is used in children for heart failure and hypertension, but the dosage is determined by weight and the child's overall health, calculated in mg/kg/dose.  Always consult a pediatrician for precise dosing.  Maximum dose is 6 mg/kg/day.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Kidney function significantly impacts captopril dosing.  People with reduced kidney function require lower doses and more careful monitoring.  Liver function doesn't typically require dosage adjustments.

**Administration:** Captopril is usually taken orally as a tablet. It should generally be taken at least one hour before meals.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (frequency not precisely defined):**

* Dry, persistent cough

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat; this is a medical emergency)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)
* Renal impairment (kidney problems)
* Changes in blood cell counts (neutropenia, agranulocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia)
* Liver problems (hepatitis, jaundice)

If you experience any side effects, particularly the serious ones, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE is an enzyme that plays a role in regulating blood pressure.  By inhibiting ACE, captopril prevents the formation of angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor (substance that narrows blood vessels).  Lowering angiotensin II leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing blood pressure and strain on the heart.  It also reduces aldosterone levels, further contributing to blood pressure control and fluid balance.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Captopril is a Category D drug during pregnancy, meaning it poses a risk to the developing fetus.  It should be avoided during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters.  If pregnancy occurs during treatment, discontinue the medication immediately and consult your doctor.
* **Breastfeeding:** Captopril passes into breast milk, so consult your physician about the risks and benefits of breastfeeding while using this medication.
* **Kidney Disease:** People with kidney disease require careful monitoring and adjusted dosages.
* **Other Medications:** Captopril can interact with numerous medications. Inform your doctor about all the medications, supplements, and herbs you take to avoid potentially harmful interactions.  This includes NSAIDs, potassium supplements, and potassium-sparing diuretics.
* **Surgery:** Your doctor may advise you to stop taking captopril before or after major surgery.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  If you have ever had an allergic reaction to an ACE inhibitor, you shouldn't take captopril.
* **Underlying Conditions:** Individuals with conditions like aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or renal artery stenosis should use captopril with caution.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Captopril?** A:  Alcohol can worsen the side effects of Captopril, especially low blood pressure. Moderate or avoid alcohol consumption.
* **Q: How should I store Captopril?** A: Store Captopril in a cool, dry place, away from moisture and direct sunlight, as directed on the label.
