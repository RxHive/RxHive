# Cetrorelix
### Generic Name
Cetrorelix

### Usage
Cetrorelix is primarily used in assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures, specifically in women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or other ART techniques.  Its main function is to prevent premature ovulation by suppressing the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge.  This ensures that the eggs are allowed to mature fully before retrieval.  It is not used to treat any specific disease but rather as an adjunct to other fertility medications.

### Dosage
Cetrorelix is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  Dosage varies depending on the treatment protocol employed by the fertility clinic.  There are two common regimens:

* **Single-dose regimen:** A single 3mg dose is typically administered when serum estradiol levels indicate an appropriate ovarian response, usually around day 7 of stimulation (range: days 5-9). If human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) isn't given within 4 days, a daily dose of 0.25 mg is continued until hCG administration.

* **Multiple-dose regimen:**  A daily dose of 0.25 mg is started on the morning or evening of stimulation day 5 or the morning of stimulation day 6 and continued until hCG is administered.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of Cetrorelix in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  However, Cetrorelix is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) â€“ a serious complication requiring close medical monitoring
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%, reported post-marketing):**

* Anaphylaxis (including cough, hypotension, and skin rash)
* Injection site reactions (bruising, redness, itching, swelling)


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Cetrorelix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist.  GnRH is a hormone that triggers the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland.  LH is crucial for ovulation. Cetrorelix works by binding to the GnRH receptors on pituitary cells, blocking the action of GnRH and preventing the premature LH surge that would otherwise cause premature ovulation. This allows for controlled follicle development and optimized egg retrieval in ART procedures.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to Cetrorelix, GnRH, GnRH analogs, mannitol, or any component of the formulation.
* Severe renal impairment.
* Pregnancy.
* Breastfeeding.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including severe anaphylactic reactions.
* Use with caution in patients with active allergic conditions or a history of allergic predisposition.
*  Close monitoring for OHSS is essential, especially in patients at high risk.
* Avoid concomitant use with indium 111 capromab pendetide.
