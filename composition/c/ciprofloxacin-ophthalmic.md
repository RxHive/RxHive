# Ciprofloxacin (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Ciprofloxacin (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution and ointment are used to treat bacterial infections of the eye, primarily bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and corneal ulcers.  Bacterial conjunctivitis is a common infection of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye). Corneal ulcers are more serious infections affecting the cornea, the clear front part of the eye. Ciprofloxacin targets a wide range of bacteria responsible for these infections.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Bacterial Conjunctivitis:**
    * **Solution (0.3%):**  Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 2 hours while awake for the first 2 days, then 1-2 drops every 4 hours while awake for the next 5 days.
    * **Ointment (0.3%):** Apply a ½-inch ribbon into the affected eye(s) three times daily (TID) for the first 2 days, then twice daily (BID) for the next 5 days.

* **Corneal Ulcers:**
    * **Solution (0.3%):**  The dosage is more frequent and intense for corneal ulcers. Initially, instill 2 drops every 15 minutes for the first 6 hours, then every 30 minutes for the rest of the first day. On day 2, instill 2 drops every hour. From day 3 to 14, instill 2 drops every 4 hours. Treatment may continue beyond 14 days if the corneal ulcer hasn't healed.
    * **Ointment (0.3%):** (Generally off-label for corneal ulcers) Apply a ½-inch ribbon every 1-2 hours around the clock for the first 2 days, then every 4 hours for up to 12 days.  Treatment may be extended if healing is not complete.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children varies depending on age and the specific condition.  Always follow a doctor's instructions carefully.  Generally, the dosage is similar to adults for conjunctivitis but may be less frequent for younger children.  For corneal ulcers in children, the dosage schedule is more intensive, similar to adults, but always under the strict supervision of an ophthalmologist.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for liver or kidney problems because the systemic absorption of ophthalmic ciprofloxacin is low.  However, a doctor might make adjustments in specific situations.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Burning, stinging, or irritation in the eye;  discomfort; redness; itching; a gritty feeling.  Crystalline deposits may sometimes be visible in the eye in cases of corneal ulcers.  A temporary unpleasant taste may occur immediately after instillation.

* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis); blurred vision; vision changes; corneal damage (e.g., corneal infiltrates, staining); eye pain; eyelid swelling;  superinfections (new infections due to overgrowth of other bacteria or fungi).

**Note:**  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor or healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It works by inhibiting an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which is essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair.  By blocking this enzyme, ciprofloxacin prevents bacterial cells from reproducing and eventually leads to their death. This targeted action makes it effective against a wide range of bacteria that cause eye infections.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Do not use ciprofloxacin if you are allergic to ciprofloxacin, other quinolone antibiotics, or any ingredient in the formulation.

* **Interactions:** Although ophthalmic ciprofloxacin has low systemic absorption,  it's important to inform your doctor about all medications you are using, including other eye drops or ointments.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ciprofloxacin is classified as category C during pregnancy, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are unknown.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  It's unclear whether ciprofloxacin passes into breast milk.  Use caution if breastfeeding.

* **Children:**  Use in children should be as per a doctor's prescription.

* **Other Precautions:** Avoid touching the tip of the container to your eye or any surface.  For solution, apply gentle pressure to the tear duct after instillation to minimize systemic absorption.  Remove contact lenses before applying the medication.  Do not use if the solution is discolored or cloudy.  Do not use after the expiration date.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Ciprofloxacin to work?** A: Improvement should be seen within a few days, but complete resolution of the infection might take a full course of treatment.

* **Q: Can I stop using Ciprofloxacin once I feel better?** A: No, complete the full course of treatment prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better.  Stopping early can lead to recurrence of the infection and antibiotic resistance.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Ciprofloxacin?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I use Ciprofloxacin ophthalmic for ear infections?** A: No, Ciprofloxacin ophthalmic is only for use in the eyes. Use only as directed by your doctor.  If you have an ear infection, consult a doctor for appropriate treatment.
