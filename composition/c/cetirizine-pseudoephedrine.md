# Cetirizine + Pseudoephedrine
### Generic Name
Cetirizine + Pseudoephedrine

### Usage

Cetirizine + Pseudoephedrine is a combination medication used to relieve symptoms of seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in adults and children 12 years and older.  It combines the effects of cetirizine, an antihistamine that blocks histamine's action in the body, and pseudoephedrine, a decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages.  This dual action targets both the itchy, watery eyes and runny nose associated with allergies, as well as nasal congestion.  The medication is intended for symptomatic relief and doesn't address the underlying cause of allergies.


### Dosage

**Adults (12 years and older):** The usual dose is one tablet (containing Cetirizine 5mg and Pseudoephedrine 120mg) twice daily.  The maximum daily dose is two tablets.

**Children (Under 12 years):**  This combination medication is not recommended for children under 12 years of age, as safety and efficacy haven't been established in this age group.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with liver or kidney problems.  For those with mild to severe liver impairment or a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 11 to 31 mL/minute, the dose may be reduced to one tablet once daily. Consult a healthcare professional for specific guidance based on individual health conditions.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

*   Drowsiness
*   Insomnia
*   Fatigue
*   Dizziness
*   Dry mouth
*   Sore throat
*   Nosebleeds (epistaxis)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects may include:  rapid heart rate, increased blood pressure, nervousness, anxiety and difficulty urinating.  If you experience any serious or unusual side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Cetirizine, the antihistamine component, works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. Histamine causes symptoms like itching, sneezing, and runny nose. By blocking histamine, cetirizine reduces these symptoms.

Pseudoephedrine, the decongestant, works by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages. This reduces swelling and congestion, making it easier to breathe.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to cetirizine, pseudoephedrine, or any component of the formulation. It should also be avoided within two weeks of discontinuing MAO inhibitor therapy.  Other contraindications include narrow-angle glaucoma, severe coronary artery disease, severe hypertension, and urinary retention.

**Interactions:**  Cetirizine + Pseudoephedrine may interact with various medications, including MAO inhibitors, beta-blockers, and other drugs affecting the central nervous system or blood pressure.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking.

**Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, liver or kidney problems, diabetes, increased intraocular pressure, thyroid dysfunction, prostatic hyperplasia, or those who are elderly, pregnant, or breastfeeding.  Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants while taking this medication.  Driving or operating machinery should be approached cautiously due to potential drowsiness.
