# Cetirizine + Pseudoephedrine

**Generic Name:** Cetirizine and Pseudoephedrine

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and other upper respiratory allergies.  Cetirizine is an antihistamine that reduces allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and itchy throat. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.  It's important to note that this combination is available over-the-counter in some formulations, but others require a prescription depending on the dosage and specific ingredients.  Always follow the dosage instructions on the label or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Cetirizine-related:** drowsiness, headache, dry mouth, fatigue, nausea.  Less common but more serious effects include dizziness, stomach pain.
* **Pseudoephedrine-related:** nervousness, dizziness, difficulty sleeping, headache, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, nausea.

More serious side effects are less common but should be reported to a doctor immediately. These can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Fast or irregular heartbeat
* Chest pain
* Severe headache
* High blood pressure
* Difficulty urinating


**How it Works:**

* **Cetirizine:** Works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This helps to reduce allergy symptoms.
* **Pseudoephedrine:**  Narrows blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.  This makes it easier to breathe.
