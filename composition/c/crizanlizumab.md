# Crizanlizumab
### Generic Name
Crizanlizumab

### Usage

Crizanlizumab is a medication primarily used to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in adult and adolescent patients (16 years and older) with sickle cell disease.  VOCs are painful episodes caused by the sickling of red blood cells, blocking blood flow.  This medicine works by targeting a specific protein involved in this process, thus helping to prevent these painful and potentially serious crises. Crizanlizumab is not a cure for sickle cell disease, but it aims to improve the patient's quality of life by reducing the number of VOCs experienced.  It's important to note that the effectiveness of Crizanlizumab may vary between individuals.


### Dosage

**Adults and Adolescents (≥16 years):** Crizanlizumab is administered intravenously (IV). The recommended dosage for reducing the frequency of VOCs in sickle cell disease is as follows:

*   An initial dose of 5 mg/kg is given once every 2 weeks for two doses (at week 0 and week 2).
*   Following the initial doses, 5 mg/kg is administered once every 4 weeks.
*   Crizanlizumab can be given with or without hydroxyurea, another medication commonly used to manage sickle cell disease.

**Pediatric Patients (<16 years):**  The safety and effectiveness of Crizanlizumab have not been established in children under 16 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  If you have concerns about kidney or liver function, it’s crucial to discuss them with your healthcare provider before starting Crizanlizumab.  For severe infusion-related reactions, the medication should be discontinued, and appropriate management should be initiated as needed.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in >10% of patients):**

*   Nausea
*   Arthralgia (joint pain)
*   Back pain
*   Fever

**Less Common Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

*   Abdominal pain/distress
*   Diarrhea
*   Vomiting
*   Itching (pruritus)
*   Vulvovaginal itching
*   Infusion-site pain or reaction
*   Injection-site swelling or extravasation (leakage)
*   Musculoskeletal chest pain
*   Myalgia (muscle pain)
*   Oropharyngeal pain (pain in the mouth and throat)
*   Antibody development
*   Infusion-related reactions

**Rare Side Effects:** Abnormal platelet aggregation (this is not fully characterized in terms of frequency)

**Serious Side Effects:** While less frequent, severe infusion-related reactions can occur.  It's crucial to report any concerning side effects to your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Crizanlizumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by binding to P-selectin, a protein found on the surface of blood vessel cells.  In sickle cell disease, P-selectin contributes to the adhesion of sickle red blood cells to blood vessel walls, leading to blockages and VOCs. By binding to P-selectin, Crizanlizumab prevents this interaction, helping to maintain blood flow and reduce the frequency of VOCs.  This mechanism helps to decrease platelet aggregation and improve blood flow.


### Precautions

*   **Pregnancy:** Crizanlizumab has the potential to harm a developing fetus. It should only be used during pregnancy if the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.
*   **Breastfeeding:** It's unknown whether Crizanlizumab is excreted in breast milk.  The risks and benefits of breastfeeding should be carefully considered while taking Crizanlizumab.
*   **Infusion-Related Reactions:**  Patients should be monitored closely for infusion reactions during and after administration.  Severe reactions necessitate immediate discontinuation of the drug and appropriate medical management.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  While no specific drug interactions are extensively listed, it's vital to inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are currently taking (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements) to assess potential interactions.
*   **Automated Platelet Counts:** Crizanlizumab may interfere with automated platelet counts, particularly when using EDTA tubes.  Citrate tubes should be used, and blood samples processed promptly.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take for Crizanlizumab to work?** A: The effects of Crizanlizumab on reducing the frequency of VOCs may not be immediately apparent. It takes time for the medication to reach therapeutic levels and exert its effects.  Improvements will generally be seen over time with consistent treatment.
*   **Q: Can I stop taking Crizanlizumab if I feel better?** A: No, do not stop taking Crizanlizumab without consulting your healthcare provider.  Consistent treatment is essential to maintain the benefits of reduced VOC frequency.
*   **Q: How is Crizanlizumab stored?** A: Storage instructions will be provided by your pharmacy. Generally, this medication needs to be stored as per manufacturer's instructions, usually under refrigeration, and used within a specific timeframe once prepared.
*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, contact your doctor or healthcare provider as soon as possible to determine the best course of action.  Generally, if the missed dose is within 2 weeks, the schedule can be resumed. Beyond that, a revised schedule may be necessary.
*   **Q: Are there any specific diet restrictions while taking Crizanlizumab?** A: There are no specific dietary restrictions associated with Crizanlizumab.  Maintain a healthy and balanced diet, as recommended by your healthcare provider.
