# Calcipotriol
### Generic Name
Calcipotriol

### Usage
Calcipotriol is a topical medication primarily used to treat psoriasis.  It's a synthetic vitamin D analog that works by slowing down the rapid growth of skin cells characteristic of psoriasis. This helps reduce the scaling, redness, and inflammation associated with the condition.  While its primary use is for plaque psoriasis, it may sometimes be used in combination with other treatments for other forms of psoriasis, though this is generally decided on a case-by-case basis by a dermatologist.  It's important to note that calcipotriol is only for external use on the skin and should never be ingested.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (ointment, cream, solution) and the severity of the psoriasis.  A doctor will provide personalized instructions. Generally, a thin film of calcipotriol is applied to affected areas once or twice daily, as directed.  

* **Adults:** The typical dose involves applying a small amount to cover the affected area, usually not exceeding 75g per week.  Excessive application should be avoided.
* **Children:**  Use in children is generally not recommended unless specifically prescribed by a dermatologist due to a lack of extensive research in pediatric populations. If prescribed, the dosage will be carefully adjusted based on the child's age, weight, and the severity of the psoriasis.
* **Oral and IV Administration:** Calcipotriol is only for topical application and should never be taken orally or administered intravenously.

Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely regarding the amount to apply and the frequency of application.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of calcipotriol are usually mild and may include:

* Skin irritation (burning, stinging, redness)
* Dry skin
* Itching
* Rash

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Increased calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia) â€“ This is rare but requires immediate medical attention.
* Allergic reactions (such as hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).


If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, stop using calcipotriol and consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Calcipotriol is a synthetic analog of vitamin D3.  It works by binding to vitamin D receptors in skin cells. This interaction slows down the rapid growth and division of skin cells that is a hallmark of psoriasis.  By slowing this process, calcipotriol helps reduce the thickening of the skin, scaling, redness, and inflammation characteristic of the condition.


### Precautions
* **Hypercalcemia:**  People with a history of high blood calcium levels should use calcipotriol with extreme caution, under close medical supervision. Regular blood calcium monitoring may be necessary.
* **Kidney Disease:** Calcipotriol should be used with caution in individuals with kidney disease.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of calcipotriol during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a doctor. While generally considered low risk, the potential benefits need to be carefully weighed against any potential risks to the mother and child.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, you are currently using.  Some medications may interact with calcipotriol.
* **Sun Exposure:** While not a direct contraindication, it's wise to limit excessive sun exposure while using calcipotriol, as this could potentially increase the risk of skin irritation.
* **Large Surface Area Application:** Avoid applying calcipotriol to large areas of the body to minimize the risk of hypercalcemia.
