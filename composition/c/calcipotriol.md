# Calcipotriol

**Generic Name:** Calcipotriene

**Usage:**

Calcipotriene is a topical treatment used to reduce the inflammation and scaling associated with plaque psoriasis.  It is typically applied once or twice daily to affected areas of skin. The specific dosage and frequency will be determined by a doctor based on the severity of the psoriasis.  It's important to note that it's not a cure for psoriasis, but rather a treatment to manage symptoms.  It's often used in combination with other treatments, such as corticosteroids.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects are generally mild and can include:

* **Skin irritation:**  Burning, stinging, itching, redness, dryness, and peeling at the application site.  These are usually temporary and subside with continued use or reduction in application frequency.
* **Facial flushing:** Redness of the face.
* **Contact dermatitis:** Allergic skin reaction at the application site.


Less common but more serious side effects are rare but should be reported to a doctor immediately:

* **Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels):** This is more likely with extensive application or use of high doses, especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney problems.  Symptoms might include fatigue, constipation, increased thirst, and frequent urination.
* **Acneiform rash:** A rash resembling acne.


**How it Works:**

Calcipotriene is a vitamin D analogue. It works by slowing down the rapid growth of skin cells that is characteristic of psoriasis.  This helps reduce the thickness and scaling of psoriatic plaques.  It also has anti-inflammatory properties which help reduce redness and inflammation.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I use calcipotriene on my face?**  It's generally not recommended for facial use unless specifically prescribed by a doctor due to the risk of irritation and increased sensitivity of facial skin.

* **Can I use calcipotriene during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  It's crucial to discuss this with your doctor before using calcipotriene during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  The risks and benefits need to be carefully evaluated.

* **How long does it take to work?**  You may start to see improvement in your psoriasis symptoms within a few weeks of starting treatment, but consistent use is vital for long-term control.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't apply a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Can I use calcipotriene with other topical treatments?**  Always consult your doctor before using calcipotriene with other topical medications, especially corticosteroids.  Combining treatments may increase the risk of side effects.

* **What should I do if I experience severe side effects?**  Stop using calcipotriene and contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects.
