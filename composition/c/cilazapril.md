# Cilazapril
### Generic Name
Cilazapril

### Usage

Cilazapril is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and as an adjunct therapy in the management of heart failure.  Its primary mechanism is to lower blood pressure, which helps reduce the workload on the heart in heart failure and prevents damage to blood vessels in hypertension.  While its main use focuses on these two conditions,  it's important to note that the specific application and dosage will be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and health status.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and individual patient factors.  A healthcare professional will tailor the dosage to the specific situation.

* **Heart Failure:**  Treatment typically begins with a low dose (0.5 mg once daily) and is carefully increased (to a maximum of 2.5 mg once daily) over several days based on the patient's response and tolerance.

* **Hypertension:**  The usual starting dose is higher (2.5-5 mg once daily), but can be adjusted (up to a maximum of 10 mg daily, potentially split into two doses) according to the patient's response.

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with reduced kidney function (creatinine clearance).  Lower starting doses are recommended, and the maximum dose may also be lower. In severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min), cilazapril is generally not recommended.

* **Hepatic Impairment:** In patients with liver disease (particularly cirrhosis without ascites), a reduced starting dose is recommended, and close monitoring is crucial.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of cilazapril in children have not been established. It should not be used in children.


The medication is usually administered orally as a tablet, following the physician's specific instructions.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing)
* Nausea
* Weakness
* Increased serum creatinine level (indication of kidney function changes)
* Cough


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
*  Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
*  Severe hypotension (dangerously low blood pressure)
*  Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)
*  Neutropenia/agranulocytosis (low white blood cell counts)
*  Renal failure
*  Cholestatic jaundice


If any adverse effects occur, it's vital to consult a doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Cilazapril is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, cilazaprilat, in the body. Cilazaprilat inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is an enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor (a substance that narrows blood vessels). By blocking ACE, cilazaprilat reduces angiotensin II levels. This leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing blood pressure and easing the strain on the heart.  The decreased angiotensin II also leads to decreased aldosterone secretion, further contributing to blood pressure reduction and fluid balance regulation.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Cilazapril is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to cilazapril or other ACE inhibitors, a history of angioedema related to ACE inhibitor use, hereditary or idiopathic angioedema, ascites, anuria (absence of urine production), concomitant use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes or moderate-to-severe renal impairment, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and concomitant use with neprilysin inhibitors (e.g., sacubitril).  Also, it shouldn't be used in patients with certain hereditary galactose or glucose metabolism disorders.

* **Interactions:**  Cilazapril can interact with numerous medications, including diuretics, potassium supplements, other antihypertensive drugs, NSAIDs, and lithium.  Consult a doctor about all medications and supplements being taken.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Cilazapril is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Effective contraception should be used by women of childbearing potential while on this medication.

* **Other Precautions:**  Close monitoring of blood pressure, kidney function, and electrolytes is essential, particularly in patients with existing kidney or liver problems, heart disease, or those undergoing major surgery.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take cilazapril with food?** A: Cilazapril can usually be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store cilazapril?** A: Store cilazapril in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as directed on the label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking cilazapril suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping cilazapril abruptly can lead to a rebound effect, causing a sudden increase in blood pressure.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Q: Is cilazapril safe for everyone?** A: Cilazapril, like all medications, carries risks.  Certain individuals, including those with kidney or liver disease, should be carefully monitored while taking this drug. Your doctor will determine if it's appropriate for your specific health condition.
