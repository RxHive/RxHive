# Carboxymethylcellulose + Glycerin
### Generic Name
Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium + Glycerin

**Note:**  Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and glycerin are often used together, but they aren't a single "medicine" in the traditional sense.  They are pharmaceutical excipients â€“ inactive ingredients that serve a purpose in drug formulation.  This information describes their common uses and properties when combined.  They are not taken alone as medications.

### Usage

Carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na) and glycerin are frequently combined in various pharmaceutical formulations, primarily as:

* **Binders and Thickening Agents:** In tablets and capsules, CMC-Na acts as a binder, holding the active ingredients together. Glycerin adds to the binding effect and also contributes to the tablet's cohesiveness and disintegration properties.
* **Suspending Agents:** In liquid medications (suspensions), CMC-Na helps keep solid particles suspended evenly, preventing settling. Glycerin enhances this effect and contributes to the stability and viscosity of the suspension.
* **Lubricants:**  In some formulations, CMC-Na and glycerin can act as lubricants during tablet compression, aiding in the smooth ejection of tablets from the manufacturing machinery.
* **Moisturizers:** Glycerin, in particular, is a humectant (meaning it attracts and retains moisture). This property makes it useful in topical preparations (creams, ointments) to keep the skin hydrated.  When combined with CMC-Na, this moisturizing effect may be enhanced.


They are not used to treat a specific disease but are components enhancing the delivery and properties of medications containing active pharmaceutical ingredients.


### Dosage

There is no dosage for CMC-Na and glycerin as standalone medications. The amount used varies significantly depending on the specific pharmaceutical formulation and the desired properties. This information is determined and controlled by the manufacturer of the drug product containing them.  


### Side Effects

Because CMC-Na and glycerin are generally considered inert and well-tolerated, significant side effects are rare when used as excipients in pharmaceutical products. However, in extremely rare cases and depending on the specific formulation:

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Some individuals might experience allergic reactions, such as skin irritation or rash, if they have a hypersensitivity to either substance.
* **Gastrointestinal Upset:** In high concentrations, CMC-Na can occasionally cause mild gastrointestinal discomfort, such as bloating or diarrhea, though this is unusual in standard drug formulations.


If any adverse reactions occur, stop using the medication and consult a healthcare professional.


### How it Works

CMC-Na is a cellulose derivative that forms a viscous solution in water. This viscosity is what allows it to act as a binder, suspending agent, or lubricant.  Glycerin, a simple polyol, acts as a humectant, attracting and retaining water, and also enhances the viscosity and plasticity of the formulations. They work together to improve the physical properties and stability of the final drug product.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:** Individuals with known allergies to cellulose derivatives or glycerin should avoid products containing them.
* **Drug Interactions:**  CMC-Na and glycerin are generally considered to have minimal interactions with other drugs, but always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of CMC-Na and glycerin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally considered to be well-established at the levels used in pharmaceutical formulations. However, always consult with a healthcare professional.
* **Specific Formulations:**  Precautions may vary depending on the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the specific formulation of the medication containing CMC-Na and glycerin. Always follow the instructions on the medication label.


### FAQs

* **Q: Are CMC-Na and glycerin safe?**  A: Yes, generally, CMC-Na and glycerin are considered safe when used as excipients in pharmaceutical formulations at recommended levels.

* **Q: Can I use CMC-Na and glycerin by themselves?** A: No, they are not intended for use as standalone medications.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop using the medication and consult a healthcare professional immediately.

* **Q: How are these ingredients stored?** A:  The storage instructions will depend on the specific formulation; follow the guidance provided on the medication's label.  Generally, these ingredients are stable under normal storage conditions.
