# Cefpodoxime Proxetil + Ofloxacin

**Generic Name:** Cefpodoxime Proxetil + Ofloxacin

**Usage:** This combination is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections in various parts of the body.  The specific infections it's used for vary depending on the country and prescribing physician.  Common uses may include:

* **Respiratory tract infections:**  Bronchitis, pneumonia (depending on severity and causative organism)
* **Ear infections (otitis media):**  Middle ear infections
* **Skin and skin structure infections:**  Cellulitis, abscesses (depending on severity and causative organism)
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):**  Cystitis, pyelonephritis (depending on severity and causative organism)

**Important Note:** This combination is not effective against all bacterial infections.  The doctor will determine if this combination is appropriate based on the specific infection and the bacteria causing it.  **It's crucial to always follow the doctor's prescription and not use this medication for self-treatment.**

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Cefpodoxime Proxetil + Ofloxacin can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, indigestion
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives, swelling (angioedema), difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis - a medical emergency)
* **Central nervous system:** Headache, dizziness
* **Other:** Vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis), changes in taste

**Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention.  These may include:**

**How it Works:**

Cefpodoxime Proxetil is a cephalosporin antibiotic. It works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, leading to bacterial cell death.  Ofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It works by inhibiting an enzyme (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair, thus preventing bacterial growth and ultimately causing bacterial death. The combination provides broader coverage against a wider range of bacteria than either drug alone.
