# Chlorhexidine Gluconate

**Generic Name:** Chlorhexidine Gluconate

**Usage:**

Chlorhexidine gluconate is a broad-spectrum antiseptic used topically to reduce the number of bacteria, fungi, and some viruses on the skin and mucous membranes.  Its uses are varied and include:

* **Pre-operative skin disinfection:** To prepare the skin before surgery to reduce the risk of infection.
* **Oral hygiene:** In mouthwashes and gels to treat gingivitis, periodontitis, and other oral infections. It's also used as an antiseptic after oral surgery.
* **Wound cleansing:**  To clean minor wounds and abrasions to prevent infection.
* **Hand hygiene:** In some healthcare settings, it may be used as a surgical hand scrub or for hand disinfection.
* **Catheter care:** To help prevent urinary tract infections associated with catheters.


**Side Effects:**

Generally, chlorhexidine gluconate is well-tolerated, but side effects can occur, particularly with prolonged or frequent use:

* **Skin irritation:**  This is the most common side effect, ranging from mild redness and dryness to more severe allergic reactions in some individuals.
* **Allergic reactions:**  These can manifest as skin rash, itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if severe allergic reactions occur.
* **Staining:** Chlorhexidine can stain teeth, tongue, and skin a brown or yellow color.  This staining is usually temporary in the mouth but can be more persistent on skin and in some fabrics.
* **Taste alteration:** Some people experience a temporary alteration in their taste perception.
* **Burning or stinging sensation:** This is common, particularly when applied to irritated or broken skin.


**How it Works:**

Chlorhexidine gluconate works by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane, leading to cell death. It's also believed to interfere with bacterial enzyme systems and precipitate bacterial proteins.  This broad-spectrum activity allows it to be effective against a wide range of microorganisms.  The exact mechanism varies slightly depending on the specific microorganism.
