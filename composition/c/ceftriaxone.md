# Ceftriaxone
### Generic Name
Ceftriaxone

### Usage

Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic.  Its primary use is in treating various bacterial infections.  This includes serious infections like bloodstream infections, meningitis (infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord), and bone and joint infections (osteomyelitis and septic arthritis). It's also effective against less severe infections such as pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and uncomplicated gonorrhea.  The specific bacteria Ceftriaxone targets depend on the infection and should be considered when choosing treatment. Note that Ceftriaxone is sometimes used off-label for other conditions; however, always follow a doctor's recommendations.

### Dosage

Ceftriaxone dosage varies greatly depending on the type and severity of infection, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (intravenous [IV] or intramuscular [IM]).  It's crucial to follow a doctor's precise instructions.  

**Adult Dosage (examples, not exhaustive):** Dosages range from 1 gram to 2 grams daily, sometimes given once daily or divided into twice-daily doses.  Treatment duration usually lasts from several days to several weeks, depending on the condition. For example, meningitis may require treatment for 7-21 days, while osteomyelitis might require 6 weeks or longer.  Intravenous administration is usually preferred for severe infections.

**Pediatric Dosage (examples, not exhaustive):** Pediatric dosing is usually calculated based on weight (mg/kg/day).  Dosages can range from 50-100 mg/kg/day, divided into one or two doses, depending on the severity of the infection.  Again, the duration of treatment is determined by the doctor. 


**Administration:**  Ceftriaxone is administered intravenously (IV) by slow infusion or intramuscularly (IM) injection.  For IV administration, the injection should typically be given over at least 30 minutes (an hour for neonates).  Specific instructions will be provided by the healthcare professional.  IM injections must be given deeply into a large muscle mass.

**Important Note:** The information above provides general examples.  The specific dosage and administration instructions must be determined and provided by a healthcare professional based on the individual patientâ€™s needs and the type of infection being treated.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 1% of patients) can include:

* Diarrhea
* Skin rash
* Pain, swelling, or redness at the injection site
* Increased liver enzymes (detected through blood tests)


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis)
* Seizures
* 
* *Clostridioides difficile* infection (a serious bowel infection)
* Kidney problems
* Blood abnormalities (e.g., low blood cell counts)


If you experience any side effects, especially severe or unusual ones, contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Ceftriaxone is a bactericidal antibiotic, meaning it kills bacteria. It achieves this by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a vital component of bacterial cell walls.  By disrupting this process, Ceftriaxone weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to bacterial cell death.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Ceftriaxone should not be used in individuals with known allergies to cephalosporins or any of its components. Those with penicillin allergies should be closely monitored as cross-reactivity is possible, though less common than with other beta-lactams.
* **Drug Interactions:** Ceftriaxone may interact with certain medications, including some anticoagulants (blood thinners) and aminoglycoside antibiotics.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Neonates:**  Ceftriaxone should be used cautiously in newborns, particularly premature infants, due to the potential risk of hyperbilirubinemia (high levels of bilirubin in the blood) and incompatibility with calcium-containing intravenous solutions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ceftriaxone is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but should only be used when the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  It's excreted in breast milk, so caution is needed during breastfeeding.
* **Kidney and Liver Disease:** Patients with kidney or liver problems might require dosage adjustments.

### FAQs

* **Can Ceftriaxone treat viral infections?** No, Ceftriaxone is only effective against bacterial infections.
* **How should I store Ceftriaxone?** Store Ceftriaxone as directed on the label, usually at room temperature and protected from light and moisture.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance; do not double up on doses.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Ceftriaxone?** While there's no direct interaction listed, excessive alcohol intake may worsen the side effects or compromise your health while combating an infection. Consult your doctor.
* **Is Ceftriaxone available over-the-counter?** No, Ceftriaxone is a prescription-only medication.
