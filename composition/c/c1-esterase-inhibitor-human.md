# C1 Esterase Inhibitor, Human
### Generic Name
C1 Esterase Inhibitor, Human

### Usage
C1 esterase inhibitor (human) is primarily used for routine prophylaxis (prevention) of angioedema attacks in adults, adolescents, and children (6 years and older) with hereditary angioedema (HAE). HAE is a rare genetic disorder causing swelling (angioedema) in various body parts, potentially life-threatening if affecting the airways.  This medication is also used to treat acute HAE attacks affecting the abdomen, face, or larynx (voice box).  While primarily indicated for HAE,  off-label uses may include pre-procedural prophylaxis before certain medical procedures to reduce the risk of angioedema.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Different formulations of C1 esterase inhibitor (human) are not interchangeable. Always follow the specific instructions provided with your medication.  Dosage varies significantly based on the route of administration (IV or subcutaneous [SubQ]), patient age, weight, and whether it's for prophylaxis or acute treatment.  Consult the prescribing information for the specific product you are using. The information below is a summary and may not be entirely comprehensive.

**Adults:**

* **Long-term prophylaxis (IV):** Typically 1000 units every 3-4 days.  Higher doses (up to 2500 units, ≤100 units/kg) may be used if needed, based on individual response.
* **Long-term prophylaxis (SubQ):**  Usually 60 units/kg every 3-4 days; off-label regimens may use 40 or 60 units/kg twice weekly.
* **Short-term/pre-procedural prophylaxis (IV):** Approximately 20 units/kg or 1000 units administered as close as possible to the procedure start.
* **Treatment of acute attacks (IV):** 20 units/kg.


**Pediatric Patients (6 years and older):**

* **Routine prophylaxis (IV):**  Children aged 6-11 years usually start with 500 units every 3-4 days;  children 12 and older typically receive 1000 units every 3-4 days. Doses can be increased if necessary, up to a maximum of 2500 units or ≤100 units/kg.
* **Routine prophylaxis (SubQ):** 60 units/kg every 3-4 days.
* **Treatment of acute attacks (IV):**  20 units/kg; a repeat dose may be given after one hour if needed.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Skin rash
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Injection-site reaction
* Nausea, dysgeusia (altered taste), vomiting
* Pruritus (itching)
* Fever

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (including urticaria [hives], chest tightness, wheezing, hypotension, anaphylaxis)
* Thromboembolic events (blood clots in arteries or veins)
* Antibody development

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

C1 esterase inhibitor (human) is a protein that regulates the body's complement and contact systems, which are involved in inflammation.  In people with HAE, these systems are overactive, leading to the excessive production of bradykinin—a substance causing increased vascular permeability and swelling (angioedema). C1 esterase inhibitor works by inhibiting these overactive systems and reducing bradykinin production, thus preventing or treating HAE attacks.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with life-threatening hypersensitivity to C1 esterase inhibitor (human) or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients may have an increased risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions, thromboembolic events, and transmission of infectious agents.
* **Interactions:**  Androgens, estrogen derivatives, and progestins may increase the risk of thromboembolic events when used with C1 esterase inhibitor.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  C1 esterase inhibitor is the preferred treatment for HAE during pregnancy.  However, it's categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the risks to the fetus are unknown. The effects of breastfeeding are not known. Discuss these concerns with your doctor.
* **Other Precautions:**  Close monitoring for hypersensitivity reactions and thrombotic events is crucial.  The medication is derived from human plasma, so there's a theoretical risk of transmitting infectious agents.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is C1 esterase inhibitor stored?** A:  Storage instructions vary depending on the specific product formulation. Always refer to the product label and package insert for precise storage guidelines.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration and the indication (prophylaxis versus treatment).  For acute attacks, improvement is typically seen relatively quickly after IV administration.
* **Q: Can I take other medications with C1 esterase inhibitor?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs.  Some interactions are possible, as described above.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of prophylaxis?** A: Contact your healthcare provider for guidance; do not double the dose.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A: Long-term use is generally well-tolerated, but regular monitoring is necessary to assess for adverse effects and adjust the dosage as needed.
