# Cefmetazole
### Generic Name
Cefmetazole

### Usage
Cefmetazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the cephalosporin family.  Its primary use is in treating infections caused by susceptible bacteria, notably those responsible for gonorrhea (caused by *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*). It's also effective against a range of anaerobic and mixed bacterial infections, making it useful in treating various infections where multiple bacterial types are involved.  While it has a broad spectrum, it's crucial to note that its effectiveness varies depending on the specific bacteria involved; susceptibility testing is often performed to ensure the antibiotic is appropriate for a given infection.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Gonorrhea and other infections:** The dosage varies depending on the severity of the infection. For mild to moderate infections, the typical dose is 0.5-1 gram every 12 hours, administered either intravenously (IV) slowly over 3-5 minutes or intramuscularly (IM).  Severe infections may require higher dosesâ€”3-4 grams daily divided into doses given every 6-8 hours. IV administration for severe infections can be given as an infusion over 10-60 minutes.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and efficacy of cefmetazole in children have not been established.  Therefore, it is not recommended for use in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with renal impairment. The specific adjustments depend on the creatinine clearance (CrCl) rate:

* CrCl > 90 mL/min: Standard dosing
* CrCl 50-90 mL/min: 1-2 g every 12 hours
* CrCl 30-49 mL/min: 1-2 g every 16 hours
* CrCl 10-29 mL/min: 1-2 g every 24 hours
* CrCl < 10 mL/min: 1-2 g every 48 hours

The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) impairment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Pain at the injection site (IM administration)
* Thrombophlebitis (IV infusion)
* Gastrointestinal (GI) effects (e.g., nausea, diarrhea)

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage)
* Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis (decreased white blood cell counts)
* Bleeding complications
* CNS toxicity (effects on the nervous system)
* Superinfection (new infections due to the disruption of normal bacterial flora)
* Hepatitis
* Cholestatic jaundice (liver condition)
* Pseudomembranous colitis (severe inflammation of the colon)


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, it's crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Cefmetazole is a bactericidal antibiotic. This means it kills bacteria rather than simply inhibiting their growth. It achieves this by interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis.  Specifically, it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), crucial enzymes involved in building the bacterial cell wall. By inhibiting these proteins, cefmetazole prevents the bacteria from forming a functional cell wall, leading to their death.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cefmetazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to cephalosporin antibiotics.  A history of penicillin allergy also necessitates caution, as cross-reactivity can occur.

* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (particularly colitis), renal impairment, porphyria, or those concurrently consuming alcohol.  Alcohol consumption while taking cefmetazole can lead to a disulfiram-like reaction (similar to Antabuse).


* **Drug Interactions:**  Cefmetazole can interact with several other medications.  Probenecid can increase cefmetazole serum levels. Vitamin K antagonists (blood thinners) may have their effects enhanced by cefmetazole.  Careful monitoring is necessary when using cefmetazole concurrently with these or other medications.


* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Cefmetazole is categorized as pregnancy category B, indicating that animal reproduction studies haven't shown any risk to the fetus, but adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women are lacking.  The excretion of cefmetazole into breast milk is unknown; caution should be exercised when administering it to breastfeeding women.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store cefmetazole?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided on the product label. Typically, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.


* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking cefmetazole?** A: No.  Alcohol consumption can cause a disulfiram-like reaction, leading to unpleasant side effects. Avoid alcohol entirely while on cefmetazole.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.


* **Q: Can cefmetazole treat viral infections?** A: No. Cefmetazole is an antibacterial agent; it's ineffective against viral infections.


* **Q: How long will I need to take cefmetazole?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the type and severity of the infection. Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment length.  It's crucial to complete the entire course of antibiotics, even if you feel better before finishing.


* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects, such as severe allergic reactions, difficulty breathing, or significant gastrointestinal problems.
