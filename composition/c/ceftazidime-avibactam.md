# Ceftazidime + Avibactam
### Generic Name
Ceftazidime/Avibactam

### Usage
Ceftazidime/Avibactam is a combination antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections.  Its primary uses are for complicated intra-abdominal infections (infections within the abdomen), hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia (lung infections acquired in the hospital setting), and complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), including pyelonephritis (kidney infection).  This combination is particularly useful because it combats bacteria that have developed resistance to other antibiotics.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Dosage information provided below is for general understanding and should not be considered medical advice.  Always follow the prescription and instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  The dosage is usually expressed as the total amount of the Ceftazidime/Avibactam combination.

**Adults:** The typical intravenous (IV) dose is 2.5 grams every 8 hours.  The duration of treatment varies depending on the infection, usually ranging from 5 to 14 days.  Specific dosages may be adjusted based on kidney function (see Dosage Adjustments below).

**Children:** Pediatric dosing is usually based on the weight of the child and the specific infection.  Generally, it involves administering Ceftazidime at a dose of 40-50 mg/kg every 8 hours intravenously. Maximum daily doses are usually capped, so it's crucial to consult the prescribing information or a healthcare professional for precise dosage recommendations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with kidney impairment (reduced kidney function). The dosage is lowered and/or the frequency of administration is decreased to avoid accumulating drug levels that could cause harm.  Patients on hemodialysis require specific dosage adjustments, usually given after the dialysis session.  Hepatic (liver) impairment does not typically require dosage adjustments.

**Administration:** This medication is administered intravenously (IV) by infusion, usually over a period of 2 hours.  Never self-administer this medication.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Injection site pain or inflammation (phlebitis)
* Skin rash
* Itching (pruritus)
* Positive direct Coombs test (a blood test result)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Acute kidney failure
* <i>Clostridioides difficile</i>-associated diarrhea (a serious intestinal infection)
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Seizures
* Liver damage (increased liver enzymes)
* Blood disorders (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocythemia)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Ceftazidime is a cephalosporin antibiotic that works by interfering with the bacteria's ability to build their cell walls.  This leads to bacterial cell death and resolves the infection.  Avibactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor, which means it prevents certain enzymes produced by bacteria from breaking down Ceftazidime.  By protecting Ceftazidime from degradation, Avibactam expands the range of bacteria this antibiotic can effectively treat, including those that are resistant to other antibiotics.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Ceftazidime/Avibactam is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity to Ceftazidime, Avibactam, other cephalosporins, or any component of the formulation.  Use with caution in patients with penicillin or other beta-lactam allergies.
* **Kidney Function:**  Individuals with impaired kidney function require dosage adjustments to avoid toxic build-up.
* **Drug Interactions:** Several medications can interact with Ceftazidime/Avibactam, potentially reducing effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  These include aminoglycosides, probenecid, and certain vaccines. Itâ€™s crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Ceftazidime/Avibactam is categorized as pregnancy category B. This means studies in animals have not shown risk, but human studies are lacking.  Use during pregnancy should be considered only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  It is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should use caution.
* **Superinfections:**  The use of antibiotics can sometimes lead to an overgrowth of other organisms, such as fungi or other resistant bacteria.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of effects varies depending on the severity of the infection and the individual's response, but improvement should be seen within a few days.

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other drugs?** A:  It's essential to inform your physician about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible.

* **Q: How should I store Ceftazidime/Avibactam?** A: Store as directed by the pharmacist, usually in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance; do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Is Ceftazidime/Avibactam safe for everyone?** A: It is generally safe when prescribed and administered properly, but precautions exist for people with certain medical conditions or allergies.  Always consult your physician before starting any medication.
