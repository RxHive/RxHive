# Ceftazidime + Avibactam

**Generic Name:** Ceftazidime-avibactam

**Usage:** Ceftazidime-avibactam is a combination antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections in adults.  These infections must be complicated and caused by specific bacteria that produce beta-lactamases, enzymes that can break down certain antibiotics like ceftazidime. It's typically reserved for cases where other antibiotics have failed or are unlikely to be effective.  Specific infections treated include:

* Complicated intra-abdominal infections (infections of the abdomen)
* Complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs)
* Hospital-acquired pneumonia (pneumonia acquired in a hospital setting)
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (pneumonia acquired while on a ventilator)


**Side Effects:** Like all medications, ceftazidime-avibactam can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity. Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Rash
* Injection site reactions (if administered intravenously)
* Increased liver enzymes (seen in blood tests)


More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (a severe form of diarrhea)
* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to life-threatening anaphylaxis)
* Seizures
* Liver inflammation (hepatitis)
* Kidney problems


**How it Works:** Ceftazidime-avibactam is a combination of two drugs:

* **Ceftazidime:** A cephalosporin antibiotic that works by interfering with the bacteria's ability to build cell walls.  This weakens the bacteria and ultimately leads to their death.
* **Avibactam:** A beta-lactamase inhibitor. This means it prevents certain enzymes (beta-lactamases) produced by bacteria from breaking down ceftazidime. This allows the ceftazidime to effectively kill the bacteria, even those that are usually resistant to it.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Ceftazidime-avibactam a broad-spectrum antibiotic?** While broader than ceftazidime alone, it's not a broad-spectrum antibiotic in the sense that it covers all bacteria. It's effective against certain Gram-negative bacteria that produce specific beta-lactamases.  Your doctor will determine if it's appropriate for your infection based on lab results.

* **Can I take Ceftazidime-avibactam orally?** No, ceftazidime-avibactam is administered intravenously (IV) only.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any severe or concerning side effects.  Some side effects may require immediate medical attention.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Ceftazidime-avibactam?**  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication, as it can potentially worsen side effects, particularly nausea and vomiting. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific advice.

* **Can I stop taking Ceftazidime-avibactam early if I feel better?** No, it's crucial to complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better. Stopping early can lead to the infection returning and potentially becoming resistant to the antibiotic.
