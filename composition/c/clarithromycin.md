**How it Works:** Clarithromycin works by preventing bacteria from producing essential proteins.  This stops the bacteria from growing and multiplying, allowing the body's immune system to fight off the infection.  It achieves this by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, interfering with protein synthesis.
