# Clarithromycin
### Generic Name
Clarithromycin

### Usage

Clarithromycin is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections.  Its primary use is in treating infections caused by susceptible bacteria, covering a wide range of conditions.  These include:

* **Respiratory tract infections:** Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, acute maxillary sinusitis (sinus infection), and community-acquired pneumonia.  It's also sometimes used for pharyngitis/tonsillitis (strep throat, but usually not the first-line treatment).
* **Skin and skin-structure infections:** Uncomplicated infections of the skin and surrounding tissues.
* **Helicobacter pylori infection:** A bacterium that causes stomach ulcers and gastritis.  Clarithromycin is often part of a combination therapy regimen to eradicate *H. pylori*.
* **Disseminated Mycobacterial Infections:**  Clarithromycin is crucial in treating certain mycobacterial infections, particularly *Mycobacterium avium* complex (MAC) disease, especially in individuals with compromised immune systems (like those with HIV/AIDS). This can involve both treatment of active disease and preventative (prophylactic) measures.  It also sees off-label use in other mycobacterial infections like *Mycobacterium abscessus*.
* **Other Infections:** Clarithromycin has off-label uses for treating a range of other bacterial infections, including Bartonellosis (e.g., bacillary angiomatosis), Lyme disease, pertussis (whooping cough), and even some cases of group A streptococcal pharyngitis (though penicillin is usually preferred).  These uses should always be under the direct guidance of a physician.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the infection being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the form of the medication (oral or intravenous).  Always follow the prescription exactly.  The information below is for general understanding only and shouldn't replace consultation with a healthcare professional.

**Adults:**  Dosages range from 250mg to 1000mg daily, given either twice daily or once daily depending on the formulation (immediate-release or extended-release tablets).  Intravenous formulations are also available, typically at 500mg every 12 hours. Specific dosages for various conditions are quite extensive and should be obtained from a prescribing physician or consulted in a reputable medical reference.

**Children:**  Pediatric dosages are typically calculated based on weight, often 15mg/kg/day divided into two doses.  Maximum daily doses are usually capped, and specific guidelines vary significantly by infection. Again, precise pediatric dosing must come from a doctor's prescription.


**Administration:** Oral tablets should be taken with or without food (unless specified as "with food" for extended-release), while intravenous formulations are infused over a specific period.  Granules for oral suspension should be shaken well before each dose.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Insomnia
* Skin rash
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Altered taste (dysgeusia)
* Abnormal liver function test results


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
*  QT prolongation (a heart rhythm abnormality) and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias (torsades de pointes)
*  Serious liver problems (hepatitis, jaundice, hepatic failure)
*  Pseudomembranous colitis (a severe bowel inflammation)
* Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (severe skin reactions)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Clarithromycin is a bacteriostatic antibiotic (meaning it stops bacteria from multiplying) that works by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacterial cells. This prevents protein synthesis, a crucial process for bacterial survival and replication.  A significant metabolite of clarithromycin, the 14-OH metabolite, also demonstrates antibacterial activity, enhancing its effectiveness against some bacteria.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Clarithromycin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to macrolide antibiotics (including erythromycin) or any component of the medication.
* **Liver disease:** Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; dosage adjustments might be necessary.
* **Kidney disease:** Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; dosage adjustments might be necessary.
* **Cardiac Issues:** Clarithromycin can prolong the QT interval, increasing the risk of potentially fatal arrhythmias. It's especially important to avoid this in patients with pre-existing heart conditions, electrolyte imbalances, or those taking other QT-prolonging medications.
* **Drug interactions:** Clarithromycin interacts with many other drugs, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Clarithromycin is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been definitively established.  It should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so caution is warranted during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Can I take Clarithromycin with food?**  Generally, yes, but always check the specific instructions on your prescription label as some formulations are better absorbed when taken with food, while others don't require it.
* **How should I store Clarithromycin?** Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Clarithromycin?**  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking Clarithromycin, as it can increase the risk of certain side effects. Discuss with your doctor if you have concerns.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Never double up on doses.
* **How long will it take to feel better?** This varies depending on the infection and the individual.  You may start to feel better within a few days, but it's crucial to complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed by your physician even if symptoms improve.  Stopping early can lead to treatment failure and the development of antibiotic resistance.  Contact your doctor if your condition does not improve within a reasonable time.
