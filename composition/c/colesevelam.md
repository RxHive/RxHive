# Colesevelam

**Generic Name:** Colesevelam hydrochloride

**Usage:**

Colesevelam is used to lower cholesterol levels in adults with primary hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) or mixed dyslipidemia (high cholesterol and other abnormal lipid levels). It's often used in combination with diet and exercise, and sometimes with other cholesterol-lowering medications (statins, for example).  It's specifically indicated for patients who cannot tolerate or are not responding adequately to statin therapy.  It may also be used to treat type 2 diabetes in conjunction with other treatments to improve glycemic control.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Constipation:** This is a very frequent side effect.
* **Abdominal pain or discomfort:**  Often related to the constipation.
* **Gas:** Flatulence.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Diarrhea:** Although less common than constipation.

Less common but more serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention.  These can include:

* **Severe constipation:** Leading to bowel obstruction.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.

**How it Works:**

Colesevelam is a bile acid sequestrant.  It works in the intestines by binding to bile acids, preventing their reabsorption into the bloodstream.  Because the liver uses cholesterol to make bile acids, the removal of bile acids from the body forces the liver to use more cholesterol to replace them, thereby lowering LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels in the blood.  It can also slightly raise HDL ("good") cholesterol. The effect on triglycerides (another type of fat in the blood) is less pronounced.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take colesevelam with other medications?** A:  Colesevelam can interact with other medications, particularly those that are absorbed in the intestines.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking before starting colesevelam.  It can reduce the absorption of some drugs, making them less effective.  Your doctor may need to adjust dosages accordingly.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience constipation?** A:  Increase your fluid and fiber intake.  If constipation persists or worsens, consult your doctor.  Do not self-treat with over-the-counter laxatives without consulting a doctor first.

* **Q: Is colesevelam safe for everyone?** A: Colesevelam is generally considered safe, but it's not suitable for everyone.  People with certain conditions, such as bowel obstructions or severe constipation, should not take it. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the use of colesevelam with their doctor.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  It may take several weeks to see a significant reduction in cholesterol levels.  Regular blood tests will monitor your progress.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
