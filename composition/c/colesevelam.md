# Colesevelam
### Generic Name
Colesevelam

### Usage

Colesevelam is a medication primarily used to lower high levels of LDL ("bad") cholesterol in adults.  It's specifically used in cases of primary hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol with no other known cause) and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (a genetic condition causing high cholesterol) in adolescents (males and females who have started menstruating, aged 10-17) who haven't reached their cholesterol goals despite diet and lifestyle changes.  Additionally, colesevelam helps improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes, again in conjunction with diet and exercise.  It's important to note that colesevelam is an *adjunct* therapy, meaning it works best when combined with lifestyle modifications.  It's not a standalone treatment.


### Dosage

**Adults:**  For both high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, the typical starting dose is 3.75 grams per day, taken in one or two divided doses. This should be taken with meals. The specific dosage might be adjusted based on individual response and the doctor's assessment.

**Children and Adolescents (10-17 years):** For heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the usual dose is 3.75 grams daily, either all at once or split into two doses.  Due to the large size of the tablets, the oral suspension or chewable bar formulation is usually preferred for this age group.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully regarding dosage for children.

**Dosage Forms:** Colesevelam comes in tablets, granules for oral suspension (to be mixed with liquid), and chewable bars.  Always use the form prescribed by your doctor and follow the provided instructions.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Constipation
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Diarrhea (less common than constipation)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  While less frequent, some more serious side effects can occur.  These include:

* Worsening of existing heart conditions
*  High levels of triglycerides (another type of fat in the blood)
*  Changes in blood sugar levels (both high and low)
* Bowel obstruction (extremely rare, but a serious concern)

**If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

Colesevelam is a bile acid sequestrant.  Bile acids are substances your body makes to help digest fats. Colesevelam works in the intestines by binding to these bile acids, preventing them from being reabsorbed into the bloodstream. This leads to the liver using more cholesterol to make new bile acids, thus lowering cholesterol levels in the blood.  This process also indirectly improves blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes, although the exact mechanism isn't fully understood.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Colesevelam should not be used by individuals with a history of bowel obstruction,  severe triglyceride levels (over 500 mg/dL), or hypersensitivity to the medication.  It's also contraindicated in people with biliary obstruction (blockage in the bile ducts).
* **Drug Interactions:** Colesevelam can interfere with the absorption of many other medications, including some blood thinners, birth control pills, and other cholesterol-lowering drugs.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Colesevelam is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning studies in animals have not shown risk, but human studies are lacking.  Consult your doctor about the risks and benefits before using it during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Specific Populations:** People with swallowing difficulties or those at risk of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies should use caution.  Regular monitoring and potential supplementation might be necessary.
