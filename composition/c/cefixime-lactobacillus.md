# Cefixime + Lactobacillus
### Generic Name
Cefixime + Lactobacillus

**Note:**  This combination is not a single, pre-formulated drug.  It represents the use of the antibiotic Cefixime alongside the probiotic Lactobacillus.  These are often prescribed together, but the specific formulation (dosage, strain of Lactobacillus, etc.) will vary depending on the doctor's prescription.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

### Usage

This combination is primarily used to treat bacterial infections, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal tract.  Cefixime, a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, effectively targets a wide range of bacteria causing infections like:

* **Bacterial diarrhea:**  Cefixime helps eliminate the bacteria responsible for infectious diarrhea.
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):**  While not its primary use, Cefixime can treat certain bacterial UTIs.
* **Respiratory tract infections:**  Cefixime is sometimes used to treat bacterial infections in the lungs, such as bronchitis or pneumonia (often in conjunction with other antibiotics).
* **Skin infections:** In some cases, it can treat bacterial skin infections.


Lactobacillus, a probiotic, is included to mitigate the potential side effects of Cefixime, mainly disruption of the gut's natural bacterial balance (gut dysbiosis).  This dysbiosis can lead to digestive upset, such as diarrhea. Lactobacillus helps restore the healthy bacteria population in the gut, thus reducing the likelihood of this side effect.

### Dosage

Dosage for both Cefixime and Lactobacillus will be determined by your doctor based on your age, weight, the specific infection, and the severity of the condition.  There isn't a standardized combination dosage.

**Cefixime:** Dosage will typically range from 200mg to 400mg once or twice daily, usually taken orally. IV administration is possible but generally reserved for severe cases and administered under a doctor's supervision.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for children and individuals with kidney issues.

**Lactobacillus:** The dosage will depend on the specific Lactobacillus strain and product used.  It's often taken as a capsule or tablet, typically once or twice daily, usually with food.  Children's dosages will differ depending on the product.  Always follow the product instructions carefully.


### Side Effects

**Cefixime:**

* Common: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
* Less Common but Serious: Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), pseudomembranous colitis (a severe bowel infection), changes in liver function tests.

**Lactobacillus:**  Side effects are generally mild and infrequent. They can include gas, bloating, or mild discomfort.  Serious allergic reactions are rare but possible.

**Combining Cefixime and Lactobacillus:**  The probiotic may reduce the incidence of digestive issues associated with Cefixime. However, if you experience any adverse effects, stop taking the medication and consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

**Cefixime:** This antibiotic works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to build their cell walls. By disrupting this process, Cefixime prevents bacteria from multiplying and eventually leads to their death.  This effectively treats the bacterial infection.

**Lactobacillus:**  These are beneficial bacteria that naturally colonize the human gut. By supplementing with Lactobacillus, the balance of gut flora is restored or maintained. This helps prevent or reduce diarrhea and other digestive disturbances caused by antibiotics.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Inform your doctor of any allergies to cephalosporins or other antibiotics before taking Cefixime.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using Cefixime and Lactobacillus during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Kidney Disease:** Cefixime dosage may need adjustment in individuals with impaired kidney function.
* **Interactions:** Cefixime may interact with certain medications, particularly anticoagulants and oral contraceptives.  Inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking.
* **Alcohol:** Alcohol consumption should be avoided while taking Cefixime, as it can increase the risk of certain side effects.
* **Lactobacillus Interactions:** While generally safe, Lactobacillus may interact with some immunosuppressants. Consult your doctor if you have concerns.


### FAQs
