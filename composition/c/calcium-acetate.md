# Calcium Acetate
### Generic Name
Calcium Acetate

### Usage

Calcium acetate is primarily used to control high phosphate levels (hyperphosphatemia) in adults and children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are undergoing dialysis.  Hyperphosphatemia is a common complication of kidney failure, where the kidneys can no longer effectively filter phosphate from the blood.  High phosphate levels can lead to serious health problems, including damage to blood vessels and bones. Calcium acetate works by binding to phosphate in the digestive tract, preventing its absorption into the bloodstream and promoting its elimination through the stool.  While its primary use is in ESRD patients on dialysis, it may be considered in other conditions where hyperphosphatemia needs to be managed under the guidance of a nephrologist or other specialist.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the patient's age, weight, phosphate levels, and response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow the instructions provided by a healthcare professional precisely.  Here's a general overview, but this should *not* replace individual medical advice:

* **Adults (ESRD on dialysis):**  Dosage is typically individualized and starts low, then gradually increased every 2-3 weeks as needed to control phosphate levels, while carefully monitoring calcium levels to avoid hypercalcemia (high blood calcium).  Different formulations exist (tablets, capsules, oral solution), with varying strengths.  Common initial doses range from 1334 mg to 2000 mg with each meal.  Maximum daily doses can reach 6650 mg or even higher, depending on the specific product and physician's recommendations.  Additional calcium supplements are usually avoided while using calcium acetate.

* **Children and Adolescents (ESRD):**  Dosage is also individualized and started at a lower dose, typically between 667-1000 mg with each meal.  It's carefully titrated (adjusted) every 2-4 weeks based on the child's response and blood calcium levels.

**Administration:** Calcium acetate is usually taken orally with meals.  Always follow the instructions provided on the prescription label concerning how to take the medication (e.g., whether tablets should be swallowed whole or crushed).


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Diarrhea (especially with oral solution)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) – This is a serious side effect and requires immediate medical attention.

Less common but serious side effects:

* Dizziness
* Edema (swelling)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Weakness
* Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat) – especially in patients already at risk


**Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, it's vital to contact a healthcare provider immediately.  They can assess the situation and make necessary adjustments to the treatment plan.


### How it Works

Calcium acetate works as a phosphate binder.  When taken orally with meals, it binds to phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract, forming insoluble calcium phosphate.  This complex is then eliminated from the body through the feces, preventing the phosphate from being absorbed into the bloodstream. This helps to reduce the level of phosphate in the blood, managing hyperphosphatemia.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Calcium acetate is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to any component of the medication, hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), or renal calculi (kidney stones).

* **Drug Interactions:** Calcium acetate can interact with various medications, including some antibiotics, cardiac glycosides, and other drugs affecting calcium or phosphate metabolism.  It's critical to inform your healthcare provider about all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.

* **Specific Populations:**  Caution is advised in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, those taking digitalis medications, and older adults.  The use of calcium acetate during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully evaluated and only done under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.  The safety and efficacy in pregnant women have not been fully established.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take calcium acetate without a prescription?** A: No, calcium acetate is a prescription medication and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to catch up.

* **Q: How should I store calcium acetate?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, following the instructions on the prescription label.

* **Q:  Can calcium acetate cause constipation?** A: While diarrhea is a more common side effect, some patients may experience constipation.  Staying well-hydrated can help.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience hypercalcemia?** A: Hypercalcemia is a serious side effect. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as excessive thirst, frequent urination, confusion, or muscle weakness.
