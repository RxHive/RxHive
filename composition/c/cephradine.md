# Cephradine
### Generic Name
Cephradine (Cefradine)

### Usage
Cephradine is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic.  Its primary use is in treating bacterial infections.  Specifically, it's effective against a range of bacteria causing infections in several areas of the body:

* **Respiratory Tract Infections:**  Cephradine can treat infections like pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinusitis caused by susceptible bacteria.
* **Otitis Media (Middle Ear Infection):** This antibiotic is commonly used to treat middle ear infections in children and adults.
* **Skin and Skin Structure Infections:** Cephradine is effective against bacterial infections of the skin, including cellulitis and abscesses.
* **Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):** It's used to treat UTIs caused by susceptible bacteria.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and the severity of the infection.  The information below is for general knowledge and should not be used for self-medication.

**Adults:**

* **Oral:** The usual dose ranges from 250-500 mg four times daily (QID) or 500-1000 mg twice daily (BID).  Severe infections may require higher doses, up to 1000 mg QID, with a maximum daily dose of 4 grams.
* **Intravenous (IV) or Intramuscular (IM):**  The usual dose is 500-1000 mg QID, with higher doses (up to 2000 mg QID) potentially necessary for severe infections. The maximum daily dose via IV or IM is 8 grams. Specific dosing for particular infections (respiratory, skin, urinary tract) may vary.

**Children:**

Dosage for children is usually calculated based on weight (mg/kg/day) and divided into 2-4 doses.  Specific recommendations vary depending on the infection and the child's age and weight. A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dose.  The maximum daily dose is 4 grams.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with kidney problems (renal impairment).  Consult a doctor for guidance on adjusted dosages.  No specific dosage adjustment is recommended for liver problems (hepatic impairment) in current manufacturer's labeling, but this should be discussed with a physician.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Rash
* Itching

Less common but more serious side effects:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) – requiring immediate medical attention.
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) – a potentially serious bowel infection.
* Liver problems
* Kidney problems
* Blood disorders

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Cephradine is a beta-lactam antibiotic. It works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  Bacteria need a strong cell wall to survive. By inhibiting the construction of this wall, cephradine causes the bacterial cell to weaken and eventually break down and die. This process targets bacterial growth and helps the body fight infection.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Cephradine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known allergies to cephalosporin antibiotics or penicillin.  Those with a history of penicillin allergy should be carefully evaluated before receiving cephradine due to the risk of cross-reactivity.
* **Kidney Problems:**  Individuals with kidney disease may require dosage adjustments to prevent the drug from accumulating to harmful levels.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Cephradine is categorized as Pregnancy Category B (animal studies have shown no risk, but human studies are lacking).  While it's excreted in breast milk, the decision to use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, carefully weighing the benefits and risks.
* **Other Medications:** Cephradine can interact with other medications, such as aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, and probenecid.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Alcohol Consumption:** While no direct interaction is specified, it's generally advisable to avoid alcohol while on antibiotics.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take cephradine with other medications?**  A:  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements you are taking before starting cephradine to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: How should I store cephradine?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: You may start to feel better within a few days, but it's essential to complete the full course of treatment even if you feel better sooner.
* **Q:  Is cephradine safe for children?** A: Yes, but the dosage must be carefully determined by a physician based on the child's weight and the infection.
* **Q: What should I do if I have an allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, hives, or severe skin rash.
