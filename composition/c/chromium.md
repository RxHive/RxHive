# Chromium
### Generic Name
Chromium

### Usage
Chromium is an essential trace mineral.  While the body needs only small amounts, it plays a vital role in glucose metabolism, impacting how the body uses carbohydrates and fats for energy.  Chromium's role in insulin function is a significant area of research.  It's believed to enhance insulin's ability to transport glucose into cells.  This makes it a potential area of study for managing blood sugar levels and improving insulin sensitivity, particularly in individuals with insulin resistance. Some studies suggest potential benefits in managing cholesterol levels, though more research is needed to confirm these effects.  Currently, chromium's primary use is as a dietary supplement to address potential deficiencies, not as a primary treatment for any specific disease.  It's crucial to remember that chromium supplementation should not replace standard medical treatment for conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol.


### Dosage
The recommended daily intake of chromium varies according to age and sex.  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) established adequate intakes (AI) as follows:

**Adults:**

* Males 14-50 years: 35 mcg/day
* Males >50 years: 30 mcg/day
* Females 19-50 years: 25 mcg/day
* Females >50 years: 20 mcg/day
* Pregnancy: 30 mcg/day
* Lactation: 45 mcg/day

**Children:**  Adequate intake values for children are much lower and vary greatly by age group (see detailed pediatric values in the original source material).  Consult a healthcare professional for appropriate pediatric dosage.

**Chromium Supplementation:**  When used as a supplement, various forms exist, including chromium chloride, nicotinate, picolinate, and those found in brewer's yeast. The dosage of supplemental chromium varies greatly depending on the form and intended use, ranging from 50 mcg to 1000 mcg per day. However, higher doses are associated with potential genotoxic effects.  Always follow the instructions on the supplement label and discuss appropriate dosage with a healthcare professional.

**Important Note:**  The medical use of chromium is not well-established.  Do not use chromium supplementation to replace standard medical treatment.



### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and infrequent at recommended doses.  However, higher doses may lead to increased risk of the following:

* Nausea
* Headaches
* Dizziness
* Skin rashes


Less common, but potentially serious side effects may include:  Liver damage and kidney problems.  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Chromium's primary mechanism of action involves its role as a cofactor for a protein called Glucose Tolerance Factor (GTF). GTF assists insulin in transporting glucose from the bloodstream into cells for energy production. By improving insulin sensitivity, chromium may potentially help regulate blood sugar levels and improve glucose metabolism.  Its effects on cholesterol levels are less clearly understood and require more research.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Chromium is contraindicated in individuals with a known allergy to chromium or related compounds (like those in leather).
* **Renal Impairment:**  Chromium picolinate is contraindicated in individuals with kidney problems.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments for liver problems aren't established, and liver damage has been reported with some chromium forms.
* **Other Medications:** Interactions with other medications are not well-documented but should be discussed with a healthcare professional.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  While chromium may be safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding at levels close to the recommended daily intake, higher doses are not advised.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I get enough chromium from my diet?**  A:  Most people obtain adequate chromium through a balanced diet.  However, deficiencies can occur, particularly in individuals with specific dietary restrictions or those with underlying health conditions.
* **Q:  Is chromium safe?** A: Chromium is generally considered safe at recommended dosages. However, higher doses may lead to adverse effects. Consult a healthcare professional before starting chromium supplementation.
* **Q: How should I store chromium supplements?** A:  Follow the storage instructions on the product label. Usually, this involves storing in a cool, dry place, away from moisture and light.
* **Q:  Can chromium cure diabetes or lower cholesterol?** A: No. Chromium supplementation is not a cure for diabetes or a replacement for cholesterol-lowering medications. It might support glucose metabolism and insulin function, but more research is needed to confirm these effects fully.  Always consult a healthcare provider for the management of diabetes and high cholesterol.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: If you experience any adverse effects, stop taking the supplement and contact your healthcare provider immediately.
