# Calamine + Diphenhydramine + Camphor

**Generic Name:**  Calamine, Diphenhydramine, and Camphor Lotion (Note: There isn't one single generic name for this combination.  The listed ingredients are the generic names of the active components.)


**Usage:** This combination lotion is typically used for the temporary relief of itching and minor skin irritations associated with:

* Insect bites and stings
* Minor burns
* Sunburn
* Eczema
* Chickenpox
* Poison ivy/oak/sumac

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Skin irritation:**  Redness, burning, swelling, or rash at the application site. This is more likely with sensitive skin.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions are possible, including hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.  Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* **Diphenhydramine-related side effects:**  While the amount of diphenhydramine in this lotion is generally low, applying it over large areas of skin or using it frequently could lead to drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, or constipation (if absorbed systemically). These are more commonly seen with oral diphenhydramine.
* **Camphor-related side effects:** Camphor can cause skin irritation in some individuals. High doses or ingestion can lead to more serious problems (not likely with topical application).


**How it Works:**

* **Calamine:**  A mild astringent that soothes irritated skin and helps dry out weeping lesions (like those from insect bites or chickenpox). It also has some mild antiseptic properties.
* **Diphenhydramine:** An antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body in response to injury or allergic reactions.  This helps reduce itching.
* **Camphor:** Acts as a counterirritant, meaning it produces a mild sensation that can distract from the underlying itch. It also has some mild anesthetic properties.
