# Canaglifozin + Metformin
### Generic Name
Canagliflozin + Metformin

### Usage

Canagliflozin and Metformin is a combination drug used to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults.  It's used as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control.  This combination is appropriate when treatment with both Canagliflozin and Metformin individually is deemed necessary by a healthcare professional.  Importantly, Canagliflozin also helps reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes who already have established cardiovascular disease.  This combination is *not* suitable for type 1 diabetes or for treating diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors including the patient's current medication regimen, renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate or eGFR), and overall health.  It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized dosage instructions.  The following provides general information only:

* **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:**  Dosage varies depending on whether the patient is already taking either Canagliflozin or Metformin or neither.  The drug is available in immediate-release and extended-release formulations. Dosages are typically started low and gradually increased based on tolerability and response.  The maximum daily dose is 300 mg of Canagliflozin and 2000 mg of Metformin.  Specific instructions on how to adjust the dose based on existing medication and eGFR are complex and require guidance from a physician.

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on eGFR.  For eGFR values below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², the Canagliflozin dose must be reduced or the medication may be contraindicated entirely (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m² or patients on dialysis).

* **Hepatic Impairment:** This combination is generally not recommended for patients with hepatic impairment.

* **Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of this combination in children under 18 have not been established.

* **Administration:** Immediate-release tablets should be taken twice daily with meals. Extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole with the morning meal; do not crush, break, or chew.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* **Canagliflozin:**  Female genital yeast infections.
* **Metformin:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence.

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* **Canagliflozin:**  Hypotension, hypovolemia, increased urinary tract infections, ketoacidosis,  lower limb amputations,  acute kidney injury,  hypersensitivity reactions,  bone fractures, hyperkalemia.
* **Metformin:** Lactic acidosis (rare but life-threatening), liver injury, vitamin B12 deficiency.

*Note:* This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Canagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor. It works in the kidneys by blocking the reabsorption of glucose into the bloodstream, thus increasing the excretion of glucose in the urine. Metformin is a biguanide that works in several ways to lower blood glucose levels: it reduces glucose production in the liver, decreases glucose absorption in the gut, and improves how the body uses insulin.  The combination of these two drugs provides a synergistic effect on blood glucose control.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This combination is contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity to either drug, diabetic ketoacidosis, moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²), end-stage renal disease, or those on dialysis.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Canagliflozin and Metformin can interact with other medications.  This includes drugs that affect renal function,  insulin or other diabetes medications,  and certain drugs metabolized by the same enzymes.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Alcohol:** Avoid excessive alcohol consumption as it can increase the risk of lactic acidosis with Metformin.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Canagliflozin and Metformin are not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Discuss alternative treatment options with your healthcare provider if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.


* **Iodinated Contrast Media:** Metformin should be discontinued before procedures involving iodinated contrast media, particularly in patients with impaired renal function.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use caution in elderly patients due to increased risk of renal impairment.

* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels, HbA1c, renal function, and other relevant parameters is essential.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The time it takes to see improvements in blood sugar control varies depending on the individual.  It may take several weeks or months to achieve optimal results.

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication if my blood sugar is under control?** A:  No, do not stop taking this medication without consulting your healthcare provider.  Stopping abruptly can negatively impact your health.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
