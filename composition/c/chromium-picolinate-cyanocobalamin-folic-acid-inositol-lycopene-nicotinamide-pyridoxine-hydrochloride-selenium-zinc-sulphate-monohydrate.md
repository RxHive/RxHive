# Chromium Picolinate + Cyanocobalamin + Folic Acid + Inositol + Lycopene + Nicotinamide + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + Selenium + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate
### Generic Name
Chromium Picolinate + Cyanocobalamin + Folic Acid + Inositol + Lycopene + Nicotinamide + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + Selenium + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate


This is not a single generic medicine with one active ingredient, but rather a combination of multiple nutritional supplements.  Therefore, a standard generic name doesn't exist.  The following information addresses each component individually and their combined potential benefits.  It's crucial to remember that this information is for general knowledge and shouldn't substitute advice from a healthcare professional.  Always consult a doctor or registered dietitian before starting any new supplement regimen.


### Usage

This combination of supplements is often marketed to support overall health and well-being, targeting several areas:

* **Metabolism and Energy Production:** Chromium picolinate may help improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.  Nicotinamide (niacinamide), a form of vitamin B3, plays a vital role in energy production.  
* **Blood Health:** Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) and folic acid (vitamin B9) are crucial for red blood cell formation and preventing anemia.
* **Antioxidant Support:** Lycopene, selenium, and zinc are potent antioxidants that help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals.
* **Nervous System Function:**  Pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), and inositol contribute to the proper functioning of the nervous system.
* **Skin and Hair Health:**  Biotin (often included in similar formulations, though not listed here) and zinc are important for maintaining healthy skin, hair, and nails.


It's important to understand that while these nutrients play vital roles in health, this combination isn't a treatment for specific diseases.  It's primarily marketed as a nutritional supplement to support overall well-being and address potential deficiencies.


### Dosage

There's no single standardized dosage for this combination supplement.  The amount of each component varies significantly between brands.  Always follow the manufacturer's instructions on the product label.  It is essential to consult a doctor or registered dietitian to determine the appropriate dosage based on individual needs and health status.

Side effects are generally rare and mild at recommended dosages for each individual component. However, some potential side effects include:

* **Chromium Picolinate:**  Upset stomach, headache.
* **Cyanocobalamin:**  Rare, but can include allergic reactions.
* **Folic Acid:**  Rarely, gastrointestinal upset.
