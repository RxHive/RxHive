# Copper
### Generic Name
Copper

### Usage

Copper supplements are primarily used to prevent or treat copper deficiency.  This deficiency can arise from various causes, including malnutrition, malabsorption syndromes (conditions that impair the body's ability to absorb nutrients), and certain genetic disorders.  While some promote copper for wound healing, osteoarthritis, and osteoporosis,  scientific evidence supporting these uses is limited and requires further research.  Copper's role in these conditions is not fully understood, and its effectiveness isn't definitively established.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using copper supplements for any condition beyond treating a diagnosed copper deficiency.

### Dosage

Dosage for copper supplements varies significantly depending on the individual's needs and the reason for supplementation.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare professional's specific instructions.  General guidelines, however, include:

* **To Prevent Deficiency (Oral):**
    * Adult and teenage males: 1.5-2.5 mg/day
    * Adult and teenage females: 1.5-3 mg/day
    * Children 7-10 years: 1-2 mg/day
    * Children 4-6 years: 1-1.5 mg/day
    * Children birth to 3 years: 0.4-1 mg/day

* **To Treat Deficiency:** The dosage is determined individually by a healthcare provider based on the severity of the deficiency. This often involves higher doses than those used for prevention and may require monitoring of blood copper levels.

**Important Note:**  These are general guidelines.  Precise dosage and the form of copper (e.g., copper gluconate, copper sulfate) will be determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and health status.

### Side Effects

While generally safe in recommended doses, copper supplements can cause side effects, including:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Copper toxicity (which can be fatal), if taken in excessive amounts. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, fever, stomach pain, low blood pressure, anemia, and heart problems.

If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Copper is an essential trace mineral that plays a vital role in numerous bodily functions, including:

* **Enzyme function:**  Copper is a component of various enzymes involved in energy production, iron metabolism, and connective tissue formation.
* **Antioxidant defense:** Copper contributes to the body's antioxidant defense system, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals.
* **Collagen synthesis:** Copper is essential for the synthesis of collagen, a protein crucial for the structure and strength of bones, skin, and other tissues.

In cases of copper deficiency, supplementing with copper helps restore adequate levels of this mineral, allowing the body to perform its essential functions properly.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Copper supplements are contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to copper or related metals.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Avoid taking copper supplements concurrently with oral iron supplements, oral or parenteral zinc, D-penicillamine, or trientine, as these can inhibit copper absorption.  Excessive molybdenum intake may also interfere with copper absorption.
* **Warnings:**  Use caution in individuals with liver disease, biliary disease, or Wilson's disease (a genetic disorder leading to copper accumulation).  Copper toxicity is a serious risk, especially with higher doses or prolonged use.  
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Copper is categorized as pregnancy category C. This means that the effects on a developing fetus are not fully known. Consult a healthcare professional before using copper supplements during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  The recommended intake during pregnancy may be slightly higher than usual, but this must be guided by a doctor.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take copper supplements without consulting a doctor?** A: No. It's essential to consult a doctor before starting any copper supplement regimen, particularly if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.  Copper toxicity is a serious concern.
* **Q: How should I store copper supplements?** A: Store copper supplements in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat, in a tightly closed container.  Keep them out of reach of children.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of using copper supplements?** A:  Long-term effects are generally not well-studied.  However,  prolonged use of high doses can lead to copper toxicity.  It's crucial to follow recommended dosages and consult with a healthcare professional.
* **Q:  Are there any dietary sources of copper?** A: Yes.  Copper is found in a variety of foods, including organ meats (especially liver), seafood, beans, nuts, and whole grains.  Using copper cookware can also increase dietary copper intake.
