# Cetylpyridinium
### Generic Name
Cetylpyridinium Chloride

### Usage
Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) is a broad-spectrum antiseptic primarily used in oral hygiene products. Its main application is as an active ingredient in mouthwashes, toothpaste, lozenges, and sprays to treat and prevent oral infections.  CPC's antiseptic action targets a wide range of bacteria, fungi, and viruses commonly found in the mouth, thus helping to control plaque, gingivitis (gum inflammation), and other minor oral infections such as sore throats.  While primarily used in the mouth, CPC also finds limited topical application for the treatment of minor superficial wounds and burns.  However, its use in these instances is generally restricted to small, localized areas.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the product formulation and the condition being treated.  Always follow the instructions on the product label.

**Adults:**

* **Sore Throat:**  For oral rinse solutions containing 0.025% CPC, gargle with 15 mL of undiluted liquid twice or three times daily. Do not swallow.
* **Mouth Infections/Oral Hygiene:** As a mouthwash, rinse the mouth with 15-20 mL of a 0.025% solution for 30 seconds, twice or three times daily.  Do not swallow.
* **Minor Skin Wounds/Superficial Burns:** Apply undiluted 0.025% CPC liquid topically to the affected area.

**Children (generally â‰¥6 years):**

Dosage for children 6 years and older is generally the same as for adults, but always supervise young children using mouthwashes to prevent accidental ingestion.  For topical use on children, consult a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Mouth irritation
* Tongue or teeth discoloration

Less common, but more serious side effects may include allergic reactions (hypersensitivity).  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, discontinue use and consult a doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Cetylpyridinium chloride is a cationic (positively charged) antiseptic.  It works by disrupting the cell membranes of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. This disruption causes leakage of essential cellular components, leading to cell death and thus inhibiting the growth of microorganisms.  This mechanism provides its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.

### Precautions
* **Contraindication:**  Do not use CPC if you are allergic to cetylpyridinium chloride or any other ingredient in the product.
* **Accidental Ingestion:**  Keep out of reach of children. Accidental ingestion, particularly by young children, can be dangerous.  If ingestion occurs, seek immediate medical attention.
* **Children:** Supervise children closely when using oral rinse products containing CPC to prevent accidental swallowing.  Use in children should be under the guidance of a healthcare provider.
* **Topical Use:**  Avoid using CPC on large areas of skin or for extended periods without consulting a healthcare professional.  Avoid contact with eyes.
* **Interactions:** While generally considered safe, consult your doctor or pharmacist if you are using other medications, particularly if you have any pre-existing health conditions.
