# Conjugated estrogens + Bazedoxifene
### Generic Name
Conjugated estrogens + Bazedoxifene

### Usage

Conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene is a combination medication used for two primary purposes in postmenopausal women with a uterus:

1. **Treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause:**  These symptoms, often called hot flashes or night sweats, are common during menopause and can significantly impact quality of life. This combination medication helps alleviate these symptoms.

2. **Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis:**  After menopause, bone density decreases, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. This medication helps maintain bone mineral density, reducing the risk of developing osteoporosis.

It's important to note that this medication is intended for postmenopausal women only and should be used for the shortest duration consistent with the individual's treatment goals and risks.


### Dosage

The usual adult dosage is one tablet (containing 0.45 mg of conjugated estrogens and 20 mg of bazedoxifene) taken orally once daily.

* **Vasomotor Symptoms:** When used to treat menopausal symptoms, the dosage and duration should be determined individually by a healthcare professional, based on the patient's response, risk factors, and overall health.  Regular evaluation is necessary.

* **Osteoporosis Prevention:** When prescribed solely for osteoporosis prevention, it should only be considered for women at significant risk, and other non-estrogen therapies should be evaluated first.

This medication is **not indicated for use in children**.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not recommended; the medication is contraindicated in individuals with hepatic dysfunction or disease.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Dizziness
* Oropharyngeal pain (pain in the mouth and throat)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Upper abdominal pain
* Muscle spasm
* Neck pain

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include an increased risk of blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), stroke, and heart attack.  There's also an increased risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer (though this combination medication is designed to mitigate endometrial hyperplasia, a precursor to endometrial cancer), probable dementia (especially in women 65 and older), and other conditions.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported immediately to a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Conjugated estrogens are a mixture of different estrogen compounds that act as estrogen agonists, mimicking the effects of the body's natural estrogen. Bazedoxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).  It acts as both an agonist (mimicking estrogen) and an antagonist (blocking estrogen), depending on the tissue.

The combination creates a "tissue-selective estrogen complex." This means it provides the benefits of estrogen in relieving vasomotor symptoms and protecting bone density while mitigating some of the risks associated with unopposed estrogen, particularly the increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated (should not be used) in women with a history or current diagnosis of breast cancer, estrogen-dependent tumors, undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding, blood clots (venous or arterial thromboembolism),  known thrombophilic disorders (like protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency), hepatic impairment or disease, or those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

* **Interactions:**  Conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene can interact with numerous other medications.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some interactions may require dosage adjustments or avoidance of certain combinations.

* **Warnings:** There is an increased risk of several serious conditions associated with this medication, including cardiovascular events, blood clots, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and probable dementia.  The lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible.

* **Special Populations:**  Use in women over 75 years of age is generally not recommended. Women with conditions such as asthma, diabetes, gallbladder disease, or a history of migraines should be carefully monitored while taking this medication.
