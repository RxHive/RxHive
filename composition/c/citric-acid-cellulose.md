# Citric acid + Cellulose
### Generic Name
Citric Acid + Cellulose

### Usage

Citric acid and cellulose, when combined, are used as a weight-management aid for overweight and obese adults.  Specifically, it's indicated for individuals with a body mass index (BMI) ranging from 25 to 40 kg/m².  It's crucial to understand that this combination is not a standalone solution but rather a supplement to a comprehensive weight-loss program that includes a balanced diet and regular exercise.  The primary goal is to assist in weight loss by promoting a feeling of fullness and satiety, thus potentially reducing overall calorie intake.  There are no other notable secondary uses currently approved.

### Dosage

The typical dosage for adults (overweight and obese individuals with a BMI of 25-40 kg/m²) is 2.25 grams taken twice daily, once before lunch and once before dinner.  Each dose should be taken with a full glass of water (approximately 16 ounces or 500ml), and another 16 ounces of water should be consumed immediately after.  If a dose is missed, it can be taken during or immediately after a meal.  The medication comes in capsule form.  The dosage is not adjusted based on age, weight, or the severity of obesity.  There are no specific dosage recommendations for children as this combination is not typically indicated for pediatric use.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea and abdominal distention.  Less common side effects (1-10% of patients) may include changes in bowel habits, flatulence (gas), and abdominal pain.  While rare, more serious adverse effects are possible. If you experience severe abdominal pain or persistent diarrhea, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Citric acid and cellulose, when combined, form a three-dimensional matrix within the digestive tract. This matrix expands in the stomach and small intestine, creating a feeling of fullness and increased satiety.  This mechanism helps to reduce overall food intake by making individuals feel less hungry, thereby aiding in weight loss when combined with dietary and lifestyle changes. The combination is not systemically absorbed, meaning it doesn't enter the bloodstream in significant amounts.

### Precautions

Citric acid and cellulose are contraindicated (should not be used) in pregnant women and individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to cellulose, citric acid, sodium stearyl fumarate, gelatin, titanium dioxide, or any other component of the formulation.  This combination should be used cautiously in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disorders.  It's important to note that while this combination aids in weight management, it is not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle encompassing balanced nutrition and regular physical activity.  Individuals with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) should use extra caution and consult a doctor before using this medication.
