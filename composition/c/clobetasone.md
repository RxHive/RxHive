# Clobetasone
### Generic Name
Clobetasone

### Usage
Clobetasone is a moderately potent topical corticosteroid primarily used to treat and manage small areas of eczema and dermatitis.  This includes conditions like atopic eczema (also known as atopic dermatitis), and both irritant and allergic contact dermatitis.  While primarily a topical treatment for skin conditions, clobetasone is also available as an ophthalmic solution for certain inflammatory eye disorders.

### Dosage

**Topical (Skin):**

* **Adults and children ≥12 years:**  For dermatitis and eczema, apply a thin layer of 0.05% clobetasone cream or ointment sparingly to the affected area twice daily (BID) for up to seven days.  The maximum recommended weekly dose is 15 grams.  If the condition improves within seven days, discontinue treatment.  Gradually reduce use once the condition is under control and continue with an emollient for maintenance.  Always use the least amount needed for the shortest time possible.

* **Children <12 years:**  Use in children under 12 should be under strict medical supervision.  The dosage and duration of treatment should be determined by a healthcare professional.


**Ophthalmic (Eye):**

* **Adults:** For inflammatory eye disorders, one drop of 0.1% clobetasone eye drops is typically administered twice daily (BID) as directed by an ophthalmologist.


**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not specifically outlined in manufacturer labeling.  In such cases, the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration should be used.

### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Skin irritation (burning, itching, dryness), skin thinning (atrophy), and stretch marks (striae).

* **Less Common but Serious:**  Cushing's syndrome (with prolonged or high-dose use), increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia), increased intraocular pressure (IOP), cataracts,  delayed growth in children, adrenal suppression, osteoporosis, allergic reactions (including contact dermatitis), and increased susceptibility to infections.


If you experience any adverse effects, especially if they are persistent or severe, consult your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Clobetasone is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation in the body. It achieves this through several mechanisms: it decreases the number and activity of mast cells (which release inflammatory substances), reduces the movement and activation of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell involved in inflammation), inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines (signaling molecules), and reduces the production of substances involved in inflammation through the inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolism.  By targeting these different pathways, clobetasone effectively reduces the inflammation associated with eczema and other inflammatory skin conditions and some eye conditions.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Clobetasone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to clobetasone or any component of the formulation; viral skin infections (e.g., chickenpox, shingles, herpes simplex); bacterial skin infections (e.g., impetigo); fungal skin infections (e.g., ringworm, athlete's foot); acne vulgaris; rosacea; perioral dermatitis; and when using the ophthalmic solution with soft contact lenses.  It should also be avoided in cases of pruritus without rash and psoriasis.

* **Warnings:**  Use cautiously in elderly patients, pregnant women, breastfeeding women,  patients with a history of hypersensitivity to other corticosteroids, patients with stasis dermatitis, or other skin diseases associated with impaired circulation.  Prolonged use or use on large skin areas can increase the risk of systemic effects (e.g., Cushing’s syndrome).  Ophthalmic use may cause blurred vision.  Do not use on broken skin.

* **Interactions:** Clobetasone can interact with certain medications, including live vaccines, barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, rifampicin, thiazide diuretics, furosemide, NSAIDs, anticoagulants, salicylates, antimuscarinics, aldesleukin, itraconazole, and ritonavir. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions if you are taking other medications.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of clobetasone during pregnancy and lactation is not fully established.  Topical corticosteroids are generally preferred over systemic corticosteroids during pregnancy for conditions like psoriasis or atopic dermatitis, but extensive or prolonged use should be avoided.  Avoid applying to the nipples during breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use clobetasone on my face?**  A:  Use on the face, scalp, genitals, groin, axilla, or between toes should only be under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional due to increased risk of side effects.

* **Q: How should I store clobetasone?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: Improvement should be seen within a few days, but complete resolution may take longer.  If there's no improvement after a week, consult your doctor.

* **Q: Can I use clobetasone with other skin creams?** A:  Check with your doctor or pharmacist before combining clobetasone with other topical medications to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not apply a double dose.
