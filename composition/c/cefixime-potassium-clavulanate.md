# Cefixime + Potassium Clavulanate

**Generic Name:** Cefixime + Potassium Clavulanate

**Usage:** This combination antibiotic is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections.  The specific infections it treats will vary depending on local guidelines and the severity of the infection. Common uses include:

* **Respiratory tract infections:** Bronchitis, pneumonia (in some cases)
* **Ear infections (otitis media):** Particularly those resistant to other antibiotics.
* **Skin and skin structure infections:** Abscesses, cellulitis (in some cases)
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):**  Both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs (depending on the severity and the infecting bacteria)


**It is crucial to understand that Cefixime + Potassium Clavulanate should only be used to treat bacterial infections, and not viral infections (like the common cold or flu).  Improper use can lead to antibiotic resistance.**  A doctor should always be consulted to determine if this is the appropriate treatment.


**Side Effects:** Like all medications, Cefixime + Potassium Clavulanate can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis)**
* **Changes in taste**

More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* **Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD):**  This can be a serious, potentially life-threatening complication.
* **Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis):** This requires immediate medical attention.
* **Liver problems:**  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, and abdominal pain.
* **Kidney problems:**  Monitor for changes in urine output.


**How it Works:**

Cefixime is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It works by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.  Potassium Clavulanate is a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by some bacteria that break down beta-lactam antibiotics (like Cefixime), rendering them ineffective.  By inhibiting these enzymes, Potassium Clavulanate extends the effectiveness of Cefixime against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant.  Together, they provide broader-spectrum antibacterial activity.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take Cefixime + Potassium Clavulanate with other medications?**  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Interactions can occur.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Cefixime + Potassium Clavulanate?**  Alcohol may worsen some side effects, especially gastrointestinal ones.  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.  Consult your doctor.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **How long should I take this medication?**  The duration of treatment is determined by your doctor and depends on the type and severity of your infection.  Do not stop taking the medication prematurely, even if you feel better.
