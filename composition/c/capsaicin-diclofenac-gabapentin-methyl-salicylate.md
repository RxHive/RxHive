# Capsaicin + Diclofenac + Gabapentin + Methyl Salicylate

It's crucial to understand that there is **no single FDA-approved or commercially available generic combination drug containing Capsaicin, Diclofenac, Gabapentin, and Methyl Salicylate.**  These ingredients are frequently used individually or in some pairwise combinations for pain relief, but not all together in one product.  Attempting to combine them without professional guidance is dangerous.

Therefore, providing details in the requested format is impossible because such a combination doesn't exist in a standardized, regulated form.  Using these ingredients together requires careful consideration from a medical professional due to potential drug interactions and adverse effects.

**Instead of providing information on a non-existent drug, let's look at the individual components and their common uses:**

**Capsaicin:**

* **Generic Name:** Capsaicin

* **Usage:** Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for pain and inflammation.
