# Cetilistat
### Generic Name
Cetilistat

### Usage
Cetilistat is a medication used to manage obesity.  It's specifically indicated for adults with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia (abnormal levels of fats in the blood) who have a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m² or higher, despite efforts to lose weight through diet and exercise.  It's important to note that Cetilistat is an adjunct therapy; it works best in conjunction with lifestyle modifications like diet and exercise.  It is not a standalone solution for weight loss.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The recommended dose is 120 mg, taken orally three times a day (TID), immediately after each main meal.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Cetilistat in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Cetilistat should be used cautiously in patients with liver or kidney disease.  Close monitoring of liver and kidney function tests may be necessary, and dosage adjustments or alternative treatments might be required depending on the patient's condition.

### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

*   Fat in the stool
*   Abdominal cramping
*   Flatulence (gas) with discharge
*   Oily spotting
*   Bowel incontinence
*   Abdominal pain
*   Diarrhea
*   Soft stools

Less common, but potentially serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Cetilistat is a pancreatic lipase inhibitor.  Pancreatic lipase is an enzyme your body uses to break down fats (triglycerides) in the food you eat. By inhibiting this enzyme, Cetilistat prevents the absorption of dietary fats.  The undigested fats are then eliminated from the body through the stool, leading to a reduction in calorie intake and contributing to weight loss.

### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:** Cetilistat is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to Cetilistat or its ingredients, chronic malabsorption syndrome, or cholestasis (a condition where bile flow is blocked).
*   **Warnings:**  Increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects like diarrhea, bloating, loss of appetite, and flatulence is possible.  Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney impairment, diabetes, or who are elderly.  It's not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women or patients with a recent history of organ transplantation.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Although specific interactions aren't extensively detailed, it's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting Cetilistat to minimize the risk of potential interactions.
*   **Alcohol:** Patients should avoid consuming alcohol while taking Cetilistat.
