# Calcium Gluconate + Calcium Lactate
### Generic Name
Calcium Gluconate + Calcium Lactate

### Usage

This combination medication provides supplemental calcium.  Calcium is a crucial mineral for numerous bodily functions, including building and maintaining strong bones and teeth, muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and blood clotting.  This combination is primarily used to treat or prevent calcium deficiency (hypocalcemia). Hypocalcemia can arise from various causes, including inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption issues (like in celiac disease or Crohn's disease), certain kidney disorders, and hormonal imbalances (such as hypoparathyroidism).  Secondary uses might include supporting bone health in individuals at risk of osteoporosis or those recovering from fractures, although this is usually done with other medications tailored for bone health.  Always consult a doctor to determine if this combination is the appropriate treatment for your specific calcium deficiency or bone health needs.

### Dosage

Dosage of Calcium Gluconate + Calcium Lactate varies greatly depending on the individual's specific calcium needs, age, overall health, and the severity of any calcium deficiency.  There is no single standard dosage.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dose based on blood calcium levels, medical history, and other relevant factors.  

Dosage forms will typically be oral (tablets or capsules).  Intravenous (IV) administration of calcium gluconate is used separately, in emergency situations, and is not generally used with calcium lactate in combination.  Therefore, specific IV dosage information for this combination is not applicable.

**Oral Dosage:**  A doctor will prescribe a specific daily dose and regimen. It's crucial to follow these instructions precisely.

**Important:**  Never attempt to self-medicate with calcium supplements.  Overdosing on calcium can have serious health consequences.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach upset or pain
* Gas
* Headache

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, can include:

* Kidney stones (especially with pre-existing kidney problems)
* Irregular heartbeat
* Elevated blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia) â€“ this needs immediate medical attention.


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Calcium gluconate and calcium lactate are both salts of calcium.  When ingested, these salts are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, increasing the level of calcium in the bloodstream.  This replenishes calcium stores in the body, helping to correct deficiencies and support various physiological processes that rely on adequate calcium levels, such as muscle function, nerve transmission, and bone health.

### Precautions

* **Kidney disease:**  Individuals with kidney problems should use this medication with extreme caution as it can increase the risk of kidney stone formation and worsen kidney function.  
* **Hypercalcemia:**  This medication should not be used in individuals with already high blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia).
* **Digestive issues:**  Individuals with pre-existing gastrointestinal disorders may experience worsened symptoms.
* **Medication interactions:**  This combination can interact with certain medications, including some antibiotics, heart medications, and diuretics.  Always inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, as the calcium needs during these periods are often altered.
* **Older adults:**  Older adults are more prone to kidney issues, therefore, special care needs to be taken with calcium supplementation in this population.
