# Calcium Gluconate + Calcium Lactate

**Generic Name:** Calcium Gluconate + Calcium Lactate (combination product)  *Note:  There isn't a single, universally approved generic name for a combined calcium gluconate and calcium lactate product.  The names will vary by manufacturer.*

**Usage:**

Calcium gluconate and calcium lactate are both calcium salts used to treat or prevent hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels).  A combination product might be used when a higher calcium level is needed or if a physician prefers the combination for a particular patient's needs.  Specific uses might include:

* **Hypocalcemia:**  Treating low blood calcium levels due to various causes, including parathyroid disorders, vitamin D deficiency, or malabsorption.
* **Preventing hypocalcemia:** During and after certain surgical procedures, or in individuals at risk for low calcium levels due to specific medical conditions.
* **Treatment of tetany:** Severe muscle spasms and cramps associated with hypocalcemia.
* **Emergency treatment of hyperkalemia (high potassium):**  Calcium gluconate is the more common choice in this situation, and it's administered intravenously.  The combination may be used depending on the specific protocol or if oral calcium is needed for prolonged management.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild and infrequent with oral administration, but intravenous administration carries a greater risk.  Potential side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, constipation, heartburn, abdominal pain.
* **Cardiovascular:**  Rapid heartbeat, irregular heartbeat (especially with intravenous administration).  High doses of calcium can lead to serious cardiac arrhythmias.
* **Other:**  Headache, dizziness, fatigue, metallic taste, kidney stones (with long-term use), dry mouth.  Intravenous administration can cause local irritation at the injection site.

**How it Works:**

Both calcium gluconate and calcium lactate are salts of calcium, an essential mineral.  They work by increasing the levels of calcium in the blood.  Calcium is crucial for many bodily functions, including muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and bone health.  The gluconate and lactate forms are simply different ways to deliver calcium ions to the body; they are readily absorbed and metabolized.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is this combination product better than using just calcium gluconate or calcium lactate alone?** A:  There's no definitive answer. The choice depends on the individual patient's needs, the severity of hypocalcemia, and the physician's preference.  Sometimes a combination may be chosen for improved absorption or to deliver a higher total calcium dose.

* **Q:  What are the differences between calcium gluconate and calcium lactate?** A: Both provide calcium. Calcium gluconate is more readily available for intravenous administration. The absorption of oral formulations may vary slightly depending on the individual.

* **Q: Can I take this medication without a doctor's prescription?** A: No. Calcium supplements, even in combination, should only be taken under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Self-treating hypocalcemia can be dangerous.

* **Q:  Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, calcium can interact with several medications, including some antibiotics, heart medications, and diuretics.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects, such as rapid or irregular heartbeat, severe abdominal pain, or allergic reactions.
