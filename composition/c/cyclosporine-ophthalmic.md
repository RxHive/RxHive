# Cyclosporine (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Cyclosporine (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Cyclosporine ophthalmic solution or emulsion is primarily used to treat keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye disease).  This condition results from insufficient tear production, leading to eye irritation, dryness, and discomfort.  Cyclosporine helps to increase tear production by partially modulating the immune response that contributes to the inflammation underlying dry eye.  While not its primary indication, it may also be used off-label in the treatment and prevention of severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis, a type of allergic conjunctivitis.

### Dosage

**Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca:**

* **Adults:**  The usual dose is one drop in each eye twice daily (BID), approximately 12 hours apart.  This can be used with artificial tears, but a 15-minute interval between applications is recommended.  Both 0.09% solution and 0.05%/0.1% emulsion formulations are available.
* **Children:** Safety and efficacy haven't been established for children under 16 years (0.09% solution) or under 18 years (0.05% emulsion).  For adolescents 16 and older (0.05% emulsion) or 18 and older (0.09% solution), the dosage is the same as for adults.

**Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (Off-Label Use):**

* **Treatment:**  Dosage varies depending on the formulation and age:
    * Emulsion 0.05%:  One drop in the affected eye(s) four times daily (QID) for children aged 5 to 14 years.
    * Emulsion 0.1%: One drop in the affected eye(s) QID for children 4 years and older and adolescents.
* **Prevention:** Emulsion 0.05%: One drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID) for children aged 6 years and older and adolescents.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by manufacturers for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment due to the low systemic absorption of ophthalmic cyclosporine. However, it's crucial to consult with a doctor for personalized advice, especially in patients with severe liver or kidney disease.

### Side Effects

* **Common (greater than 10%):** Eye pain, burning sensation in the eyes.
* **Less Common (1-10%):** Headache, foreign body sensation in the eye, blurred vision, conjunctival hyperemia (redness), blepharitis (eyelid inflammation), excessive tearing (epiphora), eye discharge, eye irritation, itching (pruritus), stinging of the eyes, visual disturbances, urinary tract infection.
* **Rare (less than 1%, post-marketing reports):** Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions).

If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones, seek medical attention immediately.

### How it Works
The precise mechanism of ophthalmic cyclosporine isn't fully understood. While systemically, it's a potent immunosuppressant, its topical action in the eye is thought to be a partial immunomodulation. In dry eye disease, it's believed to reduce the inflammation that contributes to reduced tear production, thereby improving symptoms.  It does this by interfering with the activity of calcineurin, a protein involved in immune cell activation.

### Precautions

* **Contraindication:** Cyclosporine ophthalmic should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to cyclosporine or any component of the formulation.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Cyclosporine is categorized as pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on the developing fetus are unknown.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  While cyclosporine is excreted in breast milk after oral administration, serum levels after ophthalmic use are typically undetectable. Still, caution is advised when using it during breastfeeding.
* **General Precautions:** Always use as directed.  Avoid touching the tip of the container to any surface to prevent contamination. Remove contact lenses before application and wait 15 minutes before reinserting them.  Allow a 15-minute interval between using this medication and other eye drops. For emulsion formulations, ensure the mixture is even before use by shaking or inverting the container.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from cyclosporine ophthalmic?** A:  Improvement in dry eye symptoms may not be immediate, and it can take several weeks of regular use before noticing significant benefits.
* **Q: Can I use cyclosporine ophthalmic with other eye drops?** A:  Yes, but ideally, there should be a 15-minute interval between applications of different eye medications to prevent interactions and ensure proper absorption.
* **Q: How should I store cyclosporine ophthalmic?** A:  Store as directed on the product label. Typically, this involves storing at room temperature and away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Is cyclosporine ophthalmic safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term safety data is available. However, regular monitoring by an ophthalmologist is advisable for those using it for extended periods.
