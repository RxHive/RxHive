# Choline Theophyllinate + Salbutamol

It's important to note that a combination of choline theophyllinate and salbutamol is not a standard, commercially available formulation.  While both drugs are used to treat respiratory conditions, they are typically administered separately.  Therefore, providing details on a "generic Choline Theophyllinate + Salbutamol" is impossible as such a drug doesn't exist in widespread pharmaceutical practice.  The information below is based on the individual actions of each drug and should *not* be interpreted as a description of a combined product.  **Consult a medical professional for any respiratory issues.**


**Generic Name (Individual components):**

* **Choline Theophyllinate:** A bronchodilator.
* **Salbutamol (Albuterol):** A short-acting beta2-agonist bronchodilator.


**Usage (Individual components):**

* **Choline Theophyllinate:**  Used to treat and prevent symptoms of asthma and other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD).  It is less commonly used now compared to other bronchodilators.
