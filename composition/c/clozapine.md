# Clozapine
### Generic Name
Clozapine

### Usage
Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic primarily used to treat schizophrenia that hasn't responded to other treatments (treatment-resistant schizophrenia).  It's also used to reduce the risk of suicidal behavior in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  While not its primary indication, it may be considered in cases where other antipsychotics have proven ineffective.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage is highly individualized and requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional.  Treatment begins with a very low dose (12.5 mg once or twice daily) and is gradually increased over several weeks.  The target daily dose usually ranges from 300-450 mg, but can go as high as 900 mg in divided doses, depending on individual response and tolerability. The rate of increase is crucial; it is typically done in increments of 25-50 mg per day initially, then up to 100 mg, no more frequently than once or twice per week.  The medication is usually administered orally in tablet or orally disintegrating tablet form, sometimes in suspension.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Clozapine is not approved for use in children and adolescents due to a lack of safety and efficacy data.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments might be needed for patients with liver or kidney problems.  Individuals taking other medications, particularly those that affect liver enzymes (CYP enzymes), may also require dose adjustments to avoid adverse interactions. Consult a doctor or pharmacist for specific recommendations.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Sedation
* Increased salivation (sialorrhea)
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Weight gain
* Fatigue
* Tremor

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

* **Agranulocytosis (severe drop in white blood cells):** This is a life-threatening side effect requiring immediate medical attention.  Regular blood tests are mandatory during treatment.
* **Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle):**  Symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, and rapid heartbeat necessitate immediate medical evaluation.
* **Cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease):** Similar to myocarditis, this requires prompt medical attention.
* **Seizures:**  A risk, especially with higher doses.
* **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):** A rare but potentially fatal reaction characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
* **Orthostatic hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing):** Can lead to dizziness or fainting.
* **Tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements):**  A late-onset side effect that can be irreversible.

**Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.**


### How it Works
Clozapine's precise mechanism is not entirely understood, but it's believed to work by blocking the action of dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain.  These neurotransmitters are implicated in the symptoms of schizophrenia. By affecting these receptors, Clozapine helps to alleviate the positive (hallucinations, delusions) and negative (lack of motivation, flat affect) symptoms of this condition.

### Precautions

* **Blood monitoring:** Regular blood tests to monitor white blood cell counts are crucial throughout treatment due to the risk of agranulocytosis.
* **Cardiac monitoring:**  Due to the risk of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, cardiac evaluation might be necessary.
* **Seizure risk:**  Patients with a history of seizures are at increased risk.
* **Other medications:**  Interactions with many other drugs are possible, so it’s vital to inform your healthcare provider of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal supplements) being taken.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Clozapine should only be used during pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment.
* **Driving and operating machinery:**  Drowsiness is a common side effect, making it unsafe to operate machinery or drive until the effect is assessed.
* **Alcohol:**  Avoid alcohol consumption as it can worsen side effects.
* **Elderly patients:**  Increased risk of death has been reported in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. Clozapine is not indicated for this use.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Clozapine?**  A:  The onset of effects varies but can take several weeks to months.  Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider is vital.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Clozapine suddenly?** A: No.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms and other complications.  The dose should be reduced gradually under medical supervision.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it’s almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.
* **Q: How should I store Clozapine?** A: Store the medication as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor or pharmacist immediately.  Some side effects require prompt medical attention.
