# Choline C 11
### Generic Name
Choline C 11

### Usage
Choline C 11 is a radiopharmaceutical used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans.  Its primary use is in imaging to help detect the recurrence of prostate cancer in patients where other imaging techniques like bone scintigraphy, CT, or MRI have been non-informative.  It's specifically employed when there's suspicion of prostate cancer recurrence.  This is because increased choline uptake is associated with the rapid cell growth characteristic of some cancers.  It is not a replacement for a tissue biopsy to confirm cancer recurrence.


### Dosage
**Prostate Imaging (Adult):** The typical intravenous (IV) dose is 10-20 mCi (370-740 MBq). The exact volume administered will depend on the patient's size and the imaging equipment used.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Choline C 11 in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects
* Local injection site reactions (frequency not defined)

While serious side effects are uncommon, allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible.  Any adverse effects should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Choline C 11 is a radioactive analog of choline. Choline is a molecule needed to build the membranes of cells. Cancer cells often grow and divide rapidly, requiring more choline to build new cell membranes.  Choline C 11 accumulates in areas of high choline uptake, allowing these areas to be visualized on a PET scan.  The increased uptake of Choline C 11 in a specific area suggests increased cell proliferation, which may indicate the presence of cancerous tissue.  However, this uptake is not specific to prostate cancer; other cancers can also show increased uptake.


### Precautions
* **Concomitant Medications:** Using Choline C 11 with colchicine (a medication for gout) may interfere with imaging results.  Colchicine should be stopped for at least two weeks before the scan.  Androgen deprivation therapy (used to treat prostate cancer) can also interfere with imaging accuracy.
* **Fasting:** Patients should fast for at least six hours before the scan to minimize interference from dietary choline.
* **Hydration:**  Patients should be well-hydrated for at least four hours before the scan.
* **Voiding:** Patients should urinate after each imaging session and frequently for an hour after the completion of the PET/CT scan.
* **False Positives/Negatives:**  The results of Choline C 11 PET scans can sometimes be inaccurate.  Other diagnostic tests may be needed to confirm findings.  Conditions like tissue inflammation and prostatic hyperplasia can lead to false-positive results.  Low PSA levels (<2 ng/mL) may be associated with less reliable imaging results.
* **Other Cancers:** Choline C 11 uptake is not specific to prostate cancer and can occur in other types of cancers (e.g., lung, brain tumors).
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Choline C 11 is not recommended for use in women.  The excretion of the drug in breast milk is unknown.
* **Hypersensitivity:** There is a potential risk of allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis).
* **Radiation Safety:** Appropriate precautions should be taken for handling and disposal of Choline C 11 due to its radioactivity.

### FAQs

**Q: What is Choline C 11 used for?**
A: It is a radiotracer used in PET scans primarily to help detect recurrent prostate cancer.

**Q: Is it a cure for prostate cancer?**
A: No, it is a diagnostic imaging agent, not a treatment.

**Q: How long does the scan take?**
A: The scan itself takes a variable amount of time. The preparation (fasting, hydration) and post-scan voiding add to the total time commitment.

**Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions?**
A: Yes, fasting for at least six hours before the scan is usually required.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A: Report any side effects, especially allergic reactions, immediately to your healthcare provider.

**Q:  How is Choline C 11 administered?**
A: It's administered intravenously (IV) as a bolus injection.

**Q: Is Choline C 11 safe?**
A: Like all medications, there are potential risks and side effects.  Your doctor will assess your suitability for this scan.  Proper handling and disposal procedures minimize radiation risks.
