# Chlorhexidine gluconate (Oral)
### Generic Name
Chlorhexidine Gluconate (Oral)

### Usage

Chlorhexidine gluconate oral preparations are primarily used to treat gingivitis (gum inflammation).  It's a powerful antiseptic and disinfectant, effectively targeting the bacteria contributing to this common oral condition.  

Beyond gingivitis treatment, chlorhexidine gluconate has an off-label use in oropharyngeal decontamination. This involves reducing the risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), particularly in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.  This off-label use typically involves rinsing or swabbing the mouth with a chlorhexidine solution before and after surgery.  It's crucial to understand that this application is outside the officially approved uses and should only be implemented under strict medical supervision.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (rinse, gel) and the indication:

**Gingivitis:**

* **Oral Rinse (0.12%):**  Swish 10-15 mL of undiluted rinse in the mouth for 30-60 seconds after brushing, twice daily (morning and evening).  Spit out the rinse; do not swallow. Treatment should begin immediately after professional dental cleaning. Regular dental checkups and cleanings (every 6 months) are recommended.
* **Dental Gel (1%):** Apply approximately one inch of gel to a moistened toothbrush and brush teeth for one minute, once or twice daily. Spit out excess gel; do not rinse.


**Oropharyngeal Decontamination (Off-Label Use):**

* **Oral Rinse (0.12%):**  15 mL swished and gargled, or applied with a swab to all oral surfaces (buccal, pharyngeal, gingival, tongue, and teeth) for 30 seconds, twice daily.  This is typically initiated pre-operatively and continued post-operatively for 10 days or until extubation (removal of breathing tube). Avoid food and drink for 30 minutes after rinsing.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate oral preparations in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

Common Side Effects:

* Toothache
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Sinusitis
* Gingival hyperplasia (gum overgrowth)
* Aphthous stomatitis (mouth ulcers)
* Bronchitis
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)

Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects:

* Cellulitis (skin infection)
* Dental discoloration (with oral rinse)
* Increased tartar formation
* Mouth discoloration
* Abscess (localized infection)
* Allergic reactions (rare)


If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Chlorhexidine gluconate is a broad-spectrum antiseptic and disinfectant. It works by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane of a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria and yeast. This action leads to cell death (bactericidal effect) or inhibits their growth (bacteriostatic effect), depending on the concentration used.  By targeting the bacteria responsible for gingivitis, it helps reduce inflammation and improve gum health.  The mechanism in oropharyngeal decontamination is similar â€“ reducing the bacterial load in the mouth to prevent pneumonia.


### Precautions

* **Contraindicated:**  Chlorhexidine gluconate is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to chlorhexidine or any formulation component.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with periodontal disease or conditions that compromise the immune system (e.g., diabetes, cancer).  Use in acute periodontal abscess pockets is not recommended.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of chlorhexidine gluconate during pregnancy and breastfeeding isn't fully established. Consult your healthcare provider before using it during these periods.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Interactions:** There are no significant drug interactions listed, but informing your doctor about all medications you are taking is always recommended.
* **Specific Instructions:**  Avoid swallowing the chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse or gel.  For the rinse, avoid rinsing the mouth with water or other mouthwashes immediately after use, or before brushing your teeth. Avoid contact with eyes and ears.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from using chlorhexidine gluconate for gingivitis?**  A: Improvement in gum health may be noticed within a few days to a couple of weeks, depending on the severity of the gingivitis and adherence to the prescribed regimen.

* **Q: Can I use chlorhexidine gluconate long-term?**  A:  Long-term use is generally not recommended unless directed by a dentist or doctor due to potential side effects, such as staining of teeth and increased tartar build-up.

* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally swallow some chlorhexidine gluconate?**  A: Contact your healthcare provider or a poison control center immediately.

* **Q: Can I use chlorhexidine gluconate if I have sensitive teeth?**  A:  Some individuals with sensitive teeth may experience increased discomfort. Consult your dentist before use if you have sensitive teeth.

* **Q: How should I store chlorhexidine gluconate?**  A: Store chlorhexidine gluconate as directed on the product label. Typically this involves keeping it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat.
