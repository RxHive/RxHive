# Clemastine
### Generic Name
Clemastine

### Usage
Clemastine is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergies, such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and urticaria (hives).  It's also used to treat symptoms of the common cold, particularly those related to upper respiratory allergies.  The drug's effectiveness lies in its ability to counteract the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions.  While not its primary use, Clemastine can also offer relief from angioedema, a condition characterized by swelling of the skin and mucous membranes.

### Dosage
Clemastine dosage varies depending on the patient's age, the specific condition being treated, and the formulation (tablet or syrup).  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions carefully.  The following information is for general guidance only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.


**Adults:**

* **Allergic Rhinitis/Urticaria/Angioedema:**  The usual adult dose is 1.34 mg (equivalent to 1 mg of clemastine base) twice daily.  This may be increased as needed, but the maximum daily dose is generally 8.04 mg (6 mg base).  Some formulations may recommend single doses of 2.68 mg (2 mg base) repeated as necessary, up to a maximum of three times daily.

* **Common Cold (Over-the-Counter Use):**  The usual dose is 1.34 mg (1 mg base) twice daily, with a maximum daily dose of 2.68 mg (2 mg base).

**Children:**  Clemastine dosage for children is calculated based on weight and age and is typically lower than the adult dose.  Always consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosage instructions.  Information provided on pediatric dosage should be reviewed in consultation with a healthcare professional to ensure safe and accurate administration to children.

**Specific Instructions:**  The medication can be taken with or without food, but taking it with food may reduce gastrointestinal upset.  Liquid formulations should be measured using an accurate measuring device.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of Clemastine include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Nausea

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Difficulty urinating
* Fast heartbeat (tachycardia)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Seizures (convulsions)

If you experience any concerning side effects, discontinue use and contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Clemastine is an antihistamine that works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions. Histamine causes many of the symptoms of allergies, such as itching, sneezing, runny nose, and swelling. By blocking histamine, Clemastine reduces or prevents these symptoms.  Additionally, Clemastine possesses anticholinergic properties, meaning it also affects the activity of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in various bodily functions, contributing to its effectiveness in relieving certain allergic symptoms.


### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Clemastine is categorized as Pregnancy Category B, meaning animal studies have not shown risk to the fetus, but there are no adequate studies in pregnant women. However, it's known that small amounts are excreted in breast milk, therefore breastfeeding is generally contraindicated during Clemastine use.  Consult your doctor about the risks and benefits before taking Clemastine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Interactions:** Clemastine can interact with other medications, particularly monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Conditions to Watch:** Clemastine should be used cautiously in patients with certain conditions, such as glaucoma, enlarged prostate, bladder obstruction, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, and those with a history of seizures.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Because Clemastine can cause drowsiness, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how it affects you.
* **Older Adults and Children:** Older adults and young children may be more sensitive to the effects of Clemastine and may require lower doses.


### FAQs
