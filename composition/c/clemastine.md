# Clemastine

**Generic Name:** Clemastine fumarate

**Usage:**

Clemastine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies such as:

*   Sneezing
*   Runny nose
*   Itchy, watery eyes
*   Itching
*   Hives (urticaria)

It's also sometimes used to treat the common cold symptoms, although its effectiveness in this context is debated.  It is available in both oral (tablets, syrup) and topical (cream, lotion) formulations. The topical form is primarily for skin itching.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of clemastine include:

*   Drowsiness (this is a significant side effect; avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy)
*   Dry mouth
*   Constipation
*   Blurred vision
*   Difficulty urinating

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

*   Fast heartbeat
*   Seizures (rare, especially with overdose)
*   Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)

**How it Works:**

Clemastine is a first-generation antihistamine.  It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine causes many of the symptoms associated with allergies. By blocking histamine receptors, clemastine reduces these symptoms.
