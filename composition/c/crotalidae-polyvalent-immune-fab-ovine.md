# Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (ovine)
### Generic Name
Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (ovine)

### Usage
Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (ovine) is an antivenom specifically designed to treat bites from venomous North American snakes of the Crotalidae family. This includes rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths (water moccasins).  Its primary use is to neutralize the venom's toxic effects, thereby preventing or mitigating serious complications.  This antivenom is a critical component of emergency treatment for these snakebites.

### Dosage

**Crotalid Envenomation (Adult and Pediatric):**

* **IV Administration:** The antivenom is administered intravenously.
* **Initial Dose:**  4-6 vials (containing up to 1 gram of ovine antiserum) infused over one hour. Treatment should begin as soon as possible, ideally within 6 hours of the bite.
* **Monitoring:**  Close monitoring for one hour post-infusion is crucial to assess for allergic reactions.
* **Repeat Dosing:** If the initial dose doesn't control the envenomation (as evidenced by continued progression of local symptoms, abnormal coagulation tests, or worsening systemic signs), additional 4-6 vial doses may be given until the condition is controlled. The maximum initial dose is 12 vials.
* **Maintenance Dose:** Once envenomation is controlled, a maintenance dose of 2 vials every 6 hours may be given for up to 18 hours.  Beyond 18 hours, continued treatment depends on the patient's condition and is not guided by established dosing protocols.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Chills
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin rash
* Urticaria (hives)
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Nausea
* Fever


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (including serum sickness, anaphylactoid reactions, and anaphylaxis)
* Asthma
* Cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Wheezing
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Blood coagulation disorders (delayed or recurrent)
* Headache
* Hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)

**Important Note:**  Any adverse effects, especially those suggesting an allergic reaction, should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (ovine) contains venom-specific fragments of IgG antibodies derived from sheep. These fragments bind to and neutralize the toxins present in the venom of Crotalidae snakes.  This neutralization prevents the venom from causing further damage to tissues and organs, effectively counteracting the effects of the envenomation.  The bound venom-antibody complexes are then eliminated from the body.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This antivenom is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation (including papaya or papain) unless the benefits outweigh the risks and there's readily available management for anaphylaxis.
* **Increased Risk:** There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using in breastfeeding women.  The excretion of the antivenom in breast milk is unknown.
* **Pregnancy Category C:** This medication falls under pregnancy category C, meaning the potential benefits may outweigh the risks in some situations during pregnancy, but this should be carefully evaluated by a physician.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for the antivenom to work?** A:  The onset of action varies, but effects are usually seen within hours of administration.  Close monitoring is essential to assess the effectiveness of treatment.

* **Q: How is the antivenom stored?** A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions provided by the manufacturer on the product labeling.  Generally, antivenoms require refrigeration.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Immediately contact a healthcare professional or go to the nearest emergency room if you experience any side effects, especially those suggesting an allergic reaction (such as swelling, difficulty breathing, or widespread rash).

* **Q: Is this antivenom effective for all snake bites?** A: No, this antivenom is only effective against bites from North American Crotalidae snakes (rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths).  Other snake bites require different antivenoms.

* **Q: Can I take other medications while receiving this antivenom?** A:  It's important to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.  Some interactions are possible.
