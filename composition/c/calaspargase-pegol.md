### Generic Name
Calaspargase Pegol

### Usage
Calaspargase pegol is a medication used as part of a combination chemotherapy regimen to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and young adults aged 1 month to 21 years.  It's a crucial component of these treatment plans, not a standalone therapy.  Its primary function is to target and eliminate leukemia cells.


### Dosage

**Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL):**

* **Adults ≤ 21 years and Pediatric Patients:** The recommended dose is 2500 units/m² intravenously (IV).  This dose is administered as part of a multi-drug chemotherapy regimen and should not be given more frequently than every 21 days.

**Important Considerations:** Calaspargase pegol should *not* be interchanged with other asparaginase formulations (e.g., *E. coli* asparaginase, *Erwinia* asparaginase, or pegaspargase). Always verify the specific asparaginase product, route of administration, and dosage before administration. Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on the occurrence of side effects (see below).  Always consult prescribing information for the most up-to-date recommendations.

### How it Works

Calaspargase pegol is a pegylated form of L-asparaginase, an enzyme that breaks down the amino acid L-asparagine.  Leukemic cells often have limited ability to produce their own L-asparagine, making them dependent on an external supply. By depleting L-asparagine in the bloodstream, Calaspargase pegol starves these cancerous cells, leading to their death.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Calaspargase pegol is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) to pegylated L-asparaginase, serious thrombosis, serious pancreatitis, or serious hemorrhagic events during previous L-asparaginase therapy.  It's also contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

* **Interactions:**  Calaspargase pegol's effects may be reduced by pegloticase and may increase the effects of pegvaliase.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Calaspargase pegol can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the final dose.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose.

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with hepatic impairment.  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for renal impairment.

* **Other Precautions:**  Monitor closely for signs of pancreatitis, bleeding, liver damage, and thrombosis.  Patients with diabetes or a history of hyperglycemia should be monitored closely for blood sugar changes.
