# Calcium Lactate
### Generic Name
Calcium Lactate

### Usage
Calcium lactate is primarily used to prevent or treat hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) in individuals whose dietary calcium intake is insufficient.  This insufficiency can stem from various causes, including inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption issues, or certain medical conditions.  It's also used in the management of conditions associated with low calcium, such as:

* **Osteoporosis:** A condition characterized by weakened bones, increasing the risk of fractures. Calcium lactate can help slow bone loss and improve bone density.
* **Osteomalacia:**  Softening of the bones due to vitamin D deficiency or impaired calcium absorption. Calcium lactate supplementation is part of the treatment strategy to improve bone strength.
* **Pseudohypoparathyroidism:** A rare genetic disorder affecting the body's response to parathyroid hormone, leading to low blood calcium.  Calcium lactate helps maintain calcium levels within the normal range.
* **Hypoparathyroidism:** A condition where the parathyroid glands don't produce enough parathyroid hormone, resulting in low blood calcium. Calcium lactate plays a crucial role in managing this condition.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific condition being treated and the individual's needs.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescribed dosage.  The following are examples, not recommendations:

* **Dietary supplement:**  The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for calcium varies by age and sex. A doctor will determine the appropriate supplemental dosage based on individual needs.  One might take 252mg daily, for instance, but this varies.
* **Hypocalcemia, osteomalacia, osteoporosis:**  Typical oral dosages range from 325 to 650 mg, taken twice or three times daily before meals.
* **Hypoparathyroidism:**  A common dosage is 325 mg three times daily before meals.
* **Pseudohypoparathyroidism:** A common dosage might be 325 mg once daily before breakfast.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children depends on age, weight, and the severity of the hypocalcemia. It's expressed as elemental calcium (the actual calcium content, which is a fraction of the total weight of the calcium lactate).  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose, typically given in divided doses throughout the day. For instance, 45-65 mg/kg/day might be prescribed in four divided doses for infants and children with hypocalcemia, adjusted according to blood calcium levels.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal (kidney) function or hepatic (liver) function.  However, manufacturers' labels often lack specific guidance for these situations; therefore, close monitoring of serum calcium levels is vital to determine appropriate dosing.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Mild stomach upset


Less common, but more serious side effects, include:

* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels): Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, constipation, weakness, confusion, and kidney stones.
* Hypercalciuria (high calcium levels in urine): Can increase the risk of kidney stones.
* Milk-alkali syndrome (a rare but serious condition).

If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Calcium lactate is a salt that contains calcium, an essential mineral for various bodily functions, including bone health, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.  When taken orally, calcium lactate dissolves and releases calcium ions which are absorbed into the bloodstream. This increases the levels of calcium in the blood, addressing hypocalcemia.  In conditions like osteoporosis, increased calcium levels support bone mineralization and help reduce bone loss.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Calcium lactate is contraindicated in patients with severe hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), hypercalciuria (high calcium in urine), and those receiving certain medications like cardiac glycosides (such as digoxin). Patients with severe renal impairment should also be cautious as calcium can accumulate.
* **Drug Interactions:** Calcium lactate can interact with other medications.  For example, it can decrease the absorption of tetracyclines (a class of antibiotics) and enhance the effects of digitalis (used to treat heart conditions). Inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women:**  Calcium is excreted in breast milk; however, requirements for calcium during pregnancy and breastfeeding remain the same as in non-pregnant/non-lactating women.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage.
* **Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with kidney problems due to the potential for calcium accumulation.
* **Other Precautions:**  Individuals with a history of kidney stones should use calcium lactate with caution.  Those with sarcoidosis (a condition that affects multiple organs) should also use it cautiously.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take calcium lactate without a doctor's prescription?** A: While it's available over-the-counter as a dietary supplement in some forms, it's advisable to consult a doctor before using it, particularly for medical conditions.  A doctor can determine the appropriate dosage and monitor for side effects.

* **Q: How should I store calcium lactate?** A: Store calcium lactate at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, as directed on the product label.

* **Q: Can I take calcium lactate with other medications?** A:  Always inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose.

* **Q:  Are there different forms of calcium lactate?** A: Yes, it's available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, and sometimes in liquid solutions.  Always follow the dosage instructions provided with your specific product.
