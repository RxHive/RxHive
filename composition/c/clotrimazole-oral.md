# Clotrimazole (Oral)
### Generic Name
Clotrimazole (Oral)

### Usage
Clotrimazole oral troches are primarily used to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush), a fungal infection of the mouth and throat.  This infection is commonly caused by *Candida albicans*, a yeast-like fungus.  While primarily used for treatment, it can also be used prophylactically (preventatively) in certain high-risk individuals.  Specifically, it's used for prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients (those with weakened immune systems) undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or steroid therapy for conditions such as leukemia, solid tumors, or after renal transplantation.  It's important to note that oral clotrimazole is *not* used for systemic fungal infections; it targets only the local infection in the mouth and throat.


### Dosage

**Oropharyngeal Candidiasis (Thrush):**

* **Adults:** The usual dose is one 10 mg troche dissolved slowly in the mouth five times daily for 7-14 days.  For initial treatment in HIV-positive patients, the duration may be 7-14 days. For prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients, the dose may be reduced to three 10 mg troches daily for the duration of the immunosuppressive therapy or until steroid levels are reduced to maintenance levels.

* **Children (â‰¥3 years):** The dosage is similar to adults; one 10 mg troche dissolved slowly five times daily for 14 days.  In HIV-positive children, treatment may last 7-14 days.  Use in children under 3 years of age is generally not recommended without specific consultation with a healthcare provider.


**Important Administration Instructions:**  The troches should be allowed to dissolve slowly in the mouth; they should not be chewed or swallowed whole. Complete dissolution usually takes around 30 minutes.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with liver problems.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Abnormal liver function test results (LFTs) are the most common side effect.
* **Less Common but Important:** Pruritus (itching), nausea, and vomiting have been reported.

If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to contact a healthcare professional for advice.  Serious side effects are rare but require immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Clotrimazole is an antifungal medication that belongs to the imidazole class of drugs. It works by binding to phospholipids within the cell membrane of fungi.  This action alters the permeability of the fungal cell wall, causing leakage of essential intracellular components and ultimately leading to the death of the fungal cells.  The mechanism is highly targeted to fungal cells, minimizing adverse effects on human cells.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Clotrimazole should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to clotrimazole or any components of the formulation.

* **Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of abnormal liver function during treatment.  Caution is advised in patients with pre-existing liver impairment.

* **Drug Interactions:** Clotrimazole can interact with various medications, affecting their metabolism.  Specifically, it can increase levels of certain drugs (lomitapide, axitinib, bosutinib, eliglustat, and warfarin) and decrease the levels of others (everolimus).  Concomitant use of clotrimazole with these medications should be avoided unless specifically directed by a physician. Careful monitoring is needed when combining it with other drugs.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Clotrimazole is categorized as pregnancy category C. This means that studies in animals have shown adverse effects on the fetus, and the potential risks to the human fetus are unknown.  The excretion of clotrimazole in breast milk is unknown, but due to its low systemic absorption, the risk to the nursing infant is likely low.  However, healthcare providers should be consulted before using clotrimazole during pregnancy or breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for clotrimazole to work?** A: Improvement in symptoms is usually seen within a few days of starting treatment, but the full course of treatment (7-14 days) should be completed for optimal results.

* **Q: Can I stop taking clotrimazole if my symptoms improve?** A: No, it's crucial to complete the entire course of treatment prescribed by your healthcare provider, even if symptoms improve. Stopping early may lead to recurrence of the infection.

* **Q: How should I store clotrimazole troches?** A: Store the troches at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, as per the instructions on the product label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Is clotrimazole (oral) suitable for treating other fungal infections?** A: No, oral clotrimazole is specifically for oropharyngeal candidiasis.  It's not effective against systemic fungal infections or fungal infections in other parts of the body.
