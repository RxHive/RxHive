# Cilastatin
### Generic Name
Cilastatin

### Usage
Cilastatin is not used as a standalone medication.  Its primary use is as a *component* of combination therapy with the antibiotic imipenem.  Imipenem is a powerful antibiotic effective against a wide range of bacteria, but it's rapidly broken down by an enzyme in the kidneys called dehydropeptidase I. Cilastatin's role is to inhibit this enzyme, preventing the breakdown of imipenem and ensuring that sufficient levels of the antibiotic reach the bloodstream to effectively fight infection.  Therefore, the therapeutic application of cilastatin is entirely dependent on its use alongside imipenem to treat serious bacterial infections.

### Dosage
Cilastatin is always administered in combination with imipenem.  Dosage is determined by the specific imipenem/cilastatin product used and the severity of the infection being treated.  It's crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions meticulously.  Dosage information varies significantly depending on the formulation (e.g., powder for injection, pre-mixed solution) and the patient's age, weight, and renal function.  Consult the product's package insert or a healthcare professional for accurate dosing guidelines.  There isn't a standardized pediatric dosage independent of the imipenem dosage which is always individualized based on the patient.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of imipenem/cilastatin combination therapy (cilastatin's contribution to side effects is generally considered minor):

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Rash
* Injection site reactions (if administered intravenously)

Less common but serious side effects:

* Seizures (particularly in patients with pre-existing seizure disorders or renal impairment)
* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis)
* Pseudomembranous colitis (a severe bowel infection)
* Changes in liver function tests

**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Cilastatin works by specifically inhibiting renal dehydropeptidase I. This enzyme is located in the kidneys and is responsible for metabolizing imipenem.  By blocking the activity of this enzyme, cilastatin prevents the rapid breakdown of imipenem, allowing higher and more sustained levels of the antibiotic to circulate in the body, thus maximizing its antibacterial effectiveness.  Essentially, it acts as a "protector" for imipenem, ensuring its potency.

### Precautions
* **Renal impairment:**  Both imipenem and cilastatin are primarily excreted by the kidneys.  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with reduced kidney function to avoid accumulation and potential toxicity.
* **Central nervous system effects:**  Patients with a history of seizures or neurological disorders are at increased risk of seizures while on imipenem/cilastatin.  Close monitoring is required.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Individuals with a history of allergy to carbapenems (a class of antibiotics that includes imipenem) should not use this combination.
* **Drug interactions:**  Although cilastatin's direct interactions are limited, the combination with imipenem may interact with other medications.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Consult your doctor.
* **Older adults:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, particularly neurological ones.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can cilastatin be used alone?**  A: No, cilastatin is always used in combination with imipenem. It is not effective as a standalone medication.

* **Q: How is imipenem/cilastatin administered?** A: Typically, it is administered intravenously or intramuscularly, as directed by a physician.  Some formulations are available as a pre-mixed solution for IV infusion, while others require reconstitution prior to administration.

* **Q: How should I store imipenem/cilastatin?** A:  Store as directed by the product labeling, usually under refrigeration to maintain stability and effectiveness.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider for instructions.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions?** A: There are typically no specific dietary restrictions associated with imipenem/cilastatin, but maintaining adequate hydration is always recommended, particularly with intravenous administration.
