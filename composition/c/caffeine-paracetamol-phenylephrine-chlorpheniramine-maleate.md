# Caffeine + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Caffeine + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and allergies.  Specifically, it targets:

* **Headache:** Paracetamol addresses pain.
* **Fever:** Paracetamol reduces fever.
* **Nasal congestion:** Phenylephrine helps decongest nasal passages.
* **Runny nose/Sneezing:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate is an antihistamine that helps reduce these symptoms.
* **Fatigue:** Caffeine provides a stimulant effect to combat tiredness.

It's important to note that this is a symptomatic treatment; it does *not* cure the underlying illness.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Nervousness, restlessness, insomnia:** Primarily from caffeine and potentially phenylephrine.
* **Drowsiness, dizziness:** Primarily from chlorpheniramine maleate.
* **Dry mouth, constipation:** From antihistamine effects.
* **Nausea, vomiting:** Less common but possible.
* **Increased blood pressure, heart rate:** More likely with higher doses or pre-existing heart conditions, due to phenylephrine.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling.  Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* **Liver damage:**  Paracetamol overdose can cause serious liver damage.  Always follow dosage instructions carefully.

**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Reduces fever by affecting the area of the brain that regulates temperature.  It also provides pain relief, particularly for headaches and muscle aches.  The exact mechanism of pain relief isn't fully understood.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that works by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions. This helps reduce symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.
* **Caffeine:** A central nervous system stimulant that can increase alertness and reduce fatigue.  It can also enhance the analgesic (pain-relieving) effects of paracetamol.
