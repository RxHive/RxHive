# Calcium citrate + Vitamin D + Methylcobalamin + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Folic Acid

**Generic Name:** Calcium Citrate + Vitamin D3 + Methylcobalamin + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Folic Acid

**Usage:**  This combination is typically used as a multivitamin and mineral supplement to address deficiencies in calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin), zinc, and folate.  Specific uses may include:

* **Calcium and Vitamin D:** Supporting bone health, preventing osteoporosis, and treating or preventing hypocalcemia (low calcium levels).
* **Vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin):** Treating or preventing vitamin B12 deficiency, which can lead to anemia, nerve damage, and other neurological problems.  Methylcobalamin is a more readily bioavailable form of B12.
* **Zinc:** Supporting immune function, wound healing, and various enzymatic processes.
* **Folic Acid:**  Essential for cell growth and development, particularly important during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects.  It also plays a role in red blood cell formation.

* **Vitamin D3:**  Helps the body absorb calcium from the gut and plays a role in bone metabolism and immune function.
* **Methylcobalamin:**  A coenzyme involved in numerous metabolic processes, including the formation of red blood cells and nerve function.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:**  A vital mineral involved in immune function, wound healing, and protein synthesis.
* **Folic Acid:**  A B vitamin essential for DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell formation.
