# Calcium citrate + Vitamin D + Methylcobalamin + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Folic Acid
### Generic Name
Calcium Citrate + Vitamin D + Methylcobalamin + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Folic Acid


### Usage

This combination of nutrients is primarily used as a dietary supplement to address or prevent deficiencies in calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin), zinc, and folic acid.  Each component plays a vital role in various bodily functions:

* **Calcium Citrate:** Essential for strong bones and teeth, muscle function, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.  Calcium deficiency can lead to osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and muscle cramps.  Citrate form is often preferred for better absorption, especially in individuals with lower stomach acid.

* **Vitamin D:** Crucial for calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and cell growth.  Deficiency can result in rickets in children and osteomalacia or osteoporosis in adults.

* **Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):**  Essential for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. Deficiency can cause pernicious anemia, nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy), and cognitive impairment. Methylcobalamin is a more readily usable form of vitamin B12.

* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** Involved in numerous enzymatic processes, immune function, wound healing, and cell growth.  Deficiency can lead to impaired immune function, delayed wound healing, and growth retardation.

* **Folic Acid (Vitamin B9):** Crucial for cell growth and development, especially during pregnancy.  Essential for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia and neural tube defects in developing fetuses.


This combination is often prescribed or recommended to individuals at risk of or experiencing deficiencies in these nutrients, such as pregnant women, older adults, individuals with malabsorption syndromes, or those following restrictive diets.  It may also be used to support bone health, immune function, and overall well-being.


### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the specific formulation, individual needs, and the healthcare provider's recommendations.  There is no standardized dosage across all products.  **Always follow the directions on the product label or as prescribed by a doctor or other qualified healthcare professional.**  

The product is usually available as oral tablets or capsules.  Dosage forms and instructions will differ significantly across manufacturers.  Intravenous (IV) administration is not typical for this combination of nutrients.  Children's dosage must be determined by a pediatrician based on age, weight, and individual needs.  It's crucial to avoid self-medication and to consult a healthcare provider for personalized guidance.


### Side Effects

Generally, this nutrient combination is well-tolerated. However, some individuals may experience:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Skin rash, itching, swelling.
* **Headache**
* **Metallic taste**

Less common, but potentially serious side effects might include kidney stones (with high calcium intake), elevated calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia),  and vitamin toxicity if taken in excessive amounts.


**If you experience any adverse effects, stop taking the supplement and consult your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

This supplement works by providing the body with essential nutrients that it may be lacking. Each component plays a specific role:

* Calcium citrate is absorbed and used to build and maintain strong bones and teeth.

* Vitamin D enhances calcium absorption from the gut.

* Methylcobalamin supports nerve function and red blood cell production.

* Zinc participates in various enzymatic reactions and immune functions.

* Folic acid aids in cell growth and DNA synthesis.


By replenishing these deficiencies, the body's various functions can operate more efficiently.


### Precautions

* **Pregnant or breastfeeding women:** Consult a doctor before taking this supplement, as the dosage requirements may be different during pregnancy and lactation.  Excessive Vitamin A and D can be harmful to a developing baby.

* **Individuals with kidney stones:**  High calcium intake can worsen kidney stones. Monitor calcium levels carefully.

* **Individuals with pre-existing medical conditions:**  Consult a physician if you have conditions such as kidney disease, hypercalcemia, or other relevant health problems.
