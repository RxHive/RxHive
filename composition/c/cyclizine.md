# Cyclizine
### Generic Name
Cyclizine

### Usage
Cyclizine is primarily used to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting. Its applications span various conditions, including:

* **Motion sickness:** Cyclizine effectively combats nausea and vomiting triggered by travel via car, boat, or plane.  It's often taken prophylactically before travel.
* **Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV):** This medication helps alleviate nausea and vomiting that can occur after surgery, particularly when caused by anesthetic or analgesic drugs.
* **Vestibular disorders:** Cyclizine can help manage nausea and vomiting associated with Meniere's disease and other inner ear problems causing vertigo (a sensation of spinning).
* **Other forms of nausea and vomiting:** While not its primary indication, Cyclizine may be used to treat nausea and vomiting from other causes, though other medications might be preferred depending on the underlying condition.  A doctor's assessment is crucial here.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific condition, the patient's age, and the form of the medication (hydrochloride or lactate).  Always follow a doctor's instructions precisely.

**Adults:**

* **Motion sickness (prophylaxis and treatment):**  Intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM): 50mg of cyclizine lactate every 4-6 hours. The first dose should be taken 30 minutes before travel. Maximum daily dose: 200mg. Orally (cyclizine hydrochloride): 50mg up to three times daily. Maximum daily dose: 200mg.

### How it Works

Cyclizine is an antihistamine, specifically a piperazine derivative, that blocks histamine H1 receptors. While its exact mechanism for preventing motion sickness isn't fully understood, it's believed to act on the inner ear (labyrinthine apparatus) and a brain region involved in vomiting (chemoreceptor trigger zone). It also has a central anticholinergic effect.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cyclizine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to cyclizine or similar antihistamines; children under 6 years old; acute alcohol intoxication; asthma or COPD; urinary retention; prostatic hypertrophy; those taking CNS depressants; angle-closure glaucoma; impaired kidney or liver function; pregnancy; and severe heart or blood diseases.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with glaucoma, urinary retention, gastrointestinal obstructive disease, prostatic hypertrophy, severe heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pyloroduodenal obstruction, epilepsy, pheochromocytoma, hypertension, underlying neuromuscular disorders, hepatic impairment, and in elderly patients. Avoid alcohol and driving or operating machinery while using Cyclizine due to drowsiness.
* **Drug Interactions:** Cyclizine may enhance the sedative effects of other medications, such as barbiturates, hypnotics, opioid analgesics, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics.  It can have additive antimuscarinic effects with other anticholinergic drugs and some antidepressants. It may also mask the symptoms of ototoxicity caused by aminoglycoside antibiotics.
