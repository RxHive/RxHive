# Choline Salicylate + Tannic Acid
### Generic Name
Choline Salicylate + Tannic Acid

### Usage
Choline salicylate and tannic acid combination is primarily used topically for the symptomatic relief of minor burns, minor wounds, and other skin irritations.  Choline salicylate, a salicylate derivative, possesses anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, helping to reduce pain and swelling.  Tannic acid acts as an astringent, meaning it constricts tissues, helping to stop minor bleeding and promote the formation of a protective layer over the affected area.  This combination product aims to provide a dual action of pain relief and wound protection. It's important to note that this combination is not intended for severe burns or deep wounds; for such injuries, immediate medical attention is crucial.

### Dosage
This medication is for external use only.  Dosage is determined by the size and severity of the affected area.  Generally, a thin layer of the cream or ointment should be applied to the affected skin two to four times daily.  Avoid excessive application.  For children, adult supervision is necessary during application, and the dosage should be adjusted based on the area to be treated;  always consult a healthcare professional before using this medication on children.  There are no oral or IV formulations of this combination product.

### Side Effects
* **Common Side Effects:**  Mild burning or stinging sensation at the application site is possible, usually resolving quickly.  Skin redness or irritation may also occur in some individuals.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Allergic reactions, such as rash, hives, or difficulty breathing, are rare but possible.  If any allergic reaction occurs, discontinue use immediately and seek medical attention.  Prolonged or excessive use can potentially lead to skin dryness or irritation.

**Note:** If any side effect persists or worsens, consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works
Choline salicylate's anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, substances involved in pain and inflammation. By reducing the production of these chemicals, it effectively diminishes pain and swelling in minor injuries. Tannic acid's astringent action causes the constriction of blood vessels, reducing minor bleeding and contributing to the formation of a protective layer on the skin's surface. This protective layer assists in shielding the wound from further irritation and promotes healing. The combined action offers pain relief and wound protection.
