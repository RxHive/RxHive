It's impossible to provide complete and accurate details about a supplement containing "Coral calcium + Calcitriol + Methylcobalamin + Omega- + Vitamin K + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + L-Methyl Folate + Lycopene + Pyridoxal-" without knowing the specific dosages of each ingredient and the type of Omega fatty acids included.

Consult a doctor or qualified healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.**

However, I can offer general information about the individual components:

**Generic Name:**  There isn't a single generic name for this combination.  Each ingredient has its own generic name.

**Usage:** The intended usage would vary depending on the specific formulation and the individual needs. This combination likely aims to improve:

* **Bone health:** Coral calcium (calcium carbonate), Vitamin K, and Vitamin D (calcitriol) play crucial roles in bone metabolism.
* **Nervous system function:** Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) and Pyridoxal (vitamin B6) are essential for nerve function.  L-Methylfolate (folate) also supports nervous system health.
* **Cardiovascular health:** Omega-3 fatty acids (assuming that's what "Omega-" refers to), Lycopene, and potentially Zinc may contribute to cardiovascular health.
* **Overall health:** Zinc, folate, and the various vitamins support numerous bodily functions.
