# Coral calcium + Calcitriol + Methylcobalamin + Omega- + Vitamin K + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + L-Methyl Folate + Lycopene + Pyridoxal-

**Generic Name:** Coral Calcium + Calcitriol + Methylcobalamin + Omega-3 Fatty Acids + Vitamin K + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + L-Methylfolate + Lycopene + Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate (Note:  "Omega-" is incomplete and assumed to refer to Omega-3 Fatty Acids.  "Pyridoxal-" is incomplete and assumed to refer to Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate, the active form of Vitamin B6.)


**Usage:** This combination of nutrients is not a typical single-entity pharmaceutical drug. Instead, it represents a multi-nutrient supplement often marketed to support bone health, cardiovascular health, and overall well-being.  The individual components contribute in the following ways:

* **Coral Calcium:** A source of calcium, purported to be more easily absorbed than some other forms.  The benefits are primarily related to bone health and may help reduce the risk of osteoporosis.  However, the superior bioavailability of coral calcium compared to other calcium sources lacks conclusive scientific evidence.
* **Calcitriol (Vitamin D3):** Essential for calcium absorption and bone mineralization. It plays a crucial role in bone health, immune function, and cell growth.
* **Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):** Crucial for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. Deficiencies can lead to anemia and neurological problems.
* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:**  Essential fatty acids with anti-inflammatory properties beneficial for heart health, brain function, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases.
* **Vitamin K:**  Essential for blood clotting and bone health.  It plays a role in activating proteins necessary for bone metabolism.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:**  An essential mineral involved in numerous bodily functions, including immune function, wound healing, and cell growth.
* **L-Methylfolate (Folate):** The active form of folate, crucial for DNA synthesis, cell division, and preventing neural tube defects in pregnancy.
* **Lycopene:** A carotenoid antioxidant found in tomatoes, with potential benefits for heart health and protection against certain cancers.
* **Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate (Vitamin B6):**  The active form of vitamin B6, involved in numerous metabolic processes, including protein metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and red blood cell formation.


This combination supplement is *not* a treatment for specific diseases but rather aims to address potential nutrient deficiencies contributing to various health conditions.  It should not replace medical advice or treatment for diagnosed illnesses.


**Dosage:**  Dosage varies significantly between brands and formulations.  There is no universally accepted standard dosage for this combination.  Always follow the instructions on the specific product label and consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.  This is particularly crucial for children, pregnant women, and individuals with existing health conditions.


**Side Effects:**

* **Common:**  Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea, constipation), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels), kidney stones (especially with high calcium intake),  interactions with other medications.

**Note:**  This list is not exhaustive.  Any unusual or concerning side effects should be reported to a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:**  This supplement works by providing the body with essential nutrients that are often deficient in modern diets. Each nutrient plays a specific role in various metabolic processes and contributes to overall health and well-being.  For example, calcium and vitamin D work together to support bone health, while vitamin B12 is crucial for nerve function.  The synergistic effects of these nutrients are believed to provide broader health benefits.


**Popular Brand Names (India):**  (Specific brand names cannot be provided definitively as brand availability is dynamic and varies regionally within India.
