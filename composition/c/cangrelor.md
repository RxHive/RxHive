# Cangrelor
### Generic Name
Cangrelor

### Usage
Cangrelor is a medication used during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures.  Its primary purpose is to reduce the risk of serious complications such as heart attack (myocardial infarction), the need for repeat procedures to open blocked arteries (repeat coronary revascularization), and blood clot formation in the stent (stent thrombosis) in patients undergoing PCI.  This is particularly relevant for patients who haven't received a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor before the procedure or are not using a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.  While its primary use is during PCI, it's also sometimes used off-label as bridging therapy before cardiac surgery in specific situations to manage the risk of blood clots after stopping certain antiplatelet medications.


### Dosage

**Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI):**

* **Intravenous (IV):** A 30 mcg/kg bolus is given before the start of the PCI, immediately followed by a continuous infusion of 4 mcg/kg/min. This infusion continues for at least two hours or for the duration of the PCI, whichever is longer.

**Bridging Therapy Before Cardiac Surgery (Off-Label Use):**

* **Intravenous (IV):** A continuous infusion of 0.75 mcg/kg/min is administered, *without* a bolus dose, after discontinuing thienopyridine medications.  This infusion lasts up to 7 days before surgery. The infusion should be stopped 1-6 hours before the surgical incision, depending on the individual patient's risk of thrombotic complications after the antiplatelet medication is stopped.  Because Cangrelor has a very short half-life (3-6 minutes), minimizing the time between stopping the infusion and starting surgery is critical for high-risk patients.


**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with impaired liver or kidney function.

**Transitioning to Oral P2Y12 Antagonists:**  After the Cangrelor infusion is stopped, the transition to another antiplatelet medication should follow these guidelines:

* **Clopidogrel:**  A 600 mg dose is given immediately after stopping Cangrelor. Do *not* give clopidogrel before stopping Cangrelor.
* **Prasugrel:** A 60 mg dose is given immediately after stopping Cangrelor. Do *not* give prasugrel before stopping Cangrelor.
* **Ticagrelor:** A 180 mg dose can be given at any time during the Cangrelor infusion or immediately after it is stopped.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Cangrelor in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Hemorrhage (bleeding)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Renal insufficiency (kidney problems)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions, including potentially severe ones like anaphylaxis)


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Cangrelor is a direct P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibitor.  Platelets are blood cells essential for blood clotting.  ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is a molecule that activates platelets, causing them to clump together (aggregate) and form blood clots. Cangrelor works by binding to the P2Y12 receptor on platelets, preventing ADP from activating them. By blocking this activation, Cangrelor reduces the likelihood of unwanted blood clot formation during and after PCI.  Its effects are reversible; once the infusion stops, the effects wear off relatively quickly.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Cangrelor is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis) to Cangrelor or its components, and those with significant active bleeding.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of bleeding and hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, bronchospasm, angioedema, and stridor) with Cangrelor use.

**Use with Caution:** Cangrelor should be used cautiously in pregnant and breastfeeding women.

**Drug Interactions:** Cangrelor can reduce the effectiveness of clopidogrel and prasugrel.  It should not be administered with either of these until the Cangrelor infusion is completed. It can also increase the effects of other antiplatelet medications and anticoagulants (blood thinners).

### FAQs

**Q: How is Cangrelor administered?**
A: Cangrelor is given intravenously (IV).  For PCI, it involves a bolus followed by a continuous infusion.


**Q: How long does it take for Cangrelor to work?**
A: The effects are relatively rapid, starting soon after the bolus dose and continuous infusion begin.


**Q: How long does Cangrelor stay in the body?**
A: Cangrelor has a short half-life (3-6 minutes).  The effects wear off quickly once the infusion stops.


**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects, especially bleeding or allergic reactions.


**Q: How is Cangrelor stored?**
A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions on the product label.


**Q: Is Cangrelor suitable for everyone undergoing PCI?**
A: No.  It's primarily used in specific PCI patient populations, as noted in the Usage section.  Your physician will determine its appropriateness for your situation.
