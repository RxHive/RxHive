# Calcitriol + Calcium Citrate Malate + Vitamin K
### Generic Name
Calcitriol + Calcium Citrate Malate + Vitamin K


This combination product isn't typically found as a single, pre-mixed generic medication.  Calcitriol, Calcium Citrate Malate, and Vitamin K are often prescribed individually or in different combinations depending on a patient's specific needs.  The information below details each component and how they might be used together.  It's crucial to remember this information is for general understanding and should not be substituted for advice from a healthcare professional.  Always follow your doctor's prescription and instructions.


### Usage

**Calcitriol:** This is the active form of vitamin D3.  Its primary use is in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It helps regulate calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood, which are often disrupted in CKD.  Calcitriol can also be used to treat hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) in certain situations, although other calcium supplements are usually preferred first.

**Calcium Citrate Malate:** This is a calcium supplement used to treat or prevent hypocalcemia. It's a readily absorbable form of calcium, making it suitable for individuals with various digestive issues. Calcium is crucial for strong bones, muscle function, and nerve transmission.

**Vitamin K (Phytonadione):**  Primarily used to treat or prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding.  It's vital for blood clotting.  While less common, some individuals may be prescribed it for other reasons based on specific needs, always under the supervision of their healthcare provider.


These three components are sometimes used together in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) where there are abnormalities in calcium and bone metabolism.  The combination aims to improve calcium levels, reduce parathyroid hormone levels, and support bone health.


### Dosage

Dosage of each component varies greatly based on individual need, age, and the specific medical condition. There is no standardized "Calcitriol + Calcium Citrate Malate + Vitamin K" combination dosage since it's not a pre-mixed product.  A physician will prescribe each medication individually at the appropriate dose.  Always refer to the specific prescription and consult with your pharmacist or doctor for clarification.  Dosage forms for each include:

* **Calcitriol:** Oral capsules or solution

### How it Works

* **Calcitriol:**  Binds to receptors in the intestines, bones, and kidneys, increasing calcium absorption from the gut and reducing calcium excretion by the kidneys.  It also helps regulate parathyroid hormone, a hormone that controls calcium levels.

* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** Provides readily absorbable calcium, which is then utilized by the body for various functions, including bone health and muscle contraction.

* **Vitamin K:**  Essential for the synthesis of clotting factors in the liver, enabling proper blood clotting.


### Precautions

* **Calcitriol:**  Regular blood tests to monitor calcium and phosphorus levels are necessary.  Individuals with a history of kidney stones or high calcium levels should use caution.

* **Calcium Citrate Malate:**  High doses can lead to hypercalcemia and kidney stones. Individuals with kidney disease require careful monitoring.

* **Vitamin K:**  Individuals on anticoagulant medications (blood thinners) need to exercise extreme caution as it can interfere with their effectiveness.
