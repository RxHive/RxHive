# Clobetasol + Gentamicin + Clioquinol Iodochlorhydroxyquin + Ketoconazole
### Generic Name

Clobetasol Propionate + Gentamicin Sulfate + Clioquinol + Ketoconazole


**Note:**  This combination is not a standard, pre-mixed generic medication found in all markets.  The combination of these four active ingredients (a corticosteroid, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, an antifungal, and another antifungal) is sometimes compounded by pharmacists based on a doctor's prescription to treat specific complex skin infections.  Information below reflects the individual actions of each component and their potential combined effects; however, *always consult a compounding pharmacist or your physician for specific dosage, usage, and safety information related to any compounded medication.*  The information provided here should not substitute for professional medical advice.

### Usage

This combination medication is typically used to treat skin infections involving multiple pathogens.  It addresses infections with:

* **Bacteria:** Gentamicin sulfate targets a wide range of Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria commonly causing skin infections.
* **Fungi:** Both ketoconazole and clioquinol (iodochlorhydroxyquin) are antifungal agents effective against various dermatophytes (fungi causing skin infections like ringworm and athlete's foot) and yeasts.
* **Inflammation:** Clobetasol propionate is a potent corticosteroid that significantly reduces inflammation and itching associated with skin infections and allergic reactions.

This combination is usually reserved for severe or complex skin infections involving bacteria and fungi simultaneously where a single-agent therapy is inadequate.  It's crucial to note that this is not a first-line treatment for most skin infections.

### Dosage

There is no standard dosage for this compounded medication.  The specific amount and application frequency (e.g., twice daily, once daily) will be determined by a physician or compounding pharmacist based on the severity and extent of the infection, the patient's age, weight, and overall health.  The preparation is typically applied topically (directly to the affected skin area).  Oral or IV administration is not applicable for this compounded formulation.  A thin layer is usually sufficient.  

**Crucially:**  Information on pediatric use must come directly from the prescribing physician or compounding pharmacist.


### Side Effects

Because this is a combination of multiple potent drugs, the potential for side effects is increased compared to single-agent therapies. Common side effects may include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, stinging, redness, dryness, peeling
* **Thinning of the skin:** (Especially with prolonged clobetasol use)
* **Stretch marks (striae):**  (Especially with prolonged clobetasol use)
* **Increased skin sensitivity:** To sunlight
* **Acne:**
* **Itching:** (Paradoxically, despite the anti-inflammatory action, this can initially worsen before improvement).

Less common, but serious side effects can include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Rashes, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing (seek immediate medical attention)
* **Systemic absorption of corticosteroids:** (With extensive use or damaged skin barrier) leading to symptoms like increased blood sugar, weight gain, and other hormonal imbalances.
* **Hearing loss:** (A rare but serious side effect of gentamicin, usually associated with systemic use but theoretically possible with extensive topical application)
* **Neurotoxicity:** (Rare but potentially serious side effect of clioquinol, usually related to systemic use, but a theoretical risk)


If any adverse effects occur, contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

This combination medication acts through the combined mechanisms of its individual components:

* **Clobetasol Propionate:**  Reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune system locally in the skin.
* **Gentamicin Sulfate:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.
* **Clioquinol & Ketoconazole:**  Interfere with the fungal cell membrane synthesis, causing fungal cell death.


By combining these actions, the medication aims to control both the infection and the inflammatory response in the affected skin.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Use only if specifically prescribed by a doctor, weighing potential benefits against risks.
* **Children:**  Use should be under strict medical supervision due to increased risk of systemic absorption and side effects.
* **Liver and kidney disease:**  Caution is advised because gentamicin and clioquinol are partially metabolized and excreted by the kidneys and liver.
* **Drug interactions:**  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking, as interactions are possible, particularly with other corticosteroids or aminoglycoside antibiotics.
* **Do not use on open wounds or damaged skin:**  Unless explicitly instructed by a doctor.
* **Avoid prolonged use:**  The prolonged use of topical corticosteroids can lead to skin thinning and other adverse effects.
* **Do not cover treated areas with airtight dressings:**  Unless instructed to do so by a doctor.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use this on my face?**  A:  Usually not recommended due to the risk of skin thinning and irritation.  Use only as directed by your doctor.
* **Q: How long should I use this medication?**  A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the infection; follow your doctor's instructions.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist, usually at room temperature away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Can I stop using this medication as soon as I feel better?** A: No, continue as directed by your doctor to prevent the infection from returning.
