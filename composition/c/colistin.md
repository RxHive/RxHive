# Colistin
### Generic Name
Colistin

### Usage

Colistin, specifically colistimethate sodium (the most common form used clinically), is a polymyxin antibiotic used to treat serious infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, particularly those resistant to other antibiotics.  Its primary use is in treating infections caused by multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) like *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Acinetobacter* species.  These bacteria often cause infections such as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and bloodstream infections.

While not its primary indication, Colistin is also sometimes used off-label in other situations, including treating certain types of lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients (bronchiectasis) or as an adjunct therapy for meningitis or ventriculitis (infections of the brain and spinal cord).  The use of Colistin in these situations is often guided by the specific patient's condition and the availability of other treatment options.  It's crucial to understand that off-label use should always be under the strict supervision of a physician.

### Dosage

Colistin dosage is complex and must be carefully determined by a physician based on several factors, including the patient's age, weight, kidney function, and the severity of the infection. Dosage is typically expressed in milligrams of Colistin base activity (CBA), not the weight of the colistimethate sodium salt itself.  These are not interchangeable values.

**Adult Dosage (examples, not a complete guide):**  Dosage varies widely depending on the route of administration and the specific infection being treated.

* **Severe Infections (IV):** A loading dose might be given, followed by divided doses daily. The exact amounts (e.g., 300mg CBA loading dose followed by 300-360 mg CBA/day) are determined individually.

* **Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia/VAP (IV & Inhalation):** May involve a combination of intravenous and inhaled Colistin. Intravenous doses are similar to those mentioned above, while inhaled doses might be 150mg CBA every 8 hours via nebulizer.

* **Bronchiectasis (Inhalation):**  Typically involves nebulized doses ranging from 30 to 150 mg CBA, one to two times daily.

* **Meningitis/Ventriculitis (Intrathecal/Intraventricular):** This route is rarely used and requires a preservative-free formulation. Dosages are extremely low and highly individualized.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Pediatric dosing is also weight-based and highly individualized.  It involves calculating the dose in mg CBA/kg/day, divided into multiple doses.  Specific regimens for various infection types (e.g., pulmonary infections, CNS infections) require consultation with a medical professional.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage must be adjusted based on kidney function (creatinine clearance, CrCl).  Lower doses are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function to minimize the risk of side effects.  Dialysis patients require specific dosage adjustments.  Consult medical literature or a nephrologist for precise adjustments.

**Important Note:** The information provided above is a simplified overview.  The actual dosage regimen should always be determined and monitored by a healthcare professional.

### Side Effects

Colistin can cause a range of side effects, some common, and others rare but serious.  It is crucial to report any unusual symptoms to a doctor immediately.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) – This is the most significant risk associated with Colistin.
* Neurotoxicity (nervous system effects) – can include dizziness, numbness, tingling, seizures, etc.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Acute kidney failure
* Respiratory distress
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* *Clostridioides difficile* infection (C. diff) – a serious gut infection.


### How it Works

Colistin works by disrupting the cell membranes of bacteria.  Colistimethate, the commonly used form, is a prodrug; it's converted to the active form, Colistin, in the body. Colistin acts as a cationic detergent, attaching to the negatively charged lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.  This binding disrupts the membrane's structure, causing leakage of essential cell contents and ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Colistin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Colistin or any components of the formulation.

* **Drug Interactions:** Colistin can interact with other medications, potentially affecting their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  It's crucial to inform your physician of all medications you are taking. Specific interactions involve aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, and neuromuscular blocking agents.

* **Renal Impairment:**  Colistin is nephrotoxic, meaning it can damage the kidneys.  Patients with pre-existing kidney problems are at increased risk and require careful monitoring and potentially lower doses.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Colistin is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its safety in pregnancy has not been fully established.  It's excreted in breast milk, and use during breastfeeding should be carefully considered.

* **Neurotoxicity:**  Colistin can also affect the nervous system, particularly in patients with pre-existing neurological conditions or those receiving high doses.

* **Other Precautions:** Monitor for signs of kidney damage (e.g., decreased urine output, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), increased creatinine levels).  Regular monitoring of kidney function is crucial, especially during prolonged treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Colistin administered?**
    * A: Colistin can be administered intravenously (IV), intramuscularly (IM), or via inhalation (nebulization).  The route depends on the infection and patient's condition.  Intrathecal/intraventricular administration is very rare and only used in specific cases under strict medical supervision.

* **Q: How long will I be on Colistin?**
    * A: The duration of treatment varies significantly depending on the infection's severity and response to therapy. This is determined by a physician and may range from a few days to several weeks.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**
    * A:  Report any side effects, especially those listed above, to your doctor immediately.  Some side effects can be serious and require prompt medical attention.

* **Q: Can I take other medications with Colistin?**
    * A:  Always inform your physician of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are using to avoid potential drug interactions.

* **Q: How should I store Colistin?**
    * A: Store Colistin as directed by your pharmacist or physician.  The storage conditions vary depending on the specific formulation.
