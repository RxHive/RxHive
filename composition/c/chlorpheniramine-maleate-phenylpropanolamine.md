# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylpropanolamine
### Generic Name
Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylpropanolamine


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold and other upper respiratory allergies.  Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that works to reduce allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes. Phenylpropanolamine is a decongestant that helps to relieve stuffiness in the nose and sinuses by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages.  While primarily used for cold and allergy symptoms, it's crucial to remember this combination is not a cure for these conditions; it simply manages the symptoms.  It's generally not recommended for long-term use.


### Dosage

Dosage information should always be obtained from a healthcare professional or by carefully reading the medication label.  Dosage varies depending on the specific product formulation (e.g., tablet, capsule, liquid), the age and weight of the patient, and the severity of symptoms.  **Never administer this medication to a child or adult without consulting a doctor or pharmacist.**  

* **Adults:** The typical adult dose is usually specified on the product label.  Self-medication should be approached with caution, and exceeding the recommended dose can lead to adverse effects.
* **Children:**  This combination medication is generally not recommended for use in children without explicit direction from a physician.  Many formulations specifically exclude children due to the potential for adverse effects.  If prescribed for a child, the dosage will be carefully determined by a pediatrician based on the child's weight and age.
* **Oral Administration:** This medication is typically administered orally, as directed on the product label or by a healthcare professional.
* **IV Administration:** This combination is not intended for intravenous administration.

### How it Works

Chlorpheniramine maleate, an antihistamine, blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine is responsible for many allergy symptoms. By blocking histamine, chlorpheniramine reduces symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes.

Phenylpropanolamine, a decongestant, works by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages. This reduces swelling and congestion, making it easier to breathe.
