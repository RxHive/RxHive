# Clobetasol + Gentamicin

**Generic Name:** Clobetasol Propionate + Gentamicin Sulfate

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid (clobetasol propionate) and an aminoglycoside antibiotic (gentamicin sulfate). It's used to treat inflammatory skin conditions with a secondary bacterial infection.  Examples include:

* **Eczema (dermatitis) with infection:**  It helps reduce inflammation and itching associated with eczema while combating bacterial infection.
* **Psoriasis with infection:** Similar to eczema, it targets both inflammation and bacterial infection in psoriasis plaques.
* **Other inflammatory skin conditions with infection:**  It may be used for other conditions like contact dermatitis or other skin infections where inflammation and bacterial involvement are present.

**Important Note:** This medication is generally used for a short period (1-2 weeks) due to the potent corticosteroid component.  Long-term use should be avoided.  It is crucial to follow a doctor's instructions precisely.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the duration and area of application.  Common side effects include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, redness at the application site.
* **Skin thinning (atrophy):**  Prolonged use can thin the skin, making it more susceptible to damage.
* **Striae (stretch marks):** Especially with prolonged use.
* **Telangiectasia (small dilated blood vessels):** Can appear as tiny red lines on the skin.
* **Acne:** Worsening of pre-existing acne or development of new acne.
* **Hypopigmentation (loss of skin color):** May occur with prolonged use.
* **Hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth):** In some cases.
* **Allergic contact dermatitis:**  Rare but possible.

**Systemic side effects (less common but more serious, especially with extensive application or prolonged use):**

* **Cushing's syndrome:**  A hormonal disorder.
* **Adrenal suppression:**  The adrenal glands produce less cortisol.
* **Increased blood glucose levels:** Especially in patients with diabetes.
* **Gentamicin-related side effects:**  These are less frequent with topical application but can include kidney problems (rare).

**How it Works:**

* **Clobetasol Propionate:** This is a potent corticosteroid. It works by reducing inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response in the skin.
* **Gentamicin Sulfate:** This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It works by killing bacteria that may be causing or contributing to the skin infection.  The combination addresses both the inflammatory and infectious components of the skin condition.
