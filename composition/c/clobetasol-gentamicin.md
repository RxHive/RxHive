# Clobetasol + Gentamicin
### Generic Name
Clobetasol Propionate + Gentamicin Sulfate


### Usage

Clobetasol Propionate + Gentamicin Sulfate is a combination topical medication used to treat inflammatory skin conditions that are complicated by bacterial infection.  Clobetasol propionate is a potent corticosteroid that reduces inflammation, itching, and redness. Gentamicin sulfate is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that combats bacterial infection.  This combination is primarily used for conditions like:

* **Eczema (with secondary infection):**  When eczema flares up and becomes infected with bacteria.
* **Psoriasis (with secondary infection):**  Similar to eczema, psoriasis can become infected, and this combination can help manage both inflammation and infection.
* **Dermatitis (with secondary infection):** Various types of dermatitis, such as contact dermatitis or atopic dermatitis, can be complicated by bacterial infection, making this combination therapy relevant.
* **Other inflammatory skin conditions with bacterial infection:** The specific condition will be determined by a healthcare professional.


It's crucial to understand that this medication treats the *symptoms* of the skin condition and the bacterial infection. It does not address the underlying cause of the skin condition itself.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will be provided by your healthcare professional and will vary depending on the specific condition, severity, affected area, and patient factors.  Generally, a thin film of the cream or ointment is applied to the affected area twice daily, or as directed by a doctor.  

* **Adults:** The usual application is twice daily.  The duration of treatment should not exceed two weeks, and often is much shorter.
* **Children:** Use in children should be under strict medical supervision due to the potent corticosteroid. The duration and frequency of application will be determined by a healthcare professional based on the child’s age, weight, and specific condition.
* **Oral and IV Administration:** This medication is for topical use only and is not available for oral or intravenous administration.


**Important:** Always follow your doctor’s instructions precisely. Do not exceed the recommended dosage or duration of treatment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Skin thinning (atrophy)
* Stretch marks (striae)
* Increased skin sensitivity
* Acne-like rash
* Itching or irritation

Less common, but serious side effects:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)
* Skin discoloration
* Worsening of the infection
* Systemic absorption of the steroid (with prolonged use or application to large areas):  This can lead to symptoms like Cushing's syndrome (though unlikely with topical use).


If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Clobetasol propionate, the corticosteroid component, reduces inflammation by suppressing the activity of inflammatory cells in the skin. It decreases redness, swelling, itching, and discomfort.  Gentamicin sulfate, the antibiotic component, kills bacteria by interfering with their protein synthesis, thus preventing their growth and spread.  The combination effectively addresses both the inflammatory and infectious components of the skin condition.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used if you are allergic to clobetasol propionate, gentamicin sulfate, or any other component of the preparation.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, and herbal supplements.  Some medications can interact with clobetasol propionate or gentamicin sulfate.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be under strict medical supervision.  The potential benefits must outweigh the potential risks to the mother and child.
* **Children:** Use in children should be limited to short courses and under strict medical supervision due to the risk of systemic absorption of the steroid.
* **Elderly:**  The elderly may be more susceptible to side effects.
* **Large areas or occlusive dressings:** Applying this medication to large skin areas or under occlusive dressings (e.g., bandages) should be avoided unless specifically instructed by a doctor, due to increased risk of systemic absorption.
* **Infected wounds:**  While this medication is used for infected skin conditions, it's important that a proper diagnosis of the infection is made.  This cream is not suitable for all types of bacterial infections.  Your doctor should assess whether this is the right treatment for your specific infection.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I use this cream?** A:  The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and generally should not exceed two weeks.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.
* **Q: Can I use this cream on my face?** A: Use on the face should be avoided unless specifically instructed by your doctor because the face is more susceptible to skin thinning and other side effects from topical corticosteroids.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the medication as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Is it okay to use this cream under a bandage?** A: Only use this medication under a bandage if specifically instructed by your doctor.  Using it this way increases the risk of systemic absorption.
