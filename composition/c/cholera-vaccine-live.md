# Cholera Vaccine (Live)
### Generic Name
Cholera Vaccine (Live)

### Usage
Cholera vaccine (live) is used to actively immunize individuals aged 2 to 64 years against cholera caused by *Vibrio cholerae* serogroup O1.  It's primarily intended for people traveling to areas where cholera is prevalent, acting as a preventative measure.  The vaccine is not intended for use in individuals already living in cholera-affected regions or those with pre-existing immunity.  It also does not protect against cholera caused by *V. cholerae* serogroup O139 or other non-O1 serogroups.

### Dosage
**Adults (2-64 years):**  A single oral dose of 100 mL is recommended.  This dose should be administered at least 10 days before potential exposure to cholera.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of this vaccine have not been established in children.  Therefore, it is not recommended for use in pediatric populations.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are specified in the manufacturer's labeling for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
The most common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of recipients) include:

*   Fatigue
*   Headache
*   Abdominal pain
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting

Less common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of recipients) include diarrhea.

Serious side effects, while less frequent, include anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions.  Seek immediate medical attention if any serious adverse reactions occur.

### How it Works
The cholera vaccine (live) contains live, attenuated (weakened) *Vibrio cholerae* bacteria. When administered orally, these bacteria replicate in the gastrointestinal tract, stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the bacteria. This process creates immunity against cholera.  The precise immune mechanisms involved in providing protection are not fully understood.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  This vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the vaccine, any previous dose of a cholera vaccine, or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings and Precautions:** There's an increased risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions.  The vaccine bacteria can be shed in stool for at least seven days following vaccination, potentially leading to transmission.  Caution is advised when considering use in individuals in close contact with immunocompromised people.  

**Drug Interactions:**
*   Immunoglobulins may reduce the vaccine's effectiveness; concurrent use is not recommended.
*   Immunosuppressant treatments (e.g., antineoplastics, corticosteroids at therapeutic doses) can reduce the vaccine's response; concurrent use is not recommended.
*   Oral, encapsulated typhoid vaccine should not be given within 8 hours of the cholera vaccine.
*   Systemic antibiotics (should be stopped 14 days before vaccination) can interfere with the vaccine's live bacteria.
*   Chloroquine prophylaxis may reduce the vaccine's effectiveness; administer the vaccine 10 days before chloroquine.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of this vaccine during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.  Use with caution during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take for the vaccine to become effective?**  A: The vaccine should be administered at least 10 days before potential exposure to cholera to allow sufficient time for the immune response to develop.

*   **Q: How is the vaccine stored?** A: Storage requirements vary depending on the vaccine formulation.  Frozen formulations must be stored at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F), while refrigerated formulations should be kept at 2-8°C (36-46°F).  Always follow the specific storage instructions provided with your vaccine.

*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects are common.  For severe or concerning side effects, seek medical attention immediately.

*   **Q: Does this vaccine protect against all types of cholera?** A: No, this vaccine only protects against cholera caused by *Vibrio cholerae* serogroup O1.  It does not protect against other serogroups, including O139.

*   **Q:  Can I receive other vaccines at the same time?** A:  Consult your healthcare provider about simultaneous administration of other vaccines.  The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends simultaneous administration of age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) when feasible, unless contraindications exist.  Live vaccines should be administered at least 4 weeks before planned immunosuppression and avoided within 2 weeks of immunosuppression.
