# Clobetasol + Clotrimazole + Gentamicin

**Generic Name:** Clobetasol propionate + clotrimazole + gentamicin

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid, antifungal, and antibiotic used to treat skin infections that involve all three types of organisms:

* **Fungal infections:** Caused by fungi like *Candida* (e.g., yeast infections).  Clotrimazole targets these.
* **Bacterial infections:**  Caused by bacteria susceptible to gentamicin.
* **Inflammation:**  Clobetasol propionate, a potent corticosteroid, reduces inflammation and itching associated with the infection.

It's typically prescribed for conditions like:

*  Fungal infections complicated by secondary bacterial infection.
*  Infections of skin folds (intertrigo) with a mix of fungi and bacteria.
*  Severe eczema or dermatitis with superimposed bacterial and fungal infections.


**Side Effects:**  Because this is a combination of potent medications, side effects can be significant and depend on the duration and area of application.  They can include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, redness.
* **Skin thinning (atrophy):** Prolonged use, especially on sensitive areas like the face, can lead to thinning of the skin.
* **Striae (stretch marks):**  May appear on the skin.
* **Telangiectasia (spider veins):** Thin, dilated blood vessels may become visible.
* **Purpura:**  Bruising.
* **Hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation:** Darkening or lightening of the skin.
* **Secondary infection:** Although this medication treats bacterial infections, prolonged use or improper application can increase the risk of other bacterial or fungal infections.
* **Absorption and systemic effects:** While primarily topical, prolonged or extensive use can lead to systemic absorption of the drugs, resulting in side effects affecting other parts of the body.  This is particularly concerning with clobetasol propionate.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, hives, swelling.

**How it Works:**

* **Clobetasol propionate:**  A potent corticosteroid that reduces inflammation by suppressing the immune system response. This reduces itching, redness, and swelling.
* **Clotrimazole:** An antifungal agent that kills fungi by interfering with their cell membranes.
* **Gentamicin:** An aminoglycoside antibiotic that kills bacteria by disrupting their protein synthesis.

The combination addresses the fungal, bacterial, and inflammatory components of the skin infection simultaneously.
