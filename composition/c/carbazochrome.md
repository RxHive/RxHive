# Carbazochrome
### Generic Name
Carbazochrome

### Usage
Carbazochrome is a hemostatic agent, meaning it helps to stop bleeding.  Historically, it was used in various surgical procedures to reduce bleeding and oozing, including tonsillectomies, adenoidectomies, prostatic surgeries, dental procedures, and to manage retinal hemorrhage and nosebleeds.  It was primarily used to address capillary bleedingâ€”bleeding from the smallest blood vessels.  However, it's crucial to understand that carbazochrome is no longer available in the United States for clinical use due to a lack of conclusive evidence supporting its effectiveness.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Historical):**

* **Bleeding prophylaxis (prevention):**
    * **Preoperative:** 10 mg intramuscularly (IM) the night before surgery and another 10 mg IM on-call, just before the procedure.
    * **Postoperative:** If preoperative carbazochrome was administered, 5 mg every 2 hours IM or orally, as needed. If no preoperative dose was given, 10 mg every 2 hours IM or orally, as needed.

**Pediatric Dosage (Historical):**

* **Bleeding prophylaxis:**
    * **Preoperative:** 5 mg IM the night before surgery and 5 mg IM 1/2 hour before surgery.  For adenotonsillectomy, a similar regimen was used.
    * **Postoperative:** For children under 12, 5 mg every 2 hours IM or orally, as needed. For children over 12, the adult dose was used.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling did not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects
* Gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Pain or stinging sensation at the injection site

Serious side effects were not specifically documented in readily available information.  Any unusual or concerning side effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Carbazochrome's mechanism of action involves decreasing the excessive permeability (leakiness) of capillaries.  This reduces bleeding by strengthening the capillary walls and making them less likely to leak blood.  The exact mechanism is not fully elucidated but is believed to involve influencing the body's clotting process indirectly.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Carbazochrome is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to carbazochrome or salicylates (a class of drugs including aspirin).  It is also contraindicated for intravenous (IV) injection.

* **Warnings:** There is an increased risk of injection-site pain.  

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of carbazochrome during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  Use with caution is advised in these populations.

* **General Considerations:** Carbazochrome should only be administered intramuscularly or orally; intravenous administration is strictly prohibited.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is carbazochrome still used today?** A: No, carbazochrome is no longer available in the US for clinical use due to insufficient evidence of its effectiveness.

* **Q: What are the alternatives to carbazochrome for managing bleeding?** A: Several other medications and techniques are available to manage and prevent bleeding, including other hemostatic agents, cautery (burning of blood vessels), and surgical techniques to control bleeding at its source.  A healthcare professional can advise on the most appropriate treatment.

* **Q: How should carbazochrome be stored?** A:  Information on specific storage requirements is unavailable in readily accessible resources because the drug is no longer available in the US.
