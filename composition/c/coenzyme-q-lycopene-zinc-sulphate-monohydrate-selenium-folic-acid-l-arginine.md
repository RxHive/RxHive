It's crucial to understand that I cannot provide medical advice.  The information below is for general knowledge and informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.  Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.

**Generic Name:**  This product doesn't have a single generic name as it's a combination of several different ingredients.  We can list them individually:

* Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone)
* Lycopene
* Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate
* Selenium (often as Selenomethionine or Sodium Selenite)
* Folic Acid (Vitamin B9)
* L-Arginine


**Usage:**  The intended usage varies greatly depending on the manufacturer's formulation and target market.  Common uses suggested for the individual components include:

* **Coenzyme Q10:** Energy production, cardiovascular health, antioxidant support.
* **Lycopene:** Antioxidant, potential benefits for prostate health and cardiovascular health.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** Immune support, wound healing, cell growth and division.
* **Selenium:** Antioxidant, thyroid hormone metabolism, immune function.
* **Folic Acid:**  Cell growth and division, crucial for pregnant women and preventing neural tube defects.
* **L-Arginine:** Precursor to nitric oxide, potentially improving blood flow and cardiovascular health.


A combined supplement might be marketed for improved cardiovascular health, immune support, or general antioxidant protection.  The specific dosages of each ingredient will greatly influence the intended usage.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects vary depending on the individual ingredient and dosage.  Generally, side effects are considered mild but can include:

* **Folic Acid:** Generally safe, but high doses may mask vitamin B12 deficiency.
* **L-Arginine:**  Digestive upset, headache, allergic reactions in rare cases.  May interact with certain medications.


**How it Works:** Each ingredient works through different mechanisms:

* **Coenzyme Q10:** Acts as an electron carrier in the mitochondria, essential for energy production.  Also possesses antioxidant properties.
* **Lycopene:** A potent carotenoid antioxidant that scavenges free radicals.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:**  Involved in numerous enzymatic processes and plays a crucial role in immune function.
* **Selenium:**  Part of glutathione peroxidase, an important antioxidant enzyme.
* **Folic Acid:**  Essential coenzyme in many metabolic pathways, particularly DNA synthesis.
* **L-Arginine:**  Converted to nitric oxide, a vasodilator that helps relax blood vessels.


The combined effect of these ingredients is synergistic, meaning that their combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects. However, the exact synergistic interactions are complex and not fully understood.
