# Clindamycin
### Generic Name
Clindamycin

### Usage
Clindamycin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections.  Its primary use is against a wide range of susceptible bacteria, making it effective for various infections.  These include skin and skin structure infections (like abscesses, cellulitis, and wound infections), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and certain types of pneumonia. It's also sometimes used to treat bone and joint infections, endocarditis (infection of the heart lining), and bacteremia (bacteria in the bloodstream).  While effective in many cases, its use is guided by culture and sensitivity testing to ensure the infecting bacteria are susceptible to clindamycin.  The choice to use clindamycin will often depend on the specific bacteria involved and the patient's overall health.


### Dosage
Clindamycin dosage varies significantly depending on the type of infection, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (oral or intravenous).  It's crucial to follow a healthcare professional's prescription precisely.  There's no single "standard" dosage.

**Oral:**  Dosage forms include capsules and solutions. Dosages typically range from 150mg to 450mg every 6-8 hours for adults, adjusted based on the infection's severity.  Pediatric dosages are calculated based on weight, typically 8-25 mg/kg/day divided into several doses.  Precise instructions will always be provided by the prescribing doctor.

**Intravenous (IV):**  This route is often used for severe infections.  Adult dosages typically range from 600mg to 2700mg per day, divided into several doses. Pediatric dosing for IV administration is also weight-based, and again,  must be determined and supervised by a physician.

**Important Note:**  Never alter the prescribed dosage or frequency without consulting your doctor.  This information is for general understanding only and does not substitute for professional medical advice.


### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Diarrhea (potentially severe, see below)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Rash
* Vaginal yeast infection


Less common but serious side effects include:

* *Clostridium difficile* associated diarrhea (CDAD): This can range from mild to life-threatening.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe diarrhea while taking clindamycin.
* Liver inflammation (hepatitis)
* Seizures (especially in patients with pre-existing conditions or high doses)
* Blood disorders


If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic. It works by binding to the bacterial ribosome, a structure responsible for protein synthesis within bacterial cells. This binding inhibits protein synthesis, preventing the bacteria from growing and multiplying, ultimately leading to their death.  Clindamycin's broad-spectrum activity means it's effective against a wide range of both Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria.


### Precautions
* **Allergy:**  Do not use clindamycin if you have a known allergy to clindamycin or lincomycin (a related antibiotic).
* **Liver disease:**  Use with caution in patients with liver problems.  Close monitoring may be necessary.
* **Kidney disease:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed in patients with impaired kidney function.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Clindamycin should be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Discuss this with your doctor.
* **Drug interactions:** Clindamycin can interact with certain other medications. Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Myasthenia gravis:** Clindamycin may worsen the symptoms of this neuromuscular disease.
* **Diarrhea:**  Pay close attention to any signs of diarrhea.  Severe diarrhea may be a sign of *C. difficile* infection, which requires prompt medical attention.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take clindamycin with alcohol?** A:  While there's no direct interaction, alcohol can worsen some side effects like nausea and stomach upset. It's best to avoid alcohol while taking clindamycin unless advised otherwise by your doctor.

* **Q: How should I store clindamycin?** A: Store clindamycin at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Specific storage instructions may vary depending on the formulation.  Check the label for details.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.  If you have concerns, contact your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking clindamycin when I feel better?** A: No. Continue taking clindamycin as prescribed, even if you feel better.  Stopping too early can lead to the infection returning and possibly becoming resistant to the antibiotic.
