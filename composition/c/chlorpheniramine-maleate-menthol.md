# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Menthol

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used for temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold or other upper respiratory allergies.  Specifically, it addresses:

* **Runny nose:** Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that helps dry up nasal secretions.
* **Itchiness:** Both chlorpheniramine maleate (antihistamine) and menthol (counter-irritant) can provide relief from itching and irritation in the nasal passages and throat.
* **Congestion (mild):** While not a primary decongestant, the drying effect of the antihistamine may offer some relief from mild congestion.  Menthol's cooling sensation can also provide a feeling of temporary relief.

**Important Note:** This combination is *not* intended for severe congestion. For significant nasal congestion, a decongestant should be considered separately or as part of a different formulation under medical guidance.


**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect of chlorpheniramine maleate. Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth:**  Both the antihistamine and the menthol can contribute to dry mouth.
* **Headache:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Constipation:**
* **Blurred vision:**


Less common but more serious side effects require immediate medical attention:

* **Allergic reactions:** such as rash, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (difficulty breathing).
* **Fast heartbeat:**
* **Seizures:**


**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine.  Histamines are chemicals released by the body during an allergic reaction. They cause symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itching. Chlorpheniramine blocks the action of histamine, reducing these symptoms.

* **Menthol:**  This is a counter-irritant.  It works by creating a cooling sensation on the skin and mucous membranes. This cooling effect can temporarily mask the itching and provide a feeling of relief.  It doesn't directly address the underlying cause of the symptoms.
