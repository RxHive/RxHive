# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Codeine + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Codeine Phosphate + Menthol

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to temporarily relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, or other upper respiratory allergies.  It specifically targets:

* **Cough:** Codeine phosphate acts as an opioid cough suppressant, reducing the urge to cough.
* **Runny nose/Sneezing:** Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that helps dry up nasal secretions and reduce sneezing.
* **Congestion:** Menthol provides a cooling sensation in the nasal passages, potentially offering temporary relief from congestion.  However, it's important to note that menthol doesn't directly address the underlying cause of congestion.

**It is crucial to understand that this is a combination of potentially habit-forming and sedating medications.  It should only be used as directed by a doctor and for a short period.**  Long-term use or exceeding recommended dosages can lead to serious health consequences.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person, but common ones include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect, particularly with codeine.  Avoid driving or operating machinery while using this medication.
* **Dry mouth, nose, and throat:**  A common side effect of both antihistamines and codeine.
* **Constipation:** Codeine is known to cause constipation.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Less common but possible.
* **Dizziness:**  Especially common with higher doses.
* **Headache:**
* **Lightheadedness:**
* **Confusion:** Particularly in older adults.
* **Difficulty urinating:**
* **Allergic reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions such as rash, hives, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (difficulty breathing) are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.

**How it Works:**

* **Codeine Phosphate:**  Acts on the central nervous system to suppress the cough reflex. It's an opioid analgesic, meaning it also has mild pain-relieving properties, though that's not its primary function in this combination.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  This helps reduce symptoms like runny nose and sneezing.
* **Menthol:**  A topical decongestant providing a cooling sensation that can offer temporary relief from congestion. It works by stimulating cold receptors in the nasal passages.
