# Cefaclor
### Generic Name
Cefaclor

### Usage
Cefaclor is a cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat a range of bacterial infections.  Its primary use is in treating bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, such as acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, pharyngitis (sore throat), and tonsillitis.  It's also effective against skin and skin structure infections, and otitis media (middle ear infection).  In some cases, it may be used to treat urinary tract infections.  It's important to note that Cefaclor is only effective against bacteria; it won't work against viral infections like the common cold or flu.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies depending on the type of infection and the formulation (immediate-release or extended-release). Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  General guidelines include:

* **Immediate-release tablets or capsules:** 250-500 mg every 8 hours.
* **Extended-release tablets:** 375-750 mg every 12 hours.  The specific dose will depend on the severity of the infection.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Cefaclor is also used in children, but the dosage is calculated based on weight (mg/kg/day) and is typically divided into doses given every 8-12 hours.  The maximum daily dose varies depending on the child's age and weight and should always be determined by a healthcare professional.  Infants under one month old should not be given Cefaclor. Always use the liquid suspension formulation for young children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with impaired kidney function. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you have kidney problems.  No dosage adjustment is generally recommended for those with liver impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Diarrhea
* Rash (various types)
* Vaginal yeast infection
* Increased eosinophils (a type of white blood cell)
* Elevated liver enzymes


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), including swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat; difficulty breathing
*  Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Pseudomembranous colitis (a severe bowel infection)
* Seizures
* Changes in blood counts (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Liver inflammation (hepatitis)
* Kidney inflammation (interstitial nephritis)


If you experience any of these side effects, stop taking Cefaclor and contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Cefaclor is a beta-lactam antibiotic. It works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to build and repair their cell walls. This weakening of the cell wall causes the bacterial cells to break down and die.  This mechanism makes it effective against many types of bacteria that commonly cause infections.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Cefaclor is contraindicated for patients with known allergies to cephalosporins or penicillins.  Individuals with penicillin allergies have a higher risk of an allergic reaction to Cefaclor.
* **Kidney Function:**  Patients with kidney problems may require dosage adjustments.
* **Gastrointestinal Issues:** Cefaclor can cause diarrhea; in severe cases, it can lead to pseudomembranous colitis, a potentially life-threatening condition.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Cefaclor is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy (category B), but it is excreted in breast milk and should be used cautiously during breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Cefaclor can interact with other medications. Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, vitamins, or supplements you are taking.
* **Alcohol:** While not directly contraindicated, excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided while taking Cefaclor.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Cefaclor with food?**  A:  Immediate-release formulations can usually be taken with or without food.  Extended-release tablets should generally be taken with food.

* **Q: How long should I take Cefaclor?**  A:  The duration of treatment depends on the type and severity of the infection and will be determined by your doctor.  Do not stop taking the medication prematurely, even if you feel better.
