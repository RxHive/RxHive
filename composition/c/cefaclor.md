# Cefaclor

**Generic Name:** Cefaclor

**Usage:** Cefaclor is an oral antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the ears (otitis media), sinuses (sinusitis), throat (pharyngitis), tonsils (tonsillitis), and lungs (pneumonia). It's also sometimes used for skin infections.  It is important to note that it is only effective against bacteria; it will not work for viral infections like the common cold or flu.  Always consult a doctor before using cefaclor to determine if it is the right treatment for your infection.  The doctor will prescribe the specific dosage and duration of treatment based on your individual needs.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, cefaclor can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
* **Allergic Reactions:** Rash, itching, hives (These can be serious and require immediate medical attention. Stop taking the medication and contact a doctor immediately if you experience these.)
* **Other:** Headache, dizziness, vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis)


Less common but more serious side effects can occur and include:

* **Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis):** Difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.  This is a medical emergency requiring immediate attention.
* **Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD):** This is a serious bowel infection that can occur after antibiotic use.  Symptoms include persistent diarrhea and abdominal cramps.
* **Seizures:** Although rare, especially at higher doses.
* **Liver problems:**  Rare, but can be serious.


**How it Works:** Cefaclor is a cephalosporin antibiotic.  Cephalosporins work by interfering with the ability of bacteria to build their cell walls.  This weakening of the cell wall ultimately leads to the death of the bacteria.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I take cefaclor with other medications?**  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking, as interactions can occur.  Some medications may increase the risk of side effects or reduce cefaclor's effectiveness.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not take two doses at once.  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.
* **How long does it take to work?** You may start to feel better within a few days, but it's crucial to complete the entire course of antibiotics prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better sooner. Stopping early can lead to recurrent infection and antibiotic resistance.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking cefaclor?**  Alcohol consumption is generally discouraged while taking antibiotics. It's best to avoid alcohol during your treatment or check with your doctor.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent.
* **Is cefaclor safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Discuss the risks and benefits of taking cefaclor during pregnancy or breastfeeding with your doctor.
* **Can cefaclor treat viral infections?** No, cefaclor only treats bacterial infections.  It will not work against viruses.
