# Carbamide Peroxide
### Generic Name
Carbamide Peroxide

### Usage

Carbamide peroxide is primarily used as a ceruminolytic agent, meaning it helps to soften and remove excessive earwax (cerumen).  This makes it easier to clean the ear canal.  It's also employed for cleansing canker sores (aphthous ulcers) and minor wounds or gum inflammation.  These irritations might stem from dental procedures, dentures, orthodontic appliances, accidental injuries, or other sources of mouth and gum irritation.  Additionally, it can help remove phlegm, mucus, or other secretions contributing to occasional mouth soreness.

### Dosage

**Earwax Removal (Otic Use):**

* **Adults:** 5-10 drops of 6.5% solution in each affected ear, twice daily (BID), for up to four days.
* **Children (under 12 years):** 1-5 drops of 6.5% solution in each affected ear, twice daily (BID), for up to four days.  Children 12 years and older follow the adult dosage.

**Mouth, Gum, or Dental Irritation (Oral Use):**

* **Adults and Children (2 years and older):** Apply 10% solution directly to the affected area as undiluted or use as an oral rinse, four times daily (QID) after meals and at bedtime.  For rinsing, swish for at least one minute, then expectorate. Avoid rinsing the mouth or drinking fluids for five minutes after use.


### Side Effects

* Localized erythema (redness)
* Skin rash
* Local irritation and redness
* Superinfection (secondary infection)


While rare, serious side effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.  If any side effects occur, consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.

### How it Works

Carbamide peroxide releases hydrogen peroxide, which, upon contact with catalase (an enzyme found in body tissues), produces nascent oxygen. This oxygen helps to break down and loosen earwax, making it easier to remove.  Its action on canker sores and gum inflammation is likely due to its cleansing and mild antiseptic properties.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Carbamide peroxide is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to carbamide peroxide or its components; those with a perforated eardrum (ear drum rupture), ear discharge, ear pain, irritation, or rash in the ear; and those with dizziness. Do not use ophthalmically (in the eyes). It's also contraindicated for children under 3 years old for oral use.

* **Interactions:** Although not extensively studied, potential interactions with other medications should be discussed with a healthcare professional.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Carbamide peroxide is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its effects on pregnancy are not fully known. While not excreted in breast milk, it's best to consult a doctor before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

* **Specific Populations:**  Children under 12 years old require a reduced dosage for otic use. Always follow the dosage instructions carefully for children.
