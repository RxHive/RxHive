# Cefoperazone + Tazobactum

**Generic Name:** Cefoperazone/Sulbactam

(Note:  Tazobactam is commonly paired with Piperacillin.  The combination with Cefoperazone is Sulbactam.)


**Usage:**

Cefoperazone/Sulbactam is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Intra-abdominal infections:** Infections of the abdomen, such as peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal lining) and infections following abdominal surgery.
* **Gynecological infections:** Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and other infections of the female reproductive organs.
* **Respiratory tract infections:** Severe pneumonia and other lung infections (often in combination with other treatments).
* **Skin and skin structure infections:**  Cellulitis, abscesses, and other serious skin infections.
* **Septicemia (bloodstream infections):**  Serious infections that spread throughout the body.
* **Bone and joint infections:** Osteomyelitis (bone infection)


**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, Cefoperazone/Sulbactam can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and pseudomembranous colitis (a serious bowel infection).
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:** Rash, itching, hives, and in rare cases, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).
* **Hepatic (liver):** Elevated liver enzymes (indicated by blood tests), jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and rarely, hepatitis (liver inflammation).
* **Hematologic (blood):**  Reduced blood cell counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), which can increase the risk of bleeding or infection.
* **Neurological:**  Headache, dizziness, seizures (rarely).
* **Renal (kidney):**  Increased creatinine levels (indicated by blood tests).
* **Injection site reactions:** Pain, swelling, and inflammation at the injection site.


**How it Works:**

Cefoperazone is a cephalosporin antibiotic. It works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to build their cell walls, leading to cell death. Sulbactam is a Î²-lactamase inhibitor.  Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by some bacteria that break down cephalosporins, rendering them ineffective. Sulbactam prevents this breakdown, allowing Cefoperazone to effectively kill bacteria that would otherwise be resistant.
