# Ciclesonide

**Generic Name:** Ciclesonide

**Usage:**

Ciclesonide is a corticosteroid used as an inhaled medication to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's primarily used to prevent asthma attacks and reduce inflammation in the airways. It may be used alone or in combination with other asthma medications.  It's not typically used for acute asthma attacks (for those, a short-acting bronchodilator is necessary).

**Side Effects:**

Like all inhaled corticosteroids, ciclesonide can cause side effects, although they are generally mild and infrequent compared to oral corticosteroids.  Common side effects include:

* **Throat irritation:**  This is often temporary and can be minimized by rinsing the mouth and throat after each inhalation.
* **Hoarseness:** Similar to throat irritation.
* **Headache:**  A relatively common side effect.
* **Thrush (oral candidiasis):**  A fungal infection of the mouth and throat.  This is more common with higher doses or prolonged use.  Good oral hygiene can help prevent this.
* **Cough:**  May be either a direct effect of the medication or a symptom of underlying respiratory issues.


**Less common but more serious side effects:**

* **Pneumonia:** Increased risk, especially in COPD patients.
* **Slowed growth in children:**  This is a concern with long-term use in children and adolescents; regular monitoring of growth is important.
* **Cataracts and glaucoma:**  Increased risk with long-term use.
* **Osteoporosis:** Increased risk with long-term, high-dose use.
* **Increased susceptibility to infections:**  Corticosteroids suppress the immune system.


**How it Works:**

Ciclesonide is a potent inhaled corticosteroid. It works by binding to glucocorticoid receptors within the cells of the airways. This reduces the production of inflammatory mediators, thereby decreasing airway inflammation and swelling, improving lung function and reducing symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath.  It does *not* directly relax the airways like a bronchodilator; its action is primarily anti-inflammatory.


**FAQs:**

* **Is ciclesonide addictive?** No, ciclesonide is not addictive.
* **Can I use ciclesonide during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Consult your doctor.  The benefits may outweigh the risks in some cases, but careful monitoring is needed.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The full effects of ciclesonide may take several days or weeks to become apparent.  Improvement in symptoms should be noticed gradually.
* **Can I stop taking ciclesonide suddenly?**  No, you should not stop taking ciclesonide suddenly unless advised by your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a worsening of your symptoms.  Your doctor will gradually reduce the dose if necessary.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
* **Can ciclesonide interact with other medications?** Yes, it can interact with some medications.  Inform your doctor about all the medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
