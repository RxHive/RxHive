# Ciclesonide
### Generic Name
Ciclesonide

### Usage
Ciclesonide is a corticosteroid medication primarily used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It works by reducing inflammation in the airways, thereby relieving symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath.  While its primary use is in respiratory conditions, it's important to note that ciclesonide is *not* used to treat acute asthma attacks; it's a preventative medication to manage ongoing symptoms and prevent exacerbations.  It is specifically designed for inhalation, meaning it is delivered directly to the lungs, minimizing systemic effects compared to oral corticosteroids.


### Dosage

Dosage of ciclesonide varies depending on the specific formulation (inhaler type and strength), the patient's age, the severity of the condition, and the physician's judgment.  It is crucial to follow the prescription instructions precisely.  There is no standard dosage for children versus adults; the prescription will be tailored to individual needs.  

* **Adults and Children (Asthma & COPD):** Dosage instructions will be provided on the inhaler label and by the prescribing physician.  This typically involves a specific number of inhalations per day, possibly divided between morning and evening.  The doctor will adjust the dose based on symptom control and lung function tests.

* **Oral Form:** Ciclesonide is not available in oral form.  All formulations are for inhalation use only.

* **Intravenous Form (IV):** Ciclesonide is not administered intravenously.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of ciclesonide, often mild and temporary, can include:

* Hoarseness
* Throat irritation
* Cough
* Oral thrush (fungal infection in the mouth)
* Headache


Less common, but more serious side effects, though rare with inhaled ciclesonide, warrant immediate medical attention:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Increased susceptibility to infections
* Changes in blood glucose levels (particularly in patients with diabetes)
* Slowed growth in children (long-term high doses)
* Glaucoma or cataracts (with prolonged use)


If you experience any of these side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Ciclesonide is a potent inhaled corticosteroid.  It works by binding to glucocorticoid receptors within the cells lining the airways. This binding action triggers a cascade of events that reduce inflammation.  Specifically, it suppresses the production of inflammatory mediators (chemicals responsible for airway swelling and narrowing), thus lessening the immune response and opening up the airways.  Because it's inhaled, it has a more localized effect on the lungs, reducing the systemic side effects compared to oral corticosteroids.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ciclesonide should not be used in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to ciclesonide or any of its components.

* **Drug Interactions:** While significant interactions are uncommon, inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions can occur.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of ciclesonide during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration and discussion with a healthcare professional. The potential benefits must be weighed against the potential risks.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly patients might be more susceptible to some side effects like osteoporosis or increased risk of infection.  Careful monitoring is advised.

* **Children:**  Growth monitoring is important in children using ciclesonide long-term.

* **Proper Inhaler Technique:** Incorrect inhaler use can reduce effectiveness.  It's vital to learn the proper technique from your doctor or pharmacist.  Rinsing the mouth after inhalation can help prevent oral thrush.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use ciclesonide for a sudden asthma attack?**  A: No, ciclesonide is a preventative medication, not a rescue inhaler.  Use a quick-relief inhaler (like albuterol) for acute attacks.

* **Q: How should I store ciclesonide?** A: Store the inhaler as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and extreme temperatures.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking ciclesonide suddenly?** A: No.  Always consult your doctor before stopping ciclesonide.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to a worsening of symptoms.

* **Q: Is ciclesonide addictive?** A: No, ciclesonide is not addictive.
