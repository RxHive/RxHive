**Side Effects:** Cyclophosphamide can cause a wide range of side effects, some mild and some severe. These can include:

* **Common side effects:** Nausea, vomiting, hair loss (alopecia), fatigue, mouth sores (mucositis), constipation, diarrhea.
* **Serious side effects:**  Infection (due to suppression of the immune system), bleeding, anemia, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), neutropenia (low neutrophil count), hemorrhagic cystitis (bladder inflammation and bleeding), infertility (both temporary and permanent), secondary cancers (long-term risk), cardiac toxicity (heart damage), kidney damage.  
* **Long-term effects:** Increased risk of certain types of cancer (e.g., bladder cancer), infertility, heart problems.

**How it Works:** Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent.  It works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, preventing them from reproducing and eventually leading to their death.  It is a prodrug, meaning it needs to be activated in the body to exert its cytotoxic (cell-killing) effects.  This activation primarily occurs in the liver.
