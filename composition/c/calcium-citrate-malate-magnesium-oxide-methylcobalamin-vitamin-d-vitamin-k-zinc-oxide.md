# Calcium Citrate Malate + Magnesium Oxide + Methylcobalamin + Vitamin D + Vitamin K + Zinc Oxide

**Generic Name:** Calcium Citrate Malate + Magnesium Oxide + Methylcobalamin + Vitamin D3 + Vitamin K2 + Zinc Oxide


**Usage:** This combination supplement is typically used to address nutritional deficiencies in calcium, magnesium, vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin), vitamin D, vitamin K, and zinc.  It's often marketed for bone health, energy levels, immune function, and overall well-being.  Specific uses might include:

* **Bone health:** Calcium and Vitamin D are crucial for bone formation and strength, while magnesium plays a supporting role. Vitamin K2 helps direct calcium to the bones.
* **Muscle function:** Magnesium and calcium are essential for muscle contractions and relaxation.
* **Energy production:** B12 is important for energy metabolism.
* **Immune support:** Zinc and Vitamins D & K contribute to a healthy immune system.
* **Nerve function:** B12 is vital for nerve function.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and depend on individual sensitivities and dosage.  They can include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, upset stomach (especially with higher doses of calcium, magnesium, or zinc).
* **Headache:**  Less common, but possible.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare, but possible.  Symptoms might include rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:** Each component works independently and synergistically to contribute to overall health:

* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** Provides readily absorbed calcium, crucial for bone health, muscle function, and nerve transmission. Citrate malate improves absorption compared to other calcium forms.
* **Magnesium Oxide:**  A source of magnesium, involved in hundreds of bodily processes, including muscle function, nerve function, blood sugar control, and blood pressure regulation.
* **Methylcobalamin:** The active form of vitamin B12, essential for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis.
* **Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol):** Essential for calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and various other bodily processes.
* **Vitamin K2 (Menquinone):**  Directs calcium to the bones and teeth, preventing its deposition in arteries.  Contributes to cardiovascular health.
* **Zinc Oxide:**  An important mineral for immune function, wound healing, and enzyme activity.
