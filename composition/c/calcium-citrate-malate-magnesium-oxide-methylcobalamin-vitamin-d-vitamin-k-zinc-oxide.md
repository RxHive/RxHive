# Calcium Citrate Malate + Magnesium Oxide + Methylcobalamin + Vitamin D + Vitamin K + Zinc Oxide
### Generic Name
Calcium Citrate Malate + Magnesium Oxide + Methylcobalamin + Vitamin D + Vitamin K + Zinc Oxide


### Usage

This combination of nutrients is primarily used as a dietary supplement to address or prevent deficiencies in calcium, magnesium, vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin), vitamin D, vitamin K, and zinc.  Each nutrient plays a crucial role in various bodily functions.  Calcium and magnesium are essential for bone health, muscle function, and nerve transmission. Vitamin B12 is vital for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. Vitamin D is crucial for calcium absorption, bone health, and immune function. Vitamin K is important for blood clotting and bone metabolism. Finally, zinc is involved in numerous enzymatic processes, immune function, and wound healing.  This supplement is often recommended for individuals at risk of deficiency due to dietary restrictions, malabsorption issues, or increased nutritional needs (e.g., pregnancy, lactation, aging). It may also be used as a supportive therapy alongside other treatments for conditions affecting bone health or nutrient metabolism.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation and individual needs.  Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.  There isn't a standardized dosage across all brands.  Oral formulations typically involve tablets or capsules taken with food.  There are no IV formulations of this specific combined nutrient supplement.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on factors such as age, weight, existing health conditions, and the severity of any deficiencies.  Self-medicating with higher doses than recommended is not advised.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

*   Gastrointestinal upset (e.g., constipation, diarrhea, nausea)
*   Headache
*   Mild allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching)


Less common, but potentially more serious side effects can occur.  These require immediate medical attention:

*   Severe allergic reactions (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue)
*   Kidney stones (with high calcium intake)
*   Hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium levels)
*   Hypermagnesemia (elevated blood magnesium levels)


If you experience any adverse effects, stop taking the supplement and consult a doctor.
