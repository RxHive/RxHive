# Cefixime + Clavulanic Acid
### Generic Name
Cefixime + Clavulanic Acid

### Usage

Cefixime and Clavulanic acid is a combination antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections.  Cefixime belongs to a class of drugs called cephalosporins, which work by interfering with the bacteria's ability to build cell walls, ultimately killing them. Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor.  Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by some bacteria that break down cephalosporins and other antibiotics like penicillins, rendering them ineffective.  By inhibiting these enzymes, clavulanic acid protects cefixime, allowing it to work effectively against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant.

This combination is primarily used to treat infections of the:

* **Respiratory tract:**  Including bronchitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis.
* **Urinary tract:** Such as cystitis (bladder infection) and pyelonephritis (kidney infection).
* **Skin and skin structures:** Including cellulitis and abscesses.
* **Ear:**  Such as otitis media (middle ear infection).


While not a primary use, this combination *may* be considered in certain cases of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), depending on the specific bacteria involved and susceptibility testing.  However, this should only be done under strict medical supervision and based on a doctor's assessment.  It's crucial to note that this combination is **not** effective against all types of bacteria, and proper diagnosis and susceptibility testing are crucial for effective treatment.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the patient's age, weight, the severity of the infection, and the specific formulation (e.g., tablets, suspension).  Always follow your doctor's prescription instructions carefully.  The information below is for general guidance only and should not be considered medical advice.  **Never adjust your dosage without consulting your physician.**


**Adults (Oral):** The typical dose is one tablet or spoonful of suspension, usually once or twice a day, as prescribed.  The duration of treatment is typically 7-14 days but depends on the type and severity of the infection.

**Children (Oral):** Dosage for children is calculated based on weight and is usually determined by the physician. The medication is often available in a liquid suspension form for easier administration.

**IV Administration:**  Cefixime and Clavulanic acid combination is not typically administered intravenously. Intravenous administration of cefixime may be available separately, but it's crucial to understand that this is a different medication than the oral combination discussed here and should only be used under medical supervision.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash

Less common, but more serious, side effects require immediate medical attention:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), including difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue
*  Seizures
*  Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (a serious bowel infection)
*  Changes in liver function (indicated by abnormal liver blood tests)


If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Cefixime, a cephalosporin antibiotic, works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.  Bacteria need a strong cell wall to survive.  By preventing the formation of this crucial structure, cefixime causes the bacterial cells to weaken and ultimately burst, leading to bacterial death.  Clavulanic acid acts as a protective agent, preventing certain bacteria from breaking down cefixime using their beta-lactamase enzymes.  This dual action ensures broader effectiveness against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant to cefixime alone.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Do not take this medication if you are allergic to penicillin, cephalosporins, or any other component of the medication.  Inform your doctor about all allergies before taking this medication.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This medication may interact with other drugs, including anticoagulants (blood thinners) and some antacids.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Discuss the use of this medication with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with kidney problems.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on your kidney function.
* **Liver Disease:**  Caution is advised in patients with liver disease.  Close monitoring of liver function is recommended.
* **Children:**  Dosage for children should always be determined by a healthcare professional, based on weight and other relevant factors.
* **Elderly Patients:** Elderly individuals may be more susceptible to side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication when I feel better?**  A: No.  Continue taking the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better, to ensure the complete eradication of the infection.  Stopping early can lead to recurrence or the development of antibiotic resistance.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?**  A: Store the medication in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat, as directed on the label.  Keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q: Is it safe to drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  A:  Alcohol can interact with some antibiotics and increase the risk of side effects.  It is best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication, or to discuss it with your doctor.
* **Q:  Will this medication cure all bacterial infections?**  A: No. This medication is effective against certain types of bacteria. Your doctor will determine if it is the appropriate treatment for your specific infection based on testing and diagnosis.
