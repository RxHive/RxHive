# Cefixime + Clavulanic Acid

**Generic Name:** Cefixime + Clavulanic Acid

**Usage:**  Cefixime/clavulanate is a combination antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections.  The specific infections treated will depend on the doctor's prescription and the severity of the infection. Common uses include:

* **Respiratory tract infections:**  Bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis (sinus infection).
* **Ear infections (otitis media):**  Especially in cases where other antibiotics have failed.
* **Skin and skin structure infections:**  Cellulitis, abscesses.
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):**  Cystitis, pyelonephritis (kidney infection).

**Note:** This combination is not effective against all types of bacterial infections.  The doctor will determine if it's the appropriate treatment based on the specific bacteria causing the infection.  Improper use can lead to antibiotic resistance.

**Side Effects:** Like all medications, Cefixime/clavulanate can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, indigestion.  These are often mild and transient.  Severe diarrhea could indicate *Clostridium difficile* infection (a serious complication).
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives, swelling (angioedema), difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis â€“ a medical emergency).
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis)**
* **Changes in taste**


Less common, but more serious side effects can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:

* **Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)**
* **Seizures**
* **Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)**
* **Dark urine**
* **Clay-colored stools**
* **Severe abdominal pain**


**How it Works:**

Cefixime is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It works by interfering with the bacteria's ability to build cell walls, leading to bacterial cell death. Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor.  Many bacteria produce beta-lactamases, enzymes that break down beta-lactam antibiotics (like cefixime). Clavulanic acid inhibits these enzymes, allowing cefixime to effectively kill the bacteria.  The combination broadens the spectrum of bacteria the medication can effectively treat.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take Cefixime/clavulanate with other medications?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins.  Interactions can occur.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Cefixime/clavulanate?**  It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking antibiotics, as it can exacerbate side effects or interact with the medication. Consult your doctor.
* **What if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **How long should I take Cefixime/clavulanate?**  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Do not stop taking the medication early, even if you feel better, to ensure the infection is completely cleared. Stopping too soon can lead to recurrence or antibiotic resistance.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Mild side effects often resolve on their own.  Contact your doctor if side effects are severe, persistent, or concerning.  Seek immediate medical attention for signs of a severe allergic reaction.
