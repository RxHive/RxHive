# Cellulase
### Generic Name
Cellulase

### Usage

Cellulase is an enzyme that breaks down cellulose, a complex carbohydrate found in plant cell walls.  Humans lack the ability to produce cellulase naturally, meaning we can't fully digest cellulose on our own.  Therefore, cellulase supplements are used primarily to aid in the digestion of plant-based foods.  This is particularly helpful for individuals experiencing digestive discomfort associated with high-fiber diets.  Cellulase's primary use is in treating digestive issues related to cellulose, such as:

* **Phytobezoars:** These are masses of undigested plant material that can accumulate in the stomach or intestines, causing discomfort and blockage. Cellulase helps break down these masses, relieving symptoms.
* **Bloating:**  Difficulty digesting cellulose can lead to bloating and gas. Cellulase supplementation can help alleviate these symptoms by facilitating the breakdown of cellulose.
* **Flatulence:** Similar to bloating, excessive gas production after consuming plant-based foods can be reduced with cellulase supplementation.
* **Abdominal fullness:** A feeling of fullness or discomfort in the abdomen after meals, particularly after consuming high-fiber foods, may be improved with cellulase.


### Dosage

Dosage of cellulase varies greatly depending on the product formulation (tablets, capsules, liquids), the individual's specific needs, and the severity of their digestive symptoms.  It's crucial to follow the dosage instructions provided on the specific product packaging.  Generally, adults may take cellulase supplements with meals containing high cellulose content.   There are no established dosages specifically for children, and use in children should be guided by a healthcare professional.   Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting cellulase supplementation, especially for children and individuals with pre-existing medical conditions.


### Side Effects

Cellulase is generally well-tolerated, but some individuals may experience mild side effects, including:

* Mild stomach upset
* Diarrhea
* Nausea


Serious side effects are rare but possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe allergic reactions such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, or hives.


### How it Works

Cellulase works by catalyzing the hydrolysis of beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds in cellulose.  This essentially breaks down the long cellulose chains into smaller units, such as glucose and cellobiose.  These smaller units are then more easily absorbed and digested by the body, reducing the burden on the digestive system and alleviating symptoms related to incomplete cellulose digestion.  The process is similar to how other digestive enzymes help break down proteins, fats, and other complex carbohydrates.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Individuals with known allergies to fungal sources (as many cellulase products are derived from fungi) should exercise caution and consult a healthcare professional before using cellulase supplements.
* **Drug Interactions:**  There is limited information on specific drug interactions with cellulase. However, it's always advisable to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you're taking to avoid potential unforeseen interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of cellulase during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Consult a healthcare professional before using cellulase if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Underlying Medical Conditions:** Individuals with pre-existing digestive disorders or other health conditions should discuss cellulase supplementation with their doctor to ensure it's appropriate.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for cellulase to work?**  A: The effects of cellulase can vary, but relief from symptoms like bloating and gas is often experienced relatively quickly after taking the supplement with a meal.
* **Q: Can I take cellulase every day?**  A: While cellulase is generally safe for short-term use, daily use over extended periods requires medical guidance.
* **Q: How should I store cellulase?**  A: Store cellulase supplements according to the instructions on the product label, usually in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: Is cellulase right for me?** A:  If you experience persistent digestive issues related to high-fiber diets, consult your doctor to determine if cellulase supplementation is appropriate for your individual situation.
