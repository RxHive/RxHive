# Clobetasone + Nadifloxacin

**Generic Name:** Clobetasone butyrate + Nadifloxacin

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid and antibiotic used to treat skin infections that are both inflamed and infected.  It's typically prescribed for conditions like:

* **Bacterial infections of the skin accompanied by inflammation:** This includes conditions like impetigo, folliculitis, and secondary bacterial infections of eczema or psoriasis.  The specific bacterial types it treats are those sensitive to nadifloxacin.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the length of treatment and the area of skin treated. Common side effects include:

* **At the application site:** Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, redness, irritation, thinning of the skin, skin discoloration (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation), acne-like rash, and folliculitis.
* **Systemic side effects (less common, especially with short-term use):** These are more likely with large areas of application or prolonged use and include adrenal suppression (especially in children and with occlusive dressings).  Other potential systemic effects are rare but include increased blood sugar levels, cataracts, glaucoma, and growth retardation in children.


**How it Works:**

* **Clobetasone butyrate:** This is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation by suppressing the immune response in the skin. It helps to reduce redness, swelling, itching, and discomfort associated with the infection.
* **Nadifloxacin:** This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that kills bacteria by interfering with their DNA replication and repair. It effectively targets a broad spectrum of bacteria commonly causing skin infections.

The combination of clobetasone butyrate and nadifloxacin provides both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects, making it effective in treating inflammatory skin infections.
