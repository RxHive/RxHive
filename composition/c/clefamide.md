# Clefamide
### Generic Name
Clefamide

### Usage
Clefamide is an antiprotozoal drug, specifically a luminal amoebicide.  Its primary use was in the treatment of intestinal infections caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*, a parasite that can lead to amoebiasis, a disease ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe dysentery and potentially life-threatening complications like liver abscesses.  It's important to note that Clefamide is no longer in clinical use and has been discontinued.  Therefore, it is not currently available for prescription or treatment.

### Dosage
Because Clefamide is no longer used clinically, specific dosage recommendations are not relevant.  Information regarding dosage regimens for adults and children, different formulations (if any existed), and administration instructions are unavailable due to the drug's discontinuation.

### Side Effects
Since Clefamide is no longer used, a comprehensive list of its side effects is not readily available through current medical resources.  However, it is reasonable to assume that, like other antiprotozoal medications, side effects could have included gastrointestinal upset (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis), and other potential adverse events depending on individual patient factors.

### How it Works
Clefamide functioned as a luminal amoebicide. This means it primarily acted within the lumen (the interior space) of the intestines.  The precise mechanism of action isn't detailed in readily available contemporary sources because of its discontinued status, but its effect was to kill *Entamoeba histolytica* parasites present in the bowel. This action helped eliminate the infection and resolve symptoms.

### Precautions
As Clefamide is no longer used clinically, specific precautions are not readily accessible. However, given its antiprotozoal nature, potential precautions may have included considerations for patients with pre-existing liver or kidney conditions, as well as potential drug interactions with other medications. Information on its safety during pregnancy or breastfeeding would also be unavailable in current clinical resources.  It is crucial to understand that any attempt to obtain or use Clefamide would be unsafe and ineffective due to its discontinuation.
