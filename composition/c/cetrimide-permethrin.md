# Cetrimide + Permethrin

**Generic Name:** Cetrimide + Permethrin Cream/Lotion

**Usage:**  This combination is primarily used topically to treat scabies and pediculosis (head lice, body lice, and pubic lice).  Cetrimide is a cationic surfactant with antiseptic properties, while permethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide that kills lice and scabies mites.  The combination offers a synergistic effect, enhancing the efficacy of each component.  Always follow the instructions provided by a doctor or pharmacist on application frequency and duration of treatment.  Specific application areas will vary depending on the infestation (e.g., scalp, body, pubic area).

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and infrequent, but can include:

* **Local reactions:**  Burning, stinging, itching, redness, dryness, irritation at the application site.  These are usually temporary.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions such as rash, hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing can occur. Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.
* **Other:**  Headache, nausea (rare).


**How it Works:**

* **Permethrin:** This is the primary active ingredient against parasites. It works by interfering with the sodium channels in the nerve membranes of lice and scabies mites, leading to paralysis and death.

* **Cetrimide:** While not directly insecticidal against lice or scabies mites in the same way as permethrin, it contributes by possessing antiseptic properties that help prevent secondary bacterial infections that may occur due to scratching or irritation. It also enhances the penetration of permethrin.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  It usually takes a few days to a week to see a reduction in symptoms.  Complete eradication of lice and scabies mites may take longer, depending on the severity of the infestation and adherence to treatment instructions.  A follow-up treatment may be necessary.

* **Q: Can I use this on children?** A:  Use as directed by a doctor.  Different formulations and concentrations may be recommended for children, based on their age and weight.

Follow the instructions on the label carefully.  Generally, it's recommended to leave the medication on for the specified time before washing.
