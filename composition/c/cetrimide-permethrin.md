### Generic Name
Cetrimide + Permethrin

**Please Note:**  Cetrimide and Permethrin are typically used as separate components in different formulations, not usually combined in a single generic medicine.  Information below addresses each component individually, as their combined use would depend entirely on the specific formulation and instructions provided by a healthcare professional.  It is crucial to follow the prescribing information exactly.  This is not a recommendation for self-medication.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before using any medication.


### Usage (Cetrimide)

Cetrimide is an antiseptic, primarily used topically to disinfect skin and wounds. Its main use is for cleansing and preparing the skin before surgery or injections. It can also be used to treat minor skin infections and wounds.


### Usage (Permethrin)

### Dosage (Permethrin)

* **For Head Lice:**  A 1% permethrin cream rinse is commonly used.  The exact application method and duration are detailed on the product packaging. Typically, the hair and scalp are treated, left for a specific time (usually 10 minutes), and then thoroughly rinsed.  A second treatment may be needed after a week.
* **For Scabies:**  A 5% permethrin cream is applied to the entire body from the neck down, avoiding the face and eyes.  It's left on for 8-14 hours, then washed off.  A second application may be recommended after a week.
