# Citric Acid + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Citric Acid + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination is typically found in over-the-counter (OTC) cold and allergy medications.  Citric acid acts as an acidulant, providing a tart flavor and potentially helping to enhance the palatability of the medication.  Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that works to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, hay fever, and other allergies.  These symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, and itching. It's crucial to note that this combination is often found in multi-ingredient formulations, and its use is primarily symptomatic relief, not a cure for the underlying condition.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the dosage and individual sensitivity but may include:

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness, headache, constipation, upset stomach.
* **Less Common:**  Blurred vision, urinary retention, increased heart rate.
* **Rare but serious:**  Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).

This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult the medication's label or a healthcare professional for complete information.

**How it Works:**

* **Citric Acid:**  As mentioned, citric acid serves primarily as a flavoring agent and may aid in the dissolution of the other ingredients.  It has no direct therapeutic effect on cold or allergy symptoms.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  This is a first-generation antihistamine. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking histamine, it reduces the symptoms of allergies and the common cold.
