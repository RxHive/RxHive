# Citric Acid + Chlorpheniramine Maleate
### Generic Name: Citric Acid + Chlorpheniramine Maleate


This combination is not typically found as a single, named generic medicine.  Citric acid is a common food additive and buffering agent, while chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine.  They are often combined in over-the-counter (OTC) medications, primarily to create a palatable and effective formulation for treating allergy symptoms.  Therefore, the information below refers to chlorpheniramine maleate's properties and effects, acknowledging its frequent use alongside citric acid as a flavoring and buffering agent.


### Usage

Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergies and the common cold.  These symptoms include:

* **Runny nose:**  Chlorpheniramine blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions, which causes nasal congestion and runny nose.
* **Sneezing:** By reducing histamine's effects, it lessens the frequency and intensity of sneezing.
* **Itchy, watery eyes:** Similar to its effect on the nose, it helps alleviate the irritation and watering associated with allergic conjunctivitis.
* **Itching:**  It can reduce itching associated with allergic reactions on the skin.


The citric acid in the formulation serves as an acidulant (adds tartness) and a buffer, improving the taste and stability of the medication, especially in liquid forms like syrups.  It doesn't have a direct therapeutic role in treating allergies.


### Dosage

Dosage for chlorpheniramine maleate varies depending on the formulation (tablet, syrup, liquid), the age of the patient, and the severity of symptoms.  **Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.**  It's crucial to avoid exceeding the recommended dosage.  There is no standard IV formulation for chlorpheniramine maleate; it's generally administered orally.


* **Adults:**  Typical oral doses range from 4 to 8 mg per dose, taken every 4 to 6 hours as needed.  However, exceeding 24 mg in a 24-hour period is generally discouraged.
* **Children:**  Dosage for children is significantly lower and depends on weight and age.  Always consult a pediatrician or follow the specific dosage instructions provided for children's formulations.  Never administer adult formulations to children.


**Note:** Specific dosage instructions for any OTC medication containing chlorpheniramine maleate and citric acid must be obtained from the product packaging.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of chlorpheniramine maleate can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Upset stomach


Less common, but potentially more serious side effects may include:

* Difficulty urinating
* Fast heart rate
* Confusion
* Seizures (rare)
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing)


If you experience any concerning side effects, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Chlorpheniramine maleate is a first-generation antihistamine. It works by competitively blocking histamine from binding to its receptors (H1 receptors) in various tissues throughout the body.  By preventing histamine from binding, it inhibits the cascade of events that lead to the typical allergy symptoms, such as runny nose, sneezing, and itching.


### Precautions

* **Pregnant or breastfeeding women:**  Consult a doctor before taking chlorpheniramine maleate during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Elderly individuals:**  Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of chlorpheniramine maleate, particularly drowsiness and dizziness.
* **Individuals with certain medical conditions:**  Those with glaucoma, prostate enlargement, asthma, or heart conditions should consult a physician before using this medication.
* **Drug interactions:** Chlorpheniramine maleate may interact with other medications, including sedatives, alcohol, and certain antidepressants.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.
* **Driving and operating machinery:**  Because of potential drowsiness, avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
* **Alcohol consumption:**  Avoid alcohol while taking chlorpheniramine maleate as it can potentiate drowsiness.
