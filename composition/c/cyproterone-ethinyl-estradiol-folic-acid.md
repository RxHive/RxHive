# Cyproterone + Ethinyl Estradiol + Folic Acid
### Generic Name
Cyproterone Acetate + Ethinylestradiol + Folic Acid

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used for hormone therapy in women, specifically for the treatment of acne and hirsutism (excessive hair growth) associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  It works by regulating hormone levels, reducing androgen production (male hormones), and minimizing the effects of hormonal imbalances that contribute to these conditions.  It's also sometimes prescribed for managing severe acne not responding to other treatments, and less commonly, in the management of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), though this is not its primary use.  This specific combination also includes folic acid, which is crucial for women of childbearing age, especially those planning a pregnancy, as it helps prevent neural tube defects in developing fetuses. It is vital to understand that this medication does *not* treat infertility directly.

### Dosage

Dosage should *always* be determined and supervised by a physician.  There is no standard dosage as it is tailored to the individual patient's needs and response.  It is typically administered orally, usually as a tablet taken once daily, at the same time each day, following the doctor's instructions precisely.  The specific dosage of cyproterone acetate, ethinylestradiol, and folic acid will vary depending on the individual's condition and response.

**There are no standard pediatric dosages for this specific combination medication.** Use in children and adolescents is generally not recommended unless specifically prescribed and monitored by a specialist for conditions such as precocious puberty where a physician determines the risk/benefit to be favorable. IV administration isn't applicable to this combination.

### How it Works

This medication is a combination of three active components. Cyproterone acetate is an antiandrogen, meaning it blocks the effects of male hormones (androgens) like testosterone. Ethinylestradiol is a synthetic estrogen that helps balance hormone levels and regulate the menstrual cycle. The addition of folic acid supplements a crucial nutrient essential for cell growth and development, particularly relevant in women of childbearing age. By reducing androgen levels and balancing hormones, it helps improve acne, hirsutism, and other symptoms associated with hormonal imbalances.  The combination's effectiveness stems from the synergistic action of these three components.
