# Cyclandelate
### Generic Name
Cyclandelate

### Usage
Cyclandelate is a medication primarily used to improve blood flow in the blood vessels.  Its main applications are in treating conditions affecting the arteries of the limbs (peripheral vascular disease) and those affecting the arteries in the brain (cerebrovascular disease).  Specifically, it's used to manage symptoms like intermittent claudication (pain in the legs during walking due to reduced blood flow), arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), and Raynaud's phenomenon (reduced blood flow to the fingers and toes, causing them to turn white or blue).  It may also be used to help alleviate nocturnal leg cramps.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  The dosage of cyclandelate varies depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response. Typically, it's administered orally.  The initial dose can be up to 2 grams per day, and the maintenance dose usually ranges from 800 to 1200 mg per day, divided into several doses.  The maximum daily dose is generally 2 grams.  Specific dosage adjustments should be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual patient needs.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of cyclandelate in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Currently, there are no specific dosage adjustments recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment based on manufacturer labeling.  However, this does not mean adjustments are not necessary, and a doctor should evaluate the patient's overall health when prescribing it.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of cyclandelate can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Drowsiness
* Tiredness
* Weakness
* Flushing (reddening of the skin)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea (possibly bloody)
* Heartburn
* Fever
* Joint or muscle pain
* Sweating

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects are possible and warrant immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Cyclandelate is a vasodilator, meaning it works by widening (dilating) the blood vessels. It achieves this by directly relaxing the smooth muscles in the walls of arteries and veins. This relaxation allows for increased blood flow, which can help alleviate the symptoms of reduced blood circulation in the limbs and brain.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  Cyclandelate is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to cyclandelate or other vasodilators, and those experiencing the acute phase of a stroke.

**Warnings and Cautions:**

* Use with caution in patients with severe coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, a history of fainting (syncope), active bleeding, bleeding disorders, glaucoma, or who have recently experienced a heart attack.
* Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects and require careful monitoring.

**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of cyclandelate during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  A doctor should be consulted before using this medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.

**Drug Interactions:**  Cyclandelate may interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
