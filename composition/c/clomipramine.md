# Clomipramine
### Generic Name
Clomipramine

### Usage
Clomipramine is primarily used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a condition characterized by recurring unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions).  It helps reduce the severity of both obsessions and compulsions, improving the patient's overall quality of life.  While not its primary indication, clomipramine is also sometimes used as an adjunctive therapy for cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness) associated with narcolepsy.  It's important to note that its use in other conditions like panic disorder, major depressive disorder, or premature ejaculation is considered off-label, meaning it's not officially approved for these uses by regulatory bodies but may be prescribed by doctors in specific circumstances.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, and response to the medication.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  

**Adults:**

* **OCD:**  Treatment typically starts with a low dose (25 mg/day) at bedtime, gradually increasing over two weeks as tolerated, up to a maximum of 250 mg/day. The maximum dose should only be reached if the lower doses are well tolerated.
* **Cataplexy (adjunctive):**  Initiation is usually at 10 mg/day, with gradual increases (as needed and tolerated) up to 150 mg/day, or even a maximum of 250 mg/day in severe cases.  The medication is often divided into multiple doses throughout the day or given as a single dose at bedtime.
* **Off-label uses (panic disorder, major depressive disorder, etc.):**  Starting doses and titration schedules vary greatly depending on the condition and the physician's judgment.  Always consult your doctor for personalized guidance.


**Children (aged 10 years and older, OCD only):**  The initial dose is 25 mg/day, gradually increased (as tolerated) to a maximum of 3 mg/kg of body weight per day or 100 mg/day, whichever is lower.  The maintenance dose may be divided into smaller doses with meals to reduce potential gastrointestinal side effects.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with impaired liver or kidney function, but careful monitoring is recommended.  Significant interactions can occur with other medications, particularly monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). A significant time gap (at least 14 days) should be maintained between stopping an MAOI and starting clomipramine, and vice-versa.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Insomnia
* Nervousness
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Dry mouth
* Changes in appetite or weight
* Sexual dysfunction

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Seizures
* Heart problems (e.g., irregular heartbeat, palpitations)
* Low blood pressure (especially upon standing)
* Serotonin syndrome (a rare but potentially life-threatening condition)
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant. It works by affecting the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, neurotransmitters that play a crucial role in mood, behavior, and thought processes.  By increasing the availability of these neurotransmitters, clomipramine helps alleviate the symptoms of OCD and other conditions it's used to treat.  Its active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine, also contributes to its effects on neurotransmission.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Clomipramine is contraindicated in patients with a known allergy to the drug or other tricyclic antidepressants, those currently taking MAOIs or those recently (within 14 days) discontinued them. It's also contraindicated in patients with acute recovery from a myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, narrow-angle glaucoma, and those with a history of blood disorders.
* **Interactions:**  Clomipramine can interact significantly with many other medications, including MAOIs, other antidepressants, certain heart medications, and sedatives.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Clomipramine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been fully established.  It's also excreted in breast milk, posing a potential risk to breastfeeding infants.  Consult your doctor regarding the risks and benefits.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults are at increased risk of side effects, especially anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision) and orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing).  Careful monitoring and lower initial doses might be necessary.
* **Children:** Clomipramine is generally not used in children except for the treatment of OCD in those 10 years or older.  Careful monitoring for suicidality is critical.
* **Suicidality:**  There's an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, especially in young adults, when starting antidepressant medication.  Close monitoring is essential, especially at the beginning of treatment and during dose adjustments.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The full therapeutic effects of clomipramine may not be seen for several weeks.  You may notice some improvement sooner, but it typically takes consistent use for several weeks to experience significant symptom reduction.

* **Q: Can I stop taking it suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping clomipramine can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping the medication; they will advise on a gradual tapering schedule to minimize withdrawal effects.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: How should I store clomipramine?** A: Store clomipramine in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, and out of reach of children.

* **Q: Is clomipramine habit-forming?** A:  Clomipramine is not considered habit-forming in the same way as some other medications, but stopping it abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for discontinuation.
