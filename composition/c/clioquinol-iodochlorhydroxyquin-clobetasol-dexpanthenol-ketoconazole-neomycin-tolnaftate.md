# Clioquinol Iodochlorhydroxyquin + Clobetasol + Dexpanthenol + Ketoconazole + Neomycin + Tolnaftate

It's crucial to understand that combining these six ingredients (Clioquinol, Iodochlorhydroxyquin, Clobetasol, Dexpanthenol, Ketoconazole, Neomycin, and Tolnaftate) into a single preparation is **highly unusual and not standard medical practice.**  Such a combination would likely have significant potential for interactions and adverse effects.  There is no commercially available, approved formulation containing all six ingredients listed.

Therefore, providing specific details like "How it Works" and listing common side effects for this hypothetical combination is impossible and irresponsible. Prescribing such a mixture would be extremely dangerous.  

If you encountered this combination in a product label, it is likely mislabeled, counterfeit, or a significant error.  **Do not use a product containing this combination without consulting a qualified medical professional immediately.**


Instead of providing details on this improbable mixture, let's address each individual ingredient and its typical usage:

**Individual Ingredients and Their Typical Usage:**

* **Generic Name:**  (Each ingredient listed separately)
    * Clioquinol (also known as Iodochlorhydroxyquin): An antimicrobial agent used topically to treat certain skin infections.
