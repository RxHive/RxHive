# Calfactant
### Generic Name
Calfactant

### Usage
Calfactant is a lung surfactant used primarily to prevent and treat respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants.  RDS is a serious breathing problem caused by a lack of surfactant in the lungs. Surfactant is a substance that helps keep the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) open, allowing for efficient breathing.  Calfactant replaces this missing surfactant.

Prophylactic (preventive) use of Calfactant is recommended for premature infants born before 29 weeks of gestational age who are at high risk of developing RDS.  It's also used therapeutically to treat premature infants (up to 72 hours old) who have already developed RDS, confirmed by clinical and radiological findings, and require breathing support via an endotracheal tube.  Calfactant is *not* indicated for use in adults.

### Dosage

**Pediatric Dosage (Premature Infants):** Calfactant is administered intratracheally (directly into the trachea via an endotracheal tube). The dosage is 3 mL/kg (based on birth weight), given every 12 hours, for up to a total of three doses.  Administration involves dividing the dose, usually into two aliquots (1.5 mL/kg each), with the infant repositioned between administrations. The medication should be gently swirled, not shaken, before use.  Specific administration techniques, including timing with ventilator breaths and infant positioning, are crucial and should be followed precisely by trained medical professionals.


**Adult Dosage:** Calfactant is not approved for use in adults.


### Side Effects

The following side effects have been observed with Calfactant:

* **Common:** Bradycardia (slow heart rate), Endotracheal tube reflux (backflow of fluid into the tube), Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen), and Airway obstruction.
* **Less Common but Serious:** While less frequent, serious adverse events can occur and necessitate immediate medical attention.  Always consult a healthcare provider if any adverse effects are observed.


### How it Works

Calfactant works by replacing the missing or deficient surfactant in the lungs of premature infants.  Surfactant reduces surface tension in the alveoli, preventing them from collapsing during exhalation.  By restoring surfactant levels, Calfactant helps to improve lung expansion, gas exchange, and overall respiratory function in infants with RDS.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  There are no specific contraindications listed by the manufacturer. However, close monitoring is crucial due to potential risks.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Calfactant can interact with other medications that cause bradycardia (slow heart rate). Careful monitoring is essential if other bradycardia-inducing drugs are used concurrently.
* **Warnings:**  Calfactant can increase the risk of transient bradycardia, decreased oxygen saturation, and endotracheal tube blockage or reflux.  Continuous monitoring of heart rate and oxygen saturation is critical during and after administration.  The administration procedure itself requires skilled medical professionals experienced in neonatal respiratory care.
* **Specific Populations:** Calfactant is specifically formulated for use in premature infants with RDS.  It is not appropriate for use in full-term infants or adults.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Calfactant administered?**  A: Calfactant is administered intratracheally (directly into the trachea via an endotracheal tube) by trained medical professionals.
* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A: Signs of serious side effects can include severe bradycardia, persistent cyanosis, and significant respiratory distress. If you notice any concerning symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.
* **Q: How is Calfactant stored?** A: Storage instructions should be followed precisely as indicated on the product label.
* **Q: Is Calfactant safe for full-term infants?** A: No, Calfactant is specifically indicated for premature infants at risk of or with RDS.  Its use in full-term infants is not appropriate.
* **Q: What should I do if my baby experiences side effects after Calfactant administration?** A:  Immediately inform the healthcare professionals providing care.  They will assess the situation and take appropriate action.
