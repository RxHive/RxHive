# Canagliflozin
### Generic Name
Canagliflozin

### Usage
Canagliflozin is primarily used to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's used as an adjunct to diet and exercise, meaning it works best when combined with lifestyle changes.  Importantly, it's *not* used for type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

Beyond blood sugar control, canagliflozin also plays a significant role in cardiovascular health for individuals with type 2 diabetes.  It's prescribed to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in those with established cardiovascular disease.  Furthermore, it helps lower the risk of developing end-stage kidney disease, experiencing a doubling of serum creatinine levels, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease) with albuminuria (protein in the urine).


### Dosage
Dosage for adults with type 2 diabetes typically starts with 100 mg once daily, taken before the first meal.  For those tolerating the 100 mg dose and who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher and still need better blood sugar control, the dose can be increased to 300 mg once daily.  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (see Precautions).  Canagliflozin is not recommended for children under 18 years old, as safety and efficacy haven't been established in this age group.  The medication is available in tablet form.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Genitourinary fungal infections
Less frequent but still possible side effects (1-10% of patients) include:
* Fatigue
* Falling
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Abdominal pain
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Hypovolemia (low blood volume)
* Increased thirst
* Increased serum potassium levels
* Urinary tract infections
* Increased urine output
* Vulvovaginal pruritus (itching)
* Increased hemoglobin levels
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Asthenia (weakness)
* Limb injury

Less common but serious side effects include acute kidney injury, ketoacidosis, necrotizing fasciitis (a severe infection),  pancreatitis, and severe hypersensitivity reactions.  Any concerning side effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Canagliflozin works by inhibiting sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), a protein in the kidneys.  SGLT2 is responsible for reabsorbing glucose from the urine back into the bloodstream. By blocking SGLT2, canagliflozin prevents this reabsorption, leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine. This, in turn, lowers blood glucose levels.  The mechanism also involves impacting sodium reabsorption, potentially influencing blood pressure and kidney function.

### Precautions
Canagliflozin is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Severe hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis or angioedema) to canagliflozin or its components.
* Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) requiring glycemic control.
* End-stage renal disease or those on dialysis.


Canagliflozin should be used with caution in patients with a history of:

* Bone fractures
* Genital mycotic infections
* Hypotension
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
* Ketoacidosis
* Lower limb amputation
* Acute kidney injury
* Urinary tract infections, including urosepsis and pyelonephritis
* Volume depletion

It's important to monitor kidney function, blood pressure, potassium levels, and blood glucose regularly during treatment.  Canagliflozin may interact with other medications, so inform your doctor of all medications you're taking.  It's not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and breastfeeding is discouraged due to unknown excretion in breast milk.  Consult a healthcare provider before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have any pre-existing conditions.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Canagliflozin with other medications?** A:  Canagliflozin can interact with other medications, especially those affecting kidney function, blood glucose, or blood pressure. Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.


* **Q: How should I store Canagliflozin?** A: Store Canagliflozin tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.


* **Q: Can Canagliflozin cause weight loss?** A:  Increased urinary glucose excretion can lead to some weight loss, but this isn't the primary purpose of the medication.


* **Q:  Is Canagliflozin safe for people with heart problems?** A: While it can improve cardiovascular outcomes in *some* patients with type 2 diabetes and established heart disease, it's crucial to discuss its use with a doctor if you have pre-existing heart conditions.
