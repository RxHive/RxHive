# Canagliflozin

**Generic Name:** Canagliflozin

**Usage:**

Canagliflozin is used along with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's specifically used to:

* **Lower blood sugar:**  It works by increasing the amount of sugar removed from the body through the urine.
* **Reduce cardiovascular risk (in certain patients):**  Studies have shown it can reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and cardiovascular events in some patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.  This benefit is not seen in all patients.
* **Reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (in certain patients):** Similar to the above point, this benefit is primarily observed in patients with established cardiovascular disease or those at high risk.

**Note:** Canagliflozin is *not* used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):**  Increased urination can make you more susceptible to UTIs.
* **Increased urination:** This is a common effect due to its mechanism of action.  This can lead to dehydration, especially if you don't drink enough fluids.
* **Dehydration:**  A consequence of increased urination.
* **Yeast infections (candidiasis):** Particularly vaginal yeast infections in women.
* **Leg cramps:**  Muscle cramps are a potential side effect.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** Although less common, it's possible.
* **Ketoacidosis:** In rare cases, particularly if severely dehydrated or ill.  This is a serious complication.


Less common but serious side effects include:

* **Amputation:** Increased risk of lower limb amputation (toes, foot, leg) reported in some clinical trials. This risk appears to be higher with higher doses, so dosing should be carefully considered.
* **Acute kidney injury:**  Canagliflozin can affect kidney function, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.


**How it Works:**

Canagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor.  It works in the kidneys by blocking the reabsorption of glucose from the bloodstream back into the body.  This means more glucose is excreted in the urine, leading to lower blood sugar levels.  It also has other effects that contribute to its cardiovascular benefits, including reducing blood volume and blood pressure.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I take Canagliflozin with other medications?**  You should always discuss all your medications (including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements) with your doctor before starting Canagliflozin.  Interactions are possible with certain medications.
* **Should I drink more water while taking Canagliflozin?** Yes, it's important to stay well-hydrated because of the increased urination.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.
* **Can I take Canagliflozin if I have kidney disease?** Canagliflozin may not be suitable for people with severe kidney disease. Your doctor will need to assess your kidney function before prescribing it.
* **Can I stop taking Canagliflozin suddenly?**  No, you should not stop taking Canagliflozin suddenly.  Talk to your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.
* **What are the signs of ketoacidosis?** Symptoms of ketoacidosis include excessive thirst, frequent urination, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, confusion, and fruity-smelling breath.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
