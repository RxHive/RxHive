# Conivaptan
### Generic Name
Conivaptan

### Usage
Conivaptan is a medication used to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized adults with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.  This means it's used for people with low sodium levels in their blood who have normal or increased fluid volume in their bodies. It's specifically indicated for patients whose low sodium is causing symptoms.  It's important to note that conivaptan has not been proven effective in treating the signs and symptoms of heart failure itself, even if heart failure contributes to the hyponatremia.

### Dosage

**Adults (Euvolemic or Hypervolemic Hyponatremia):** Conivaptan is administered intravenously (IV).

* **Loading Dose:** 20 mg infused over 30 minutes.
* **Maintenance Infusion:**  A continuous infusion of 20 mg over 24 hours (approximately 0.83 mg/hour) for 2-4 days.
* **Dose Adjustment:** The daily dose may be increased to a maximum of 40 mg over 24 hours (approximately 1.7 mg/hour) if the serum sodium level doesn't increase sufficiently.  If a 40mg/24hr dose is needed, this can be given as two 20mg doses, 12 hours apart.
* **Maximum Duration:** Treatment should not exceed 4 days.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) don't require dose adjustments.  Those with moderate or severe impairment (Child-Pugh class B and C) should receive a lower dose (10mg loading dose, followed by 10mg/24hr continuous infusion, potentially increased to 20mg/24hr), and should be carefully monitored.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 mL/min or greater. Conivaptan is not recommended for patients with CrCl less than 30 mL/min, and is contraindicated in patients with anuria (no urine production).

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of conivaptan in children have not been established.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing)
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling, phlebitis)
* Fever


**Less Common but Important Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% of patients or reported post-marketing):**

* Headache, insomnia, confusion
* Hypertension (high blood pressure), hypotension, peripheral edema
* Pruritus (itching), erythema (redness)
* Hyponatremia (low sodium â€“ paradoxical effect requiring close monitoring), increased thirst, hypomagnesemia, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, dehydration
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dry mouth, oral thrush
* Urinary tract infection, hematuria (blood in urine)
* Anemia
* Polyuria (increased urination)
* Pneumonia, pharyngolaryngeal pain
* Atrial arrhythmia, sepsis


If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Conivaptan is a vasopressin receptor antagonist. Vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) is a hormone that helps the kidneys retain water.  Conivaptan blocks the action of vasopressin on the V2 receptor in the kidneys. By doing this, it increases the excretion of water from the body without significantly affecting the excretion of electrolytes like sodium. This helps to correct the imbalance of sodium in the blood and raise serum sodium levels.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Conivaptan is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to conivaptan or its components.
* Hypovolemic hyponatremia (low sodium levels with low fluid volume).
* Anuria (absence of urine production).
* Concurrent use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, clarithromycin).
* Known allergy to corn or corn products.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of infusion site reactions, osmotic demyelination syndrome, hypovolemia, and hypotension.  Close monitoring is essential.
* Use with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
* Conivaptan may interact with other medications. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about any other medications you are taking.
*  Closely monitor serum sodium levels and neurological status during treatment. Rapid increases in serum sodium can be dangerous.
*  Patients should be well hydrated before starting conivaptan.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is conivaptan stored?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.  Generally, it needs to be stored at a controlled room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Can I take conivaptan with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Conivaptan is administered intravenously in a hospital setting; missed doses should be addressed by your healthcare team.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The response time varies, and the effectiveness should be monitored closely through serum sodium level measurement.
* **Q: Is conivaptan safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: Conivaptan is categorized as pregnancy Category C.  The risk to the fetus is unknown. Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking conivaptan.  Discuss any concerns regarding pregnancy or breastfeeding with your doctor.
