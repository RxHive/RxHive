# Coccidioides immitis antigen
### Generic Name
Coccidioides immitis antigen

### Usage

Coccidioides immitis antigen is a diagnostic agent, not a treatment. It's used to detect a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to *Coccidioides immitis*, the fungus that causes coccidioidomycosis (valley fever).  This test helps determine if someone has been exposed to and developed an immune response to the fungus, particularly helpful in individuals aged 18-64 with a history of pulmonary coccidioidomycosis.  The test doesn't diagnose active infection; further testing is needed to confirm an active case of coccidioidomycosis.

### Dosage

**Coccidioides immitis skin test antigen:**

* **Adults (18-64 years with history of pulmonary coccidioidomycosis):** 0.1 mL administered intradermally into the volar surface of the forearm using a tuberculin syringe with a Â½-inch, 26- or 27-gauge needle.  Repeat administration hasn't been evaluated. A positive reaction is indicated by induration (hardening) of 5 mm or more (typically 5-10 mm) in diameter, measured 48 hours after administration. An immediate reaction (15 minutes to 1 hour, lasting up to 24 hours) isn't considered a positive result.

* **Children:** Safety and efficacy haven't been established in children.

* **Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for hepatic or renal impairment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (incidence >10%):

* Itching at the injection site
* Swelling at the injection site
* Pain at the injection site

Less common side effects (incidence 1-10%):

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Increased heart rate
* Skin ulceration at the injection site
* Gastrointestinal symptoms
* Erythema (redness) at the injection site
* Injection-site reaction
* Weakness
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Flu-like symptoms
* Cough

**Serious but less common:** Systemic hypersensitivity reactions, which can be life-threatening. Immediate medical attention is required if such reactions occur.

### How it Works

The Coccidioides immitis antigen elicits a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction.  When injected intradermally, the antigen interacts with T-lymphocytes (CD4 and CD8 cells) that have been sensitized to *Coccidioides immitis*. This interaction triggers a cascade of events involving the release of interleukins and other lymphokines from macrophages. These molecules increase blood vessel permeability, allowing fibrinogen to escape into the surrounding tissue where it converts to fibrin.  The accumulation of fibrin, T-cells, and monocytes leads to the localized swelling (induration) observed as a positive test result.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to Coccidioides immitis skin test, any component of the formulation, or other coccidioidin products.
* **Increased Risk:**  Hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
* **Warnings:**  The skin test should only be administered intradermally. Immunosuppressants (except liposomal cytarabine) may diminish the test's diagnostic effect, leading to false-negative results.  Patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes after injection for hypersensitivity reactions. Emergency measures and trained personnel must be readily available due to the potential for life-threatening reactions.  This test does *not* diagnose active coccidioidomycosis; further investigations are necessary for active infection diagnosis.  Pregnancy Category C: Use with caution during pregnancy and lactation as excretion in breast milk is unknown.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from the Coccidioides immitis skin test?**
    * **A:** The test site is assessed for induration (hardening) 48 hours after injection.

* **Q: What does a positive test result mean?**
    * **A:**  It indicates prior exposure to and sensitization to *Coccidioides immitis*, suggesting past infection. It does not confirm current infection.

* **Q: What does a negative test result mean?**
    * **A:** It may indicate a lack of prior exposure or a weakened immune response.  It doesn't rule out current infection.

* **Q: How is the test administered?**
    * **A:** The test is administered via intradermal injection into the forearm using a tuberculin syringe.

* **Q: How should I store the antigen?**
    * **A:** Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific storage recommendations.  Generally, refrigeration is required.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a severe reaction?**
    * **A:** Seek immediate medical attention.
