# Cenobamate
### Generic Name
Cenobamate

### Usage
Cenobamate is an anticonvulsant medication primarily used to treat partial-onset seizures in adults.  Partial-onset seizures originate in one area of the brain and can spread to other areas.  Cenobamate helps to control these seizures by reducing the abnormal electrical activity in the brain that causes them. Currently, it's not approved for use in children or for other types of seizures.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Focal/Partial-Onset Seizures):** Cenobamate is administered orally.  The dosage is carefully titrated upwards over several weeks to minimize side effects.  The typical starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily for the first two weeks. This is then increased gradually, usually by 12.5 mg every two weeks, to reach a maintenance dose of 200 mg once daily.  Based on clinical response and tolerability, the dose may be increased further, up to a maximum of 400 mg once daily, in 50 mg increments every two weeks.  Stopping Cenobamate should be done gradually over at least two weeks, and ideally, over 2-6 months for long-term users, to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency or withdrawal symptoms.  A healthcare provider will guide you through the appropriate titration schedule and withdrawal process.


**Pediatric Dosage:** Cenobamate's safety and effectiveness have not been established in children.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary in individuals with certain conditions:

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Cenobamate should be used cautiously in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B), and dose reduction may be considered. It's not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 90 mL/min or higher. However, caution is advised, and dose reduction may be necessary in patients with CrCl below 90 mL/min.  Cenobamate is not recommended for individuals with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness)
* Lethargy
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* ECG abnormalities
* Increased serum potassium levels
* Diplopia (double vision)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less of patients):**

* Suicidal thoughts or behavior
* Severe allergic reactions (DRESS syndrome) characterized by fever, rash, swollen face, and organ damage.
* QT interval shortening on ECG (can lead to potentially fatal heart rhythm problems).
* Neurological problems:  Ataxia (lack of coordination), confusion, amnesia, gait abnormalities, etc.
* Gastrointestinal issues: Nausea, vomiting, constipation, etc.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported immediately to a doctor.

### How it Works

The exact way Cenobamate works to control seizures isn't completely understood. However, it's known to affect the activity of voltage-gated sodium channels in neurons (brain cells), reducing their ability to fire excessively.  It also acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, enhancing the effects of the neurotransmitter GABA, which inhibits neuronal activity. These combined effects help to reduce the abnormal electrical discharges in the brain that cause seizures.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Cenobamate should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to cenobamate or any of its components.
* **QT Prolongation:** Cenobamate can shorten the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG). This effect is usually not clinically significant. Patients with a known short QT interval or family history of short QT syndrome should avoid using Cenobamate.
* **Drug Interactions:** Cenobamate interacts with many other medications. It can affect the levels of other anti-seizure drugs, oral contraceptives, and other medications metabolized through the CYP2B6 and CYP3A or CYP2C19 enzyme systems.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  There is limited information about the safety of cenobamate during pregnancy. Animal studies suggest potential harm to the fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment.  It's unknown whether cenobamate passes into breast milk. The benefits and risks of breastfeeding while using Cenobamate need to be weighed carefully.
* **Suicidal Ideation:**  Suicidal thoughts or behavior have been reported with Cenobamate.  Careful monitoring is necessary, especially during initial treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Cenobamate with or without food?** A: Cenobamate can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store Cenobamate?** A: Store Cenobamate at room temperature away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Cenobamate suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping Cenobamate suddenly can lead to increased seizure frequency.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually reducing the dose.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q:  Can I drive while taking Cenobamate?** A:  Drowsiness and dizziness are common side effects of Cenobamate. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medication affects you.  Always consult with your doctor before making decisions about driving or other activities that require alertness.
