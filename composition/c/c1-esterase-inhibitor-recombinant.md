# C1 Esterase Inhibitor Recombinant
### Generic Name
C1 Esterase Inhibitor Recombinant (Conestat Alfa)

### Usage
C1 esterase inhibitor (recombinant), also known as conestat alfa, is primarily indicated for treating acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adult and adolescent patients (13 years and older).  While its primary use is treating acute attacks, it's also used off-label for prophylaxis (prevention) of HAE attacks.  Hereditary angioedema is a rare genetic disorder causing swelling in different body parts due to a deficiency or dysfunction of C1 esterase inhibitor, a protein that regulates the inflammatory response.

### Dosage

**Adults (≥18 years):**

* **Treatment of Acute HAE Attacks:**  For patients weighing less than 84 kg, the intravenous (IV) dose is 50 units/kg (maximum dose: 4200 units) as a single dose.  For patients weighing 84 kg or more, the IV dose is 4200 units as a single dose. If symptoms persist, one additional dose may be given, but no more than two doses within 24 hours.

* **Prophylaxis (Off-Label):** For patients weighing less than 84 kg, the IV dose is 50 units/kg (maximum dose: 4200 units) twice weekly. For patients weighing 84 kg or more, the IV dose is 4200 units twice weekly. The frequency may be reduced to once weekly if symptom control is maintained.

**Adolescents (13-17 years):**  The dosage is the same as for adults.

**Children (<13 years):**  The dosage information for children under 13 years is not available in the provided data.  Always consult a doctor before administering any medication to a child.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment based on the available manufacturer's labeling.


**Administration:** The medication is administered intravenously (IV) as a slow injection over approximately 5 minutes.  It must be reconstituted according to the manufacturer's instructions using sterile water for injection (SWFI).


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (frequency ≥10% or 1-10%):**

* Antibody development (immunologic)
* Headache, vertigo (nervous system)
* Diarrhea, nausea (gastrointestinal)
* Burning sensation of the skin, erythema (redness) (dermatologic)
* Increased C-reactive protein, increased serum fibrinogen (fibrin D-dimer), lipoma (hematologic and oncologic)
* Angioedema (hypersensitivity)
* Back pain (neuromuscular and skeletal)
* Sneezing (respiratory)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Abdominal pain
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Skin rash

**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

C1 esterase inhibitor (recombinant) is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin). It works by regulating the activation of the complement and contact systems, key parts of the body's inflammatory response.  Specifically, it inactivates plasma kallikrein and factor XIIa, preventing the overproduction of bradykinin, a molecule that contributes significantly to the swelling seen in HAE attacks. By suppressing these pathways, it helps reduce vascular permeability and alleviates the symptoms of HAE.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  C1 esterase inhibitor (recombinant) is contraindicated in patients with a history of immediate hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) to C1 esterase inhibitor preparations and in those with known or suspected allergy to rabbits and rabbit-derived products.

* **Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria, hives, chest tightness, wheezing, hypotension, anaphylaxis) and serious arterial and venous thromboembolic events (blood clots).

* **Drug Interactions:** Androgens, estrogen derivatives, and progestins may enhance the thrombogenic (blood clotting) effect of C1 esterase inhibitors. Careful monitoring is needed if these are used concurrently.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  It is categorized as Pregnancy Category B.  However, C1 inhibitor (human) is generally preferred during pregnancy and lactation for HAE management. Close monitoring is necessary during pregnancy and for at least 72 hours postpartum.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised when administering to breastfeeding women.

* **Other Precautions:**  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as they may interact with conestat alfa.
