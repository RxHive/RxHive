# Calcitriol
### Generic Name
Calcitriol

### Usage
Calcitriol is a synthetic form of vitamin D3, primarily used to treat conditions related to calcium and phosphorus imbalances in the body.  Its main applications include:

* **Secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD):**  In CKD, the kidneys don't produce enough calcitriol, leading to an imbalance in calcium and phosphorus levels and potentially causing hyperparathyroidism (overactive parathyroid glands). Calcitriol helps restore these balances.  This is often used in conjunction with dialysis.

* **Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium):** Calcitriol can be used to treat hypocalcemia resulting from various causes, including post-surgical hypoparathyroidism (underactive parathyroid glands after surgery), idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (underactive parathyroid glands of unknown cause), and pseudohypoparathyroidism (resistance to parathyroid hormone).

* **Psoriasis (topical application):**  Calcitriol is also available as a topical ointment, applied directly to the skin, for the treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis in adults.  This use is separate from its systemic use to manage calcium levels.  Note that its use in pediatric patients for psoriasis is not established.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, and overall health, and the route of administration (oral or intravenous for systemic use; topical for psoriasis). Always follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  The following are general examples and should not be considered a substitute for personalized medical advice.

**Adult Dosage (Systemic):**

* **Secondary hyperparathyroidism (oral):**  Typically starts at 0.25 mcg/day, adjusted upwards every 4-8 weeks based on response, up to a maximum of 0.5-1 mcg/day.  In some cases, a lower dose given every other day may suffice.
* **Secondary hyperparathyroidism (IV):** Usually initiated at 1-2 mcg/day two times a week (alternating days) or, potentially,  0.5-4 mcg/day three times a week. Dosage adjustments are made in increments of 0.5-1 mcg/dose every 2-4 weeks.
* **Hypocalcemia (oral):**  Begins at 0.25 mcg/day, often increasing by 0.5-2 mcg/day at 2-4 week intervals as needed.

**Pediatric Dosage (Systemic):**  Dosage is generally lower for children and is strictly based on weight and the specific condition.  It is extremely important to get specific instructions from a healthcare professional.  Topical use in children for psoriasis is not established.

**Topical Dosage (Psoriasis):** Apply a thin layer of Calcitriol ointment to the affected area twice daily. The maximum weekly dose should not exceed 200 grams.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Systemic):**

* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) â€“ this is a serious side effect requiring immediate medical attention.
* Headache
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash
* Polydipsia (excessive thirst)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Systemic):**

* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Hypertension
* Seizures
* Pancreatitis
* Renal stones (more common with topical application)

**Common Side Effects (Topical):**

* Skin irritation
* Burning
* Itching
* Psoriasis flare-up (paradoxically)


**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any side effects, even seemingly minor ones, consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Calcitriol is an active form of vitamin D. It works by binding to receptors in the intestines, kidneys, and bones. This binding action increases:

* Calcium absorption from the intestines.
* Calcium reabsorption by the kidneys.
* Calcium release from bones (this is carefully controlled and usually beneficial in the context of specific diseases it's prescribed for).
* Phosphate reabsorption by the kidneys.

By influencing calcium and phosphate levels, Calcitriol helps regulate parathyroid hormone production and contributes to maintaining healthy bone structure and function.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Calcitriol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or its components, hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels), vitamin D toxicity, or evidence of metastatic calcification (abnormal calcium deposits in tissues).
* **Interactions:**  Calcitriol can interact with several medications, including those affecting calcium, phosphate, or vitamin D metabolism.  Some medications might increase or decrease Calcitriol's effects. Discuss all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies with your doctor before starting Calcitriol.
* **Renal Impairment:** Use caution in patients with impaired kidney function.  Close monitoring of calcium and phosphate levels is crucial.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Calcitriol is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning potential risks to the fetus haven't been fully established.  It passes into breast milk in small amounts. Consult a physician before using Calcitriol if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  Monitor serum calcium and phosphorus regularly.  Adequate hydration is important. Dietary adjustments might be needed to manage calcium and phosphorus intake.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Calcitriol with other medications?** A: It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: How should I store Calcitriol?** A: Store Calcitriol as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see improvements varies depending on the condition being treated and individual response. Regular monitoring is essential.

* **Q: Are there any long-term side effects?** A: Long-term use might increase the risk of hypercalcemia or other complications. Regular checkups and monitoring are important to manage potential risks.
