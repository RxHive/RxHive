# Ceftolozane + Tazobactam
### Generic Name
Ceftolozane + Tazobactam

### Usage

Ceftolozane and Tazobactam is a combination antibiotic used to treat several serious bacterial infections.  Its primary use is in treating complicated intra-abdominal infections (often in combination with metronidazole), complicated urinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis), and hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia.  It's also sometimes used off-label for serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, such as skin and soft tissue infections and bloodstream infections.  The specific use and necessity of combination therapy will always be determined by a physician considering the individual patient's condition and the specific bacteria causing the infection.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the infection being treated, the patient's renal function, and the chosen administration route (intravenous infusion only).  The following information is for guidance only and should not replace the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Adults:**

* **Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (with metronidazole):** Typically 1.5 g (1 g Ceftolozane + 0.5 g Tazobactam) every 8 hours for 4-14 days.
* **Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (including pyelonephritis):** Typically 1.5 g (1 g Ceftolozane + 0.5 g Tazobactam) every 8 hours for 7 days.
* **Hospital-Acquired or Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia:**  Typically 3 g every 8 hours for 7 days (but the duration may vary).
* **Serious Infections due to multidrug-resistant *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (off-label):**  1.5-3 g every 8 hours;  3 g every 8 hours is often recommended for pulmonary infections.

**Dosage Adjustments for Renal Impairment:**  Dosage reduction is necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (creatinine clearance, CrCl).  This adjustment is crucial to prevent drug accumulation and potential toxicity. Specific dosage adjustments based on CrCl levels are provided by the prescribing physician or found in the medication's official prescribing information.  Patients undergoing hemodialysis require a specific loading dose followed by a maintenance dose administered after dialysis.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Ceftolozane/Tazobactam in children have not been established.

**Administration:**  Ceftolozane/Tazobactam is administered intravenously (IV) by infusion over one hour.  Never administer this medication via any other route.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients in some studies) may include:

* Positive direct Coombs test (a blood test)
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (serum transaminases)

Less common but potentially serious side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients in some studies) can include:

* Headache, dizziness, insomnia, anxiety
* Hypotension (low blood pressure), atrial fibrillation
* Skin rash
* Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation
* Anemia, thrombocythemia (increased platelet count)
* Increased levels of various liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP)
* Renal insufficiency or failure


Rare side effects reported during post-marketing surveillance or in case reports are numerous and encompass various body systems.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Ceftolozane is a cephalosporin antibiotic that works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.  Tazobactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor, which means it prevents certain enzymes produced by bacteria (beta-lactamases) from breaking down Ceftolozane. This combination makes Ceftolozane more effective against bacteria that produce these enzymes and would otherwise be resistant to it.

### Precautions

* **Allergy:**  This medication is contraindicated (absolutely not to be used) in individuals with known severe allergies to Ceftolozane, Tazobactam, other beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams), or any components of the formulation.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics should be closely monitored for allergic reactions.
* **Superinfection:**  Like other antibiotics, Ceftolozane/Tazobactam can disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in the body, potentially leading to overgrowth of other microorganisms (superinfection), including *Clostridium difficile* which can cause severe diarrhea.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are crucial for patients with reduced kidney function.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Though dosage adjustment is usually not needed, liver function should be monitored.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Ceftolozane/Tazobactam is a pregnancy category B drug.  Consult with your healthcare provider about the risks and benefits before using this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ceftolozane/Tazobactam can interact with other medications, including aminoglycosides, probenecid, and vitamin K antagonists (like warfarin).  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Ceftolozane/Tazobactam to work?** A:  The time it takes to see improvement depends on the infection and individual response, but improvement is usually seen within a few days.  However, complete treatment is crucial and should be followed as prescribed, even if you feel better sooner.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Ceftolozane/Tazobactam?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while on this medication unless your doctor advises otherwise. Alcohol can interact with some medications.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for instructions on how to proceed.  Do not double up on doses.
