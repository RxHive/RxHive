# Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum
### Generic Name
Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum

### Usage

Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum is primarily used to treat Dupuytren's contracture in adults.  This condition causes a thickening and shortening of the tissue in the palm of the hand, leading to bent fingers that cannot be straightened.  The medication is injected directly into the affected cord of tissue.  

A secondary, albeit important, use is in the treatment of Peyronie's disease in adult males.  Peyronie's disease involves the development of scar tissue (plaque) in the penis, causing curvature and pain during erection.  In this context, the medication is injected directly into the plaque.  It's crucial to note that this is a complex treatment that requires a skilled healthcare professional's guidance and typically involves multiple injections and penile modeling procedures.


### Dosage

**Dupuytren's Contracture:**

*   **Adults:** 0.58 mg is injected into the palpable cord affecting either the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint or the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. Only one cord is injected at a time.  If contracture persists 24-72 hours after injection, a finger extension procedure is performed by a healthcare professional to help disrupt the cord.  The injection and extension procedure may be repeated up to three times per cord at 4-week intervals. If multiple cords are affected, they are treated sequentially.  For injections on the same hand during a single visit, separate vials and syringes are necessary.

*   **Children:** The safety and efficacy of collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum have not been established in children.

**Peyronie's Disease:**

*   **Adults:** Treatment involves a course of up to four treatment cycles, each consisting of two injections and one penile modeling procedure (a total of eight injections and four modeling procedures maximum). The second injection is given 1-3 days after the first, and the penile modeling procedure is performed 1-3 days after the second injection.  The interval between treatment cycles is approximately 6 weeks.  A penile erection is induced (often using alprostadil) before identifying and marking the injection site.  0.58 mg is injected into each plaque on two separate days, 1-3 days apart. If the curvature deformity is less than 15 degrees after the first, second, or third cycle, or further treatment is deemed unnecessary, subsequent cycles are not administered.

*   **Children:**  The safety and efficacy of collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum have not been established in children.

**Important Note:**  Dosage and treatment plans should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on the individual's specific condition and response to treatment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in >10% of patients):**

*   **Dupuytren's Contracture:** Peripheral edema (swelling), contusion (bruising), injection site hemorrhage (bleeding), injection site reaction, pain in the injected extremity, itching (pruritus), and lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes).

*   **Peyronie's Disease:** Penile hematoma (blood clot), swelling, pain, and ecchymoses (bruises).

**Less Common Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

*   **Dupuytren's Contracture:** Skin laceration (cuts), lymph node pain, erythema (redness), and axillary pain (pain in the armpit).

*   **Peyronie's Disease:** Blood blisters, penile blisters, genital itching, painful erection, erectile dysfunction, procedural pain, injection site vesicles (small fluid-filled blisters), localized edema, dyspareunia (painful intercourse), injection site itching, nodules, and suprapubic pain (pain above the pubic bone).

**Rare Side Effects (Occurring in <1% of patients):**

*   **Peyronie's Disease:** Corporal rupture (penile fracture).

If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe or persistent ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum contains two forms of collagenase enzymes. These enzymes break down collagen, a protein that forms the structural basis of the Dupuytren's contracture cord and Peyronie's disease plaque. By breaking down this collagen, the medication helps to loosen and disrupt the contracted tissue, allowing for improved finger extension (Dupuytren's) or penile straightening (Peyronie's) with additional therapeutic procedures.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:**  Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the medication. In Peyronie's disease, it's contraindicated if the plaque involves the penile urethra or if injection into the urethra, nerves, blood vessels, corpora cavernosa, or other collagen-containing structures of the penis is a risk.

*   **Interactions:** Use with caution in patients receiving anticoagulants (except low-dose aspirin) as it may increase the risk of bleeding.

*   **Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, tendon rupture, or other serious injuries to the injected extremity. In Peyronie's disease, there's a risk of corporal rupture (penile fracture) or other serious penile injuries.  Use with caution in patients with coagulation disorders.

*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum is categorized as Pregnancy Category B.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  Results vary, but improvement is usually seen within a few days of injection, particularly after the finger extension procedure for Dupuytren's contracture. Peyronie's disease treatment is a longer process involving multiple cycles.

*   **Q: How is the medication stored?** A:  Store according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically refrigerated.

*   **Q: Are there any specific activities to avoid after treatment?** A:  Avoid strenuous activity and follow your healthcare provider's instructions regarding splinting and hand elevation (Dupuytren's). For Peyronie's, avoid sexual activity for a period following the injection cycles as advised.

*   **Q:  What if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately.  Do not attempt to adjust the dosage or treatment schedule without their guidance.

*   **Q: Is this treatment suitable for everyone with Dupuytren's or Peyronie's?** A:  No, suitability depends on individual factors and the severity of the condition. Your healthcare provider will assess your specific needs and determine if this treatment is appropriate.  The presence of specific contraindications must be reviewed.
