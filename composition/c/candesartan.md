# Candesartan
### Generic Name
Candesartan

### Usage

Candesartan is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by relaxing blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily, and thereby lowering blood pressure.  This helps reduce the risk of serious complications like stroke, heart attack, and kidney disease associated with uncontrolled hypertension.

Beyond hypertension, Candesartan also plays a role in managing heart failure, particularly in patients with a reduced ejection fraction (the amount of blood the heart pumps out with each beat) and classified as NYHA class II-IV (New York Heart Association classification of heart failure severity). In these cases, it helps improve the heart's ability to pump blood and reduces symptoms of heart failure.  It's important to note that Candesartan is sometimes used off-label in other conditions like acute coronary syndromes and proteinuric chronic kidney disease (both diabetic and non-diabetic), but these uses require careful medical supervision.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and their response to the medication.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

**Adults:**

* **Hypertension:** The starting dose is typically 16 mg once daily. The doctor may adjust this upwards to 32 mg daily based on response, usually in increments over 4-6 weeks.  The maximum dose is 32 mg daily.
* **Heart Failure:**  Treatment begins with a lower dose (4-8 mg once daily), gradually increasing at two-week intervals, depending on response and tolerability. The maximum dose here is also 32 mg daily.
* **Acute Coronary Syndromes (off-label):**  Treatment begins with 8 mg once daily, and may be increased up to 32 mg daily under close medical supervision.  Hemodynamic stability is crucial before initiating this treatment.
* **Proteinuric Chronic Kidney Disease (off-label):** The initial dose is typically 8 mg once daily, and can increase to 32 mg daily based on blood pressure and proteinuria levels.


**Children:**  Candesartan dosage for children is determined by weight and age and is carefully managed by a physician. It is typically lower than adult dosages.  Precise dosing information should be obtained directly from a pediatrician.


**Administration:** Candesartan is usually administered orally, as a tablet.  It can generally be taken with or without food.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.  People with severe liver or kidney impairment should generally avoid Candesartan.

### Side Effects

Like many medications, Candesartan can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Upper respiratory tract infections (common cold symptoms)
* Back pain
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Renal dysfunction (kidney problems)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) â€“ this is a medical emergency requiring immediate attention.
*  Severe allergic reactions.
*  Changes in liver function tests.

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Candesartan belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Angiotensin II is a hormone that narrows blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. Candesartan works by blocking the action of angiotensin II on specific receptors in the body. This prevents the blood vessels from constricting, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and reducing blood pressure. Additionally, it also reduces the effects of aldosterone, a hormone that influences fluid and salt balance.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Candesartan is contraindicated during pregnancy, as it can cause serious harm to the developing fetus.  If pregnancy occurs while taking Candesartan, stop taking the medication immediately and consult your doctor.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Candesartan is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Individuals with severe kidney disease should avoid Candesartan, and those with moderate impairment may require dosage adjustments.
* **Liver Disease:** Similar precautions apply to individuals with severe liver disease.
* **Interactions:**  Candesartan can interact with other medications, including other blood pressure medications, potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs, and certain other drugs.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Anyone with a known allergy to Candesartan or similar medications should avoid its use.
* **Hypotension:**  Candesartan can cause low blood pressure (hypotension).  Monitor for symptoms like dizziness or lightheadedness, especially when starting treatment.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Candesartan suddenly?** A: No.  Always consult your doctor before stopping Candesartan, as sudden cessation can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.

* **Q: How should I store Candesartan?** A: Store Candesartan at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is Candesartan habit-forming?** A: No, Candesartan is not habit-forming.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking Candesartan?** A: Excessive alcohol consumption can lower blood pressure, so moderate alcohol intake is recommended while taking Candesartan. Discuss any concerns with your doctor.
