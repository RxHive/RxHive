# Candesartan

**Generic Name:** Candesartan Cilexetil

**Usage:**

Candesartan cilexetil is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) used to treat:

* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  It helps lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney disease.  It can be used alone or in combination with other blood pressure medications.
* **Heart failure:** It can improve survival and reduce hospitalizations in patients with heart failure.
* **Diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease in patients with diabetes):** It slows the progression of kidney damage in patients with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Upper respiratory infection
* Diarrhea
* Back pain
* Muscle cramps

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels):** This can be dangerous, especially for people with kidney problems.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** Can cause dizziness or fainting.
* **Kidney problems:** Worsening of existing kidney disease.
* **Cough:** Less common than with ACE inhibitors.
* **Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat):** This is a rare but serious allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:**

Candesartan cilexetil blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels and raises blood pressure. By blocking angiotensin II, candesartan cilexetil helps relax and widen blood vessels, lowering blood pressure and reducing strain on the heart.  This also helps to reduce the workload on the kidneys in patients with diabetic nephropathy.
