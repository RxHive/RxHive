# Clevidipine
### Generic Name
Clevidipine

### Usage
Clevidipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker used primarily to lower blood pressure in situations where oral medication isn't feasible or desirable.  This is typically in critical care settings, such as during surgery or in the intensive care unit (ICU), for the management of hypertension (high blood pressure).  It's a short-acting agent, making it useful for managing blood pressure acutely and temporarily.  There are no notable secondary uses outside of acute blood pressure control.

### Dosage
Clevidipine is administered intravenously (IV) as a continuous infusion.  Dosage is highly individualized and titrated based on the patient's response, typically aiming for a target blood pressure.

**Adults:** The initial dose is typically 1-2 mg/hour, with the infusion rate doubled every 90 seconds until the desired blood pressure is achieved.  Subsequent adjustments are made in smaller increments (every 5-10 minutes). Maintenance doses often range from 4-6 mg/hour.  However, the maximum recommended dose is 500 mg/day or 21 mg/hour due to limitations related to the lipid content of the formulation.  Most patients will require doses less than or equal to 16 mg/hour.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of clevidipine in children have not been established.  Therefore, it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dose adjustments are typically needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment at the initiation of the infusion, although close monitoring of blood pressure and potential side effects is essential.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Insomnia
* Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat)
* Nausea
* Fever
* Headache
* Vomiting

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Post-procedural hemorrhage (bleeding after a procedure)
* Acute renal failure (kidney failure)
* Pneumonia
* Respiratory failure
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Syncope (fainting)
* Reflex tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
* Increased serum triglyceride levels
* Allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity

**Important:** Any concerning side effects, even if not listed here, should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Clevidipine works by blocking the entry of calcium ions into arterial smooth muscle cells. Calcium ions play a crucial role in the contraction of these muscles. By inhibiting calcium influx, clevidipine causes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing systemic vascular resistance and consequently lowering blood pressure.  It's a potent arterial vasodilator, primarily affecting arterioles, resulting in a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP).

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Clevidipine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components,  severe aortic stenosis, and those with defective lipid metabolism (e.g., severe hyperlipidemia, lipoid nephrosis, or acute pancreatitis if accompanied by hyperlipidemia).  Also avoid in patients with known allergies to soybeans, soy products, egg yolk, or egg products as the formulation includes these components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Clevidipine can interact with numerous other medications, including other antihypertensives, alpha-1 blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, calcium salts, certain antidepressants (MAOIs), and others. Concomitant use of these medications can significantly impact blood pressure, potentially leading to excessive hypotension or other adverse effects. Consult a physician regarding potential interactions with any medications a patient is already taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Clevidipine is classified as Pregnancy Category C.  While it may be used to manage hypertension during pregnancy,  other agents are often preferred due to the IV infusion requirement.  Clevidipine's excretion in breast milk is unknown. 
* **Specific Populations:**  Close monitoring is crucial in older adults and those with impaired liver or kidney function.  Clevidipine is not recommended for use in children.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for clevidipine to work?** A: Clevidipine has a rapid onset of action, with effects typically seen within minutes of starting the infusion.  However, the duration is short.

* **Q: How is clevidipine stored?** A: Clevidipine should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically at room temperature and protected from light. Once a vial is punctured, it must be used within 12 hours.

* **Q: Can I stop taking clevidipine suddenly?** A: No, sudden cessation of clevidipine can lead to rebound hypertension (a sudden increase in blood pressure). It's crucial to follow the healthcare provider's instructions for gradually tapering the infusion rate as directed.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, even if they seem minor.

* **Q: Is clevidipine suitable for long-term use?** A: Clevidipine is not intended for long-term management of hypertension. Itâ€™s primarily used for short-term, acute blood pressure control in specific clinical situations.
