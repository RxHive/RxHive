# Coenzyme Q + Docosahexanoic Acid + Eicosapentaenoic Acid + Folic Acid + L-Arginine + Levo-carnitine + Lycopene + Methylcobalamin + Selenium + Zinc Gluconate
### Generic Name

Coenzyme Q10 + DHA + EPA + Folic Acid + L-Arginine + L-Carnitine + Lycopene + Methylcobalamin + Selenium + Zinc Gluconate  *(Note: This is a combination product;  there isn't a single generic name for this specific blend.)*


### Usage

This combination product is not a single medicine approved for treating a specific disease by itself. Instead, it's a nutritional supplement designed to support cardiovascular health, cognitive function, and overall well-being.  The individual components address various aspects of these areas:

* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):**  An antioxidant that supports energy production within cells and may help protect against oxidative stress, particularly beneficial for heart health.
* **Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA):** Omega-3 fatty acids crucial for brain function, heart health, and reducing inflammation.
* **Folic Acid:**  An essential B vitamin vital for cell growth and development, especially important during pregnancy.  It also plays a role in cardiovascular health.
* **L-Arginine:** An amino acid that helps produce nitric oxide, contributing to healthy blood vessel function and blood flow.
* **L-Carnitine:**  An amino acid derivative that aids in energy production and fat metabolism.
* **Lycopene:**  A powerful antioxidant found in tomatoes and other red fruits, known for its potential protective effects against certain cancers and cardiovascular disease.
* **Methylcobalamin:**  A form of vitamin B12 essential for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis.
* **Selenium:** A trace mineral with antioxidant properties that supports immune function and thyroid health.
* **Zinc Gluconate:** A form of zinc, a mineral important for immune function, wound healing, and cell growth.


This combination aims to provide synergistic benefits, meaning the combined effect of these nutrients is greater than the sum of their individual effects. However, it's crucial to understand that this product is *not* a replacement for medical treatment of any condition.
