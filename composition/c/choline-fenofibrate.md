# Choline fenofibrate

It's important to note that there is **no generic drug called "Choline Fenofibrate."**  Fenofibrate is a medication used to lower cholesterol and triglycerides. It's available in various brand names and generic forms, but not in combination with choline. Choline is a nutrient, not a medication typically combined with fenofibrate in pharmaceutical preparations.  Therefore, I cannot provide details in the requested format for a non-existent drug.

To clarify, if you're interested in information about:

* **Fenofibrate (generic):** I can provide details on that medication.
* **Choline supplements:** I can provide details on those.

Please specify which information you require.
