# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is a commonly used over-the-counter (OTC) remedy for the relief of symptoms associated with the common cold or the flu.  It typically addresses:

* **Runny nose (rhinorrhea):** Phenylephrine acts as a decongestant, shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages.
* **Cough (cough suppression):** Dextromethorphan is an antitussive (cough suppressant) that works on the cough center in the brain.  It's important to note that it doesn't treat the underlying cause of the cough.
* **Sneezing and watery eyes (rhinitis):** Chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, contributing to these symptoms.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a common side effect of both chlorpheniramine and dextromethorphan.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth:** This is a frequent side effect of antihistamines.
* **Constipation:**  This can occur with some antihistamines.
* **Nausea:**  Less common, but possible.
* **Headache:**  A relatively common side effect.
* **Dizziness:**  Can occur, especially with higher doses.
* **Increased heart rate (tachycardia):**  More likely with phenylephrine.
* **Difficulty sleeping (insomnia):** Especially if taken later in the day.
* **Nervousness or irritability:**  Possible, particularly with phenylephrine.
* **High blood pressure:**  Possible, especially in individuals with pre-existing hypertension.


**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate (antihistamine):** Blocks the action of histamine, reducing symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide (antitussive):** Acts on the brain to suppress the cough reflex.  It doesn't address the underlying cause of the cough.
* **Phenylephrine (decongestant):** Causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
