# Cilostazol
### Generic Name
Cilostazol

### Usage
Cilostazol is primarily used to alleviate the symptoms of intermittent claudication, a condition characterized by leg pain or cramping during exercise due to reduced blood flow in the arteries of the legs.  It improves walking distance by increasing blood flow to the legs.  Importantly,  while not officially FDA-approved for these uses,  cilostazol is sometimes used off-label  following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, a procedure to open blocked coronary arteries) to help prevent further blockages, and in the secondary prevention of noncardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA, a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain).  These off-label uses should only be considered under the strict guidance of a physician.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Intermittent Claudication:**
    * Immediate-release tablets: 100 mg twice daily (BID).
    * Sustained-release tablets: 200 mg once daily (OD).
    * Treatment should be discontinued if symptoms don't improve after three months.

* **Off-label uses (PCI and stroke/TIA prevention):**  Dosage is similar to intermittent claudication, often 100mg BID (immediate-release) or 200mg OD (sustained-release).  Always consult a physician for precise dosage and duration of treatment for these conditions.  In PCI, it's frequently used in combination with aspirin or clopidogrel.

**Pediatric Dosage:**
The safety and effectiveness of cilostazol in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for mild impairment.  For moderate to severe impairment, use with caution; specific dosage adjustments aren't provided in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is generally needed. However, caution is advised in cases of severe renal impairment, as metabolite concentrations may increase.  For patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis, dosage adjustments are not specified in the manufacturer’s labeling, and cilostazol is not dialyzable.
* **CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors:** If taken with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, diltiazem) or CYP2C19 (e.g., ticlopidine, fluconazole, omeprazole), the dose should be reduced to 50 mg BID.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Diarrhea
* Abnormal stools
* Rhinitis (runny nose)
* Infections

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less frequently, but potentially serious):**

* Dizziness, vertigo
* Palpitations, peripheral edema, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat), other cardiac events
* Nausea, dyspepsia (indigestion), abdominal pain
* Skin rash, other dermatological reactions
* Anemia, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), other hematological problems
* Allergic reactions (including angioedema – swelling of face, lips, tongue)
* Liver function abnormalities

**Note:** This list is not exhaustive.  If you experience any concerning side effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Cilostazol inhibits phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE3), an enzyme that breaks down cyclic AMP (cAMP). By inhibiting PDE3, cilostazol increases cAMP levels.  This leads to several beneficial effects:

* **Inhibition of platelet aggregation:**  Reduced clumping of platelets, which helps prevent blood clots.
* **Vasodilation:** Widening of blood vessels, improving blood flow.
* **Inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation:**  Slows down the growth of cells in blood vessel walls, potentially preventing further narrowing of arteries.

These actions collectively contribute to improved blood flow to the legs and reduced symptoms of intermittent claudication and potentially benefit other conditions like post-PCI stenosis and stroke/TIA prevention.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cilostazol is contraindicated in patients with heart failure of any severity.  It should also not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity to cilostazol or its components.
* **Increased Risks:** Cilostazol may increase the risk of cardiovascular events (such as palpitations, abnormal heart rhythms, low blood pressure), and hematological problems (such as low platelet or white blood cell counts). Close monitoring is necessary.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with moderate-to-severe hepatic or severe renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Cilostazol can interact with various medications, including other antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, and some enzyme inhibitors and inducers.  Always inform your physician about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Cilostazol is a Category C drug during pregnancy.  The decision to use it during pregnancy should be carefully weighed against the potential risks.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid use in patients with active pathological bleeding or hemostatic disorders. Concurrent use with grapefruit juice may require dosage adjustment.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for cilostazol to work?** A:  The onset of effects varies, but noticeable improvement in walking distance usually occurs within a few weeks of consistent use.
* **Q: Can I stop taking cilostazol suddenly?** A:  No, you should not stop taking cilostazol abruptly. Consult your doctor for guidance on gradually tapering the dosage to minimize potential withdrawal effects or rebound symptoms.
* **Q: How should I store cilostazol?** A: Store cilostazol at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Follow the specific storage instructions on the product label.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q:  Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking cilostazol?** A: Avoid excessive grapefruit juice consumption, as it can increase cilostazol levels.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking cilostazol?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol use may increase the risk of certain side effects.  Discuss this with your doctor.
