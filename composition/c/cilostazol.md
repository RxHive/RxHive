# Cilostazol

**Generic Name:** Cilostazol

**Usage:**

Cilostazol is primarily used to improve symptoms of intermittent claudication (pain in the legs and buttocks during exercise due to peripheral artery disease, or PAD).  It may also be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with PAD.  **Important Note:** Cilostazol is not a cure for PAD, but rather helps manage its symptoms.  It should be used under the guidance of a physician.  Off-label uses may exist, but should only be considered under strict medical supervision.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Heartburn
* Abdominal pain
* Flushing
* Shortness of breath
* Palpitations

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Bleeding (especially in patients already at risk)
* Worsening of heart failure
* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)


**How it Works:**

Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and a platelet aggregation inhibitor.  This means it works in two ways to improve blood flow and reduce symptoms:

1. **Vasodilation:** It relaxes blood vessels, particularly in the legs, making it easier for blood to flow through them. This reduces pain during exercise.
2. **Platelet Inhibition:** It prevents platelets from clumping together, which reduces blood clotting and improves blood flow. This helps maintain better circulation in the affected arteries.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take Cilostazol if I have heart problems?**  A:  Cilostazol should be used cautiously in patients with heart problems, especially those with a history of heart failure or unstable angina.  Your doctor needs to assess your risk before prescribing it.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Cilostazol?** A: While there's no absolute prohibition, alcohol can potentially increase the risk of dizziness and other side effects.  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: If you experience any significant or concerning side effects, stop taking Cilostazol and contact your doctor immediately.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  It may take several weeks to notice a significant improvement in symptoms.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Cilostazol suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop taking Cilostazol suddenly.  Your doctor should gradually reduce your dosage to minimize potential withdrawal effects.

* **Q: Is Cilostazol suitable for everyone with PAD?** A: No, Cilostazol is not suitable for everyone with PAD.  People with certain heart conditions, liver problems, or who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take it.  Your doctor will assess your suitability for this medication.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, Cilostazol can interact with other medications.  It is crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
