# Cetirizine (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Cetirizine (Systemic)

### Usage

Cetirizine is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and urticaria (hives).  Allergic rhinitis symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion. Urticaria manifests as itchy, raised welts on the skin.  Cetirizine effectively reduces these symptoms by blocking histamine, a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions.

Beyond its primary uses, cetirizine has several off-label applications.  These include:

* **Adjunctive treatment of anaphylaxis:** While not a first-line treatment, it can help manage skin symptoms of anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction) *in conjunction with epinephrine*.  It's crucial to understand that cetirizine does *not* address airway obstruction or shock, the most dangerous aspects of anaphylaxis.
* **Angioedema:**  Cetirizine may be used to treat angioedema, a swelling of the skin, often in the face, lips, or throat, which can be caused by allergic reactions. However, epinephrine is the primary treatment if there's any risk of airway or cardiovascular compromise.
* **Premedication for infusion reactions:**  Cetirizine, often combined with other medications, may be used before infusions of certain chemotherapy agents or biologics to lessen the chance of infusion-related allergic reactions.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on age, weight, condition, and the formulation (oral or intravenous).  Always follow your doctor's prescription and the medication's instructions.  The information below is for general knowledge only and should not replace professional medical advice.

**Adults (Oral):**

* Allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis: 10 mg once daily.  For seasonal allergies, it might be taken 2-5 hours before anticipated exposure, but daily use is generally more effective.
* Urticaria (acute or chronic spontaneous):  10 mg once daily; may be increased up to 20 mg twice daily if needed, under medical supervision.


**Children (Oral):** Dosage depends heavily on age and weight and should always be determined by a healthcare provider. General guidelines are provided below but should not be considered a replacement for direct medical guidance.


* **Infants (6-11 months):** 2.5 mg once daily.
* **Children (1-5 years):** 2.5-5 mg once or twice daily (maximum 5 mg/day).
* **Children (6-11 years):** 5-10 mg once daily.

**Adults and Children (Intravenous):**  Intravenous administration is usually only done in specific circumstances and under the supervision of a healthcare professional.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal and hepatic impairment require dosage adjustments.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist for personalized guidance.  Intravenous cetirizine should be avoided in children under six with renal impairment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of users):

* Drowsiness
* Headache

Less common, but potentially serious side effects:

* Dizziness
* Fatigue

### How it Works

Cetirizine is a second-generation histamine H1-receptor antagonist.  Histamine is a substance that the body releases during an allergic reaction, triggering symptoms like itching, sneezing, and swelling. Cetirizine works by blocking histamine from binding to its receptors, thus preventing these allergic responses.  It’s generally considered less sedating than older, first-generation antihistamines.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cetirizine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to cetirizine, hydroxyzine, levocetirizine, piperazine derivatives, or any formulation component. Individuals with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <10 mL/minute) should also avoid its use.
* **Interactions:** Cetirizine can interact with several other medications, including alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Cetirizine is a Category B drug during pregnancy, meaning it poses no risk to the fetus in animal studies, however, human studies are not conclusive.  It's excreted in breast milk, and infants may experience drowsiness or irritability. Consult your healthcare provider about the risks and benefits of using cetirizine during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Elderly and Pediatric Patients:** Older adults and children might be more susceptible to side effects, including drowsiness. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Due to the potential for drowsiness, avoid activities requiring alertness until you know how cetirizine affects you.


### FAQs

* **Can I take cetirizine with alcohol?**  No, avoid combining cetirizine with alcohol or other CNS depressants as this can increase drowsiness and other side effects.
* **How should I store cetirizine?** Store according to the instructions on the medication label; usually at room temperature.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don’t double the dose.
* **Is cetirizine habit-forming?** No, cetirizine is not considered habit-forming.
* **Can I stop taking cetirizine suddenly?**  Unless advised by your doctor, it is best to follow the prescribed course of treatment. Sudden discontinuation may not be advisable.  Consult your doctor if you wish to stop treatment.
