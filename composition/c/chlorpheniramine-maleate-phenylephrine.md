# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to temporarily relieve symptoms of the common cold, hay fever, or other upper respiratory allergies.  Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that reduces sneezing, runny nose, and itchy, watery eyes. Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving nasal congestion.  It's typically used for short-term relief of symptoms, not for long-term management of allergies or colds.  Always follow the dosage instructions on the label or as directed by a doctor.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect of chlorpheniramine.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth, nose, and throat:**  Drink plenty of fluids to help alleviate this.
* **Headache:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Insomnia (trouble sleeping):**  Avoid taking this medication late in the day.
* **Increased heart rate:**  More likely with higher doses or pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Increased blood pressure:**  This is more of a concern for individuals with hypertension.
* **Constipation:**

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Fast or irregular heartbeat
* Difficulty urinating
* Seizures


**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate (Antihistamine):**  Works by blocking the effects of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. Histamine causes many of the symptoms of allergies, such as runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes. By blocking histamine, chlorpheniramine relieves these symptoms.

* **Phenylephrine (Decongestant):**  Narrows blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.  This allows for easier breathing.


**FAQs:**
