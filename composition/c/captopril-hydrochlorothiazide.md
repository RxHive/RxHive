# Captopril + Hydrochlorothiazide

**Generic Name:** Captopril and Hydrochlorothiazide

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  Captopril is an ACE inhibitor, and hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic.  By working together, they lower blood pressure more effectively than either drug alone.  It may be prescribed alone or in combination with other medications to control blood pressure.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **From Captopril:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, headache, dry cough (a persistent, bothersome side effect that can signal discontinuation), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, changes in taste (metallic taste), rash, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), angioedema (a serious allergic reaction causing swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat - seek immediate medical attention if this occurs).
* **From Hydrochlorothiazide:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, dehydration, frequent urination, increased thirst, low blood pressure (hypotension), muscle cramps, weakness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight), electrolyte imbalances (low potassium, sodium, or magnesium).
* **Combined Effects:** The combination can increase the risk of some side effects listed above, especially hypotension and electrolyte imbalances.


**How it Works:**

* **Captopril (ACE inhibitor):** Works by blocking the action of an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).  ACE is involved in the production of a hormone called angiotensin II, which narrows blood vessels. By blocking ACE, captopril reduces the production of angiotensin II, causing blood vessels to relax and widen, thus lowering blood pressure.
* **Hydrochlorothiazide (thiazide diuretic):** Works by increasing the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the urine. This reduces the volume of blood circulating in the body, leading to lower blood pressure.  The diuretic effect also helps to counter the potassium-sparing effect of captopril, mitigating the risk of hyperkalemia.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Alcohol can lower blood pressure, so combining it with this medication can increase the risk of dangerously low blood pressure.  Limit or avoid alcohol consumption while on this medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as some may interact with captopril and hydrochlorothiazide.  Certain medications (e.g., potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs) can increase the risk of side effects.
* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, persistent dizziness or lightheadedness, or significant changes in your urine output.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: It may take several weeks to see the full effects of this medication.  Regular blood pressure monitoring is essential.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A:  No, abruptly stopping this medication can lead to a sudden increase in blood pressure, potentially causing serious health problems.  Always consult your doctor before stopping or changing your dosage.
