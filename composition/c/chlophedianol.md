# Chlophedianol
### Generic Name
Chlophedianol

### Usage
Chlophedianol is primarily used as a cough suppressant, also known as an antitussive.  It's effective in relieving coughs caused by various upper respiratory tract infections and other conditions where a persistent, non-productive cough is a significant symptom.  While primarily used for suppressing coughs, it's important to note that it doesn't treat the underlying cause of the cough.  Using Chlophedianol alongside other treatments for the underlying condition is often necessary.

### How it Works

Chlophedianol is a centrally acting cough suppressant. This means it works by affecting the central nervous system, specifically the cough center in the medulla of the brain. By acting on this area, Chlophedianol reduces the signals that trigger the cough reflex, thus suppressing the cough.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Chlophedianol is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to the medication, acute asthma, hypertension (high blood pressure), or those concurrently using droxidopa, furazolidone, or MAO inhibitors.
* **Warnings/Use with caution:** Exercise caution when using Chlophedianol in elderly individuals, young children, those with Addison's disease, cardiovascular problems, glaucoma, seizures, hyperthyroidism, a history of asthma or COPD, peptic ulcers, or urinary disturbances.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Chlophedianol is categorized as pregnancy category C.  This means that the potential benefits may outweigh the risks in some cases, but it's crucial to discuss its use with a healthcare provider during pregnancy.  It's not recommended for use during breastfeeding due to its excretion in breast milk.
* **Drug Interactions:** Chlophedianol may interact with other medications.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking.
* **Alcohol and Caffeine:** Avoid consuming alcohol and caffeine while taking Chlophedianol, as they can exacerbate drowsiness and other side effects.
