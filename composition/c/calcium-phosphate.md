# Calcium Phosphate
### Generic Name
Calcium Phosphate

### Usage
Calcium phosphate is primarily used as a dietary supplement to prevent or treat hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) in individuals who don't obtain enough calcium from their diet.  It plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy bones and teeth.  Beyond dietary supplementation, calcium phosphate is also employed in the treatment of several conditions stemming from calcium deficiency, including:

* **Osteoporosis:** A disease characterized by weakened and brittle bones, increasing the risk of fractures. Calcium phosphate helps to improve bone mineral density.
* **Osteomalacia:**  A softening of the bones due to inadequate mineralization, often caused by vitamin D deficiency. Calcium phosphate contributes to the process of bone hardening.
* **Pseudohypoparathyroidism:** A rare genetic disorder affecting the body's response to parathyroid hormone, leading to hypocalcemia.
* **Hypoparathyroidism:** A condition where the parathyroid glands don't produce enough parathyroid hormone, resulting in low blood calcium levels.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on age, the underlying condition being treated, and the specific formulation of calcium phosphate.  Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider or the medication label.

**Adults:**

* **For Hypocalcemia, Osteoporosis, Osteomalacia, Pseudohypoparathyroidism, and Hypoparathyroidism:** The typical oral dose is 1-2 tablets daily (containing 600-1200 mg of calcium phosphate).  The exact dosage needs to be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and blood calcium levels.
* **Dietary Supplementation:**  The recommended daily allowance varies with age. Adults aged 19-50 generally need 1000 mg of elemental calcium per day, while those over 50 require 1200 mg.  Elemental calcium is the amount of calcium available for absorption, and the actual amount of calcium phosphate needed will depend on its concentration.

**Children:** Dosage for children as dietary supplementation should be determined by a pediatrician and depends on age:

* Infants (0-6 months): 210 mg/day elemental calcium
* Infants (7-12 months): 270 mg/day elemental calcium
* Children (1-3 years): 500 mg/day elemental calcium
* Children (4-8 years): 800 mg/day elemental calcium
* Children (9-18 years): 1300 mg/day elemental calcium

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specifically provided in standard manufacturer's labeling. However, caution is advised, especially in renal impairment, and frequent monitoring of serum calcium and phosphorus levels is recommended.

### Side Effects

While generally well-tolerated, calcium phosphate can cause some side effects, ranging from mild to severe.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Decreased appetite
* Constipation
* Polydipsia (excessive thirst)
* Dry mouth
* Polyuria (excessive urination)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hyperphosphatemia (high blood phosphorus levels)
* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels)
* Milk-alkali syndrome (a rare but serious condition)
* Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle)
* Pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe ones, consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Calcium phosphate acts primarily as a calcium supplement. When blood calcium levels are low, calcium phosphate increases the available calcium for absorption in the intestines. Calcium plays a multitude of roles in the body, including:

* **Bone health:**  Calcium is a major structural component of bones and teeth, contributing to their strength and density.
* **Muscle function:**  Calcium is involved in muscle contraction and relaxation.
* **Nerve transmission:** Calcium is essential for proper nerve signaling.
* **Blood clotting:**  Calcium plays a role in the blood clotting process.
* **Heart function:**  Calcium is important for maintaining regular heart rhythms.

By replenishing calcium levels, calcium phosphate helps to alleviate symptoms of calcium deficiency and support various physiological processes.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Calcium phosphate is contraindicated in individuals with conditions associated with hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) and hypercalciuria (high calcium levels in urine).
* **Interactions:**  Calcium phosphate can interact with several medications, including calcium-channel blockers, cardiac glycosides, thiazide diuretics, tetracycline antibiotics, alendronate, atenolol, iron, quinolone antibiotics, sodium fluoride, and zinc.  The absorption of these medications can be affected, or the risk of hypercalcemia can be increased. Consult your doctor about potential drug interactions.  Alcohol intake may also increase the risk of osteoporosis.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with renal impairment, sarcoidosis (a chronic inflammatory disease), a history of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), and in pregnant women.  Careful monitoring of calcium and phosphorus levels is vital in these populations.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take calcium phosphate with other medications?** A: Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: How should I store calcium phosphate?** A: Store calcium phosphate as directed on the label, usually in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is calcium phosphate safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** A: While calcium is essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding, it's crucial to discuss the appropriate dosage with your doctor.
* **Q:  Can I take too much calcium phosphate?** A: Excessive intake of calcium can lead to hypercalcemia, a potentially dangerous condition. Always follow the recommended dosage.
