# Carboplatin
### Generic Name
Carboplatin

### Usage

Carboplatin is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer.  Its primary use is in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, often in combination with other chemotherapy agents. This combination approach is used for both initial treatment and palliative care for recurrent ovarian cancer, even after previous cisplatin-based treatments.

Beyond ovarian cancer, carboplatin is also used off-label (meaning it's not officially approved by regulatory bodies for these specific uses but is sometimes prescribed by doctors) in the treatment of a wide range of other cancers, including:  bladder, cervical, endometrial, esophageal, head and neck, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, metastatic breast cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, testicular cancer, thymoma/thymic malignancies, thyroid carcinoma, and cancers of unknown primary origin.  In these cases, it's frequently given in combination with other drugs and/or radiation therapy. The specific protocols and dosages vary significantly depending on the cancer type, stage, and the overall treatment plan determined by the oncologist.


### Dosage

Carboplatin dosage is complex and highly individualized, determined primarily by the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which measures kidney function.  The most common method for calculating the adult dose uses the Calvert formula:  Total dose (mg) = Target AUC x (GFR + 25).  The target AUC (area under the curve, a measure of drug exposure) is set by the oncologist based on the specific treatment protocol.  The FDA recommends capping estimated GFR at 125 mL/min to avoid toxicity.  The GFR is usually obtained through blood tests.

Dosage also varies based on the cancer being treated and whether carboplatin is used alone or in combination with other therapies.  The examples in the provided text illustrate the wide range of regimens and dosages used in different cancers.  **It's crucial to understand that this information is not a substitute for professional medical guidance; only a physician can determine the appropriate dose for a given patient.**

Pediatric dosing is even more nuanced and is not standardized across all conditions. It may be based on body surface area (mg/m²), weight (mg/kg), or a modified Calvert formula.  Again, only an oncologist specializing in pediatric oncology should calculate the appropriate dosage for a child.  Several modified Calvert formulas are mentioned (Newell, Mann/Pein, Marina/St. Jude) which further highlight the complexity of pediatric dosing.

The medication is usually administered intravenously (IV) over a period of 15-60 minutes, though in some cases, infusions might last up to 24 hours.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Pain
* Hyponatremia (low sodium), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), hypocalcemia (low calcium), hypokalemia (low potassium)
* Vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea
* Bone marrow suppression (leading to anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia – low counts of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets respectively)
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALP and AST)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Weakness
* Decreased creatinine clearance and increased BUN (blood urea nitrogen) levels


Less common but potentially serious side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients or less, some reported post-marketing) include:

* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage)
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Constipation, diarrhea, taste changes (dysgeusia), mouth sores (mucositis and stomatitis)
* Bleeding complications
* Increased bilirubin levels
* Infections
* Visual disturbances
* Ototoxicity (hearing damage)
* Increased serum creatinine levels
* Anaphylaxis, anorexia, bronchospasm, cardiac failure, stroke, dehydration, embolism, skin rash, tissue necrosis (from extravasation), urticaria, and vision loss

If you experience any adverse effects, it is vital to contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Carboplatin is an alkylating agent, a type of chemotherapy drug that works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells.  It does this by creating cross-links between strands of DNA, preventing the cells from replicating and ultimately leading to their death.  Carboplatin isn't specific to a particular phase of the cell cycle, meaning it can affect cancer cells at various stages of their growth and division.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Carboplatin should not be used in individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions to carboplatin, cisplatin, other platinum-based drugs, mannitol, or any formulation component; severe bone marrow suppression; or significant bleeding.  The Canadian labeling also includes pre-existing severe renal impairment as a contraindication.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Carboplatin can interact with many other drugs, particularly those affecting the kidneys, bone marrow, or nervous system. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.  Many interactions are listed in the provided text and should be discussed with a healthcare professional.
* **Special Populations:**  Extra caution should be exercised when administering carboplatin to pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, elderly patients, and those with existing liver, kidney, hearing, nerve, or neuromuscular diseases.  Dose adjustments are often necessary based on age, weight, and organ function.  The medication is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus.
* **Renal and Bone Marrow Toxicity:**  Both renal and bone marrow toxicity are significant risks associated with carboplatin. Regular monitoring of kidney function (GFR, creatinine, BUN) and blood counts is essential.
* **Hypersensitivity Reactions:**  Anaphylactic-like reactions can occur, demanding immediate medical attention.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is carboplatin stored?** A:  Specific storage instructions will be provided by your pharmacy. Generally, chemotherapy drugs require careful storage to maintain their potency and safety.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from carboplatin treatment?** A:  The response time varies greatly depending on the cancer type, stage, and the patient's individual response to treatment.  It's not a quick-acting drug; rather, it's part of a comprehensive cancer treatment strategy.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while on carboplatin?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while undergoing chemotherapy treatment as it can interact negatively with the drugs and potentially worsen side effects, especially nausea and vomiting. Discuss this with your healthcare provider for personalized advice.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of carboplatin?** A:  Chemotherapy administration is strictly scheduled.  Contact your oncologist or treatment center immediately if you miss a scheduled dose; do not attempt to adjust the dosing yourself.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of carboplatin?** A:  Some long-term side effects are possible, including peripheral neuropathy, hearing loss, kidney damage, and secondary cancers. Regular follow-up care is crucial to monitor for and manage these potential long-term consequences.
