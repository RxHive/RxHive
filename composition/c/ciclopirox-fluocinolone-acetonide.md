# Ciclopirox + Fluocinolone acetonide

**Generic Name:** Ciclopirox + Fluocinolone Acetonide

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical antifungal and corticosteroid used to treat skin infections characterized by both fungal growth and inflammation.  It's often prescribed for conditions like:

* **Tinea cruris (jock itch):** A fungal infection affecting the groin area.
* **Tinea corporis (ringworm):** A fungal infection affecting the body.
* **Tinea pedis (athlete's foot):** A fungal infection affecting the feet.
* **Seborrheic dermatitis with secondary fungal infection:**  A skin condition causing scaling and inflammation, often complicated by a fungal infection.
* **Eczema with secondary fungal infection:**  Inflamed skin (eczema) complicated by a fungal infection.

**Important Note:** This medication is for external use only and should not be ingested.  It is usually applied thinly to the affected area once or twice daily as directed by a physician.  The duration of treatment varies depending on the severity of the infection and individual response.


**Side Effects:**  While generally well-tolerated, side effects can occur, especially with prolonged use or application to large areas of skin.  These may include:

* **Burning, itching, or irritation at the application site:** This is relatively common and often mild.
* **Skin thinning (atrophy):**  Prolonged use of corticosteroids can thin the skin, making it more susceptible to damage.
* **Stretch marks (striae):**  Another potential consequence of long-term corticosteroid use.
* **Increased skin sensitivity:** The skin may become more sensitive to sunlight.
* **Acneiform eruptions:**  Breakouts resembling acne.
* **Secondary infection:**  Rarely, a secondary bacterial or fungal infection may develop.
* **Skin discoloration (hypopigmentation):** Loss of skin color.
* **Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles):**
* **Allergic contact dermatitis:**  An allergic reaction to the medication itself.


**How it Works:**

* **Ciclopirox:** This is the antifungal component. It works by inhibiting the growth of fungi, thereby treating the fungal infection.  Its mechanism of action involves interfering with fungal cell membrane function.

* **Fluocinolone acetonide:** This is a corticosteroid, which has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant properties. It reduces the inflammation and itching associated with the skin infection. It works by reducing the activity of immune cells in the skin.
