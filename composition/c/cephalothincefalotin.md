# Cephalothin/Cefalotin
### Generic Name
Cephalothin/Cefalotin

### Usage

Cephalothin, a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, is a broad-spectrum drug primarily used to prevent postoperative infections in various surgical procedures, including vaginal hysterectomies, head and neck surgeries, heart valve repairs/replacements, and arthroplasties.  Beyond surgical prophylaxis, it effectively treats a range of bacterial infections across different body systems.  These include respiratory tract infections (like pneumonia or bronchitis), skin and soft tissue infections (such as abscesses or cellulitis), urinary tract infections, bone and joint infections (osteomyelitis), gastrointestinal infections, genitourinary tract infections, meningitis, and septicemia (blood poisoning).  The effectiveness depends on the specific bacteria causing the infection and their susceptibility to cephalothin.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies depending on the severity and type of infection.  

* **Susceptible Infections (e.g., bone, joint, GI, genitourinary infections, meningitis, septicemia):**  The usual intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) dose ranges from 500 mg to 2 g every 4-6 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 12 g.

* **Surgical Prophylaxis:**  Typically, 2 g IV is administered 30 minutes to 1 hour before surgery.  Depending on the surgical procedure's length, a repeat dose of 2 g intraoperatively might be given, followed by additional doses every 6 hours for 24-72 hours post-surgery (dosage and duration depend on the surgery type; postoperative prophylaxis is not recommended for clean or clean-contaminated surgeries).

* **Respiratory Tract, Skin & Soft Tissue, and Urinary Tract Infections:**  The usual IM or IV dose is 500 mg every 6 hours.


**Pediatric Dosage:** Dosage is determined by weight.

* **Susceptible Infections (infants, children, adolescents):** Infants weighing less than 2 kg typically receive 20 mg/kg every 12 hours (IM or IV). Infants over 2 kg, children, and adolescents usually receive 100 mg/kg (range: 80-160 mg/kg) in divided doses every 4-6 hours (IM or IV).

* **Surgical Prophylaxis (children and adolescents):**  The IV dose is 20-30 mg/kg, administered 30 minutes to 1 hour before surgery.  Repeat doses may be necessary intraoperatively and postoperatively (20-30 mg/kg every 6 hours for 24-72 hours, depending on the surgery).  Adolescents typically receive the adult dose.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with liver problems.

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary.  An initial loading dose of 1-2g is given, followed by reduced maintenance doses based on creatinine clearance (CrCl):  CrCl 50-80 mL/min: 2 g every 6 hours; CrCl 25-50 mL/min: 1.5 g every 6 hours; CrCl 10-25 mL/min: 1 g every 6 hours; CrCl 2-10 mL/min: 500 mg every 6 hours; CrCl <2 mL/min: 500 mg every 8 hours.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Pain at the injection site (IM administration)
* Drug fever
* Allergic skin reactions (rash, itching)
* Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein, usually with high doses or prolonged IV infusions)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

*  Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis)
*  <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> colitis (severe intestinal inflammation)
*  Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells)
*  Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage)
*  Increased liver enzyme levels


If you experience any side effects, particularly serious ones, consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Cephalothin is a bactericidal antibiotic. It works by inhibiting the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  By binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) on bacterial cells, it disrupts the construction and integrity of the cell wall, ultimately leading to cell lysis (breakdown) and bacterial death.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cephalothin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to cephalothin, other cephalosporins, penicillins, or any component of the formulation.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Cephalothin may interact with several medications, including aminoglycosides (increased risk of nephrotoxicity), loop diuretics (increased risk of nephrotoxicity), probenecid (increased cephalothin levels), and anticoagulants (increased bleeding risk).  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Cephalothin use carries a risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis), hypersensitivity reactions, nephrotoxicity, and superinfections (e.g., <i>C. difficile</i> infection).  Use with caution in patients with pre-existing kidney or liver problems, GI disease, or a history of seizures.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Cephalothin is a Category B drug in pregnancy (animal studies show no risk, but human studies are lacking).  It's excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is generally not recommended while using cephalothin.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take cephalothin with other medications?** A:  It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements) you are taking to avoid potential interactions.


* **Q: How should I store cephalothin?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label.  Generally, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.


* **Q: Is cephalothin safe for everyone?** A:  While generally safe when used as directed, cephalothin has potential side effects and contraindications.  Your doctor will assess your medical history to determine its suitability for you.


* **Q: How long will it take to feel better after starting cephalothin?** A: The response time varies depending on the infection's severity and the individual's response. Consult your doctor if you don't see improvement within a reasonable timeframe.


* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any significant side effects or allergic reactions.
