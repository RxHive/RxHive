# Calcium Citrate Malate

**Generic Name:** Calcium Citrate Malate

**Usage:**

Calcium Citrate Malate is a dietary supplement used to increase calcium intake.  It's often recommended for individuals who need to supplement their calcium levels for various reasons, including:

* **Preventing and treating osteoporosis:**  Calcium is crucial for maintaining bone health and density.
* **Supporting muscle function:** Calcium plays a vital role in muscle contractions.
* **Maintaining nerve function:**  Calcium is involved in nerve impulse transmission.
* **Supporting blood clotting:** Calcium is a necessary factor in the blood clotting process.
* **Treating calcium deficiencies:**  This can be caused by various factors like inadequate dietary intake, certain medical conditions, or medications.


**Note:** The specific dosage and usage instructions will vary depending on individual needs and should always be determined by a healthcare professional.


**Side Effects:**

Generally, Calcium Citrate Malate is well-tolerated. However, some individuals may experience side effects, such as:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Constipation, gas, bloating, and nausea are the most common side effects.  These are often dose-related and can be mitigated by taking the supplement with food and increasing water intake.
* **Kidney stones:** In individuals predisposed to kidney stones, high doses of calcium can increase the risk of stone formation.  This is more of a concern with calcium supplements taken in isolation without appropriate dietary considerations.
* **Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels):** This is rare but can occur with excessive calcium intake and can lead to serious health problems.  It's crucial to follow recommended dosages.


**How it Works:**

Calcium Citrate Malate provides calcium in a form that is readily absorbed by the body. Citrate and malate are organic acids that enhance calcium absorption compared to other forms of calcium supplements, such as calcium carbonate.  Once absorbed, the calcium is used by the body for its various functions, including building and maintaining strong bones and teeth, facilitating muscle contractions, and regulating nerve and blood functions.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Calcium Citrate Malate better than other calcium supplements?**  Calcium Citrate Malate generally has better absorption than calcium carbonate, especially for individuals with low stomach acid. However, the best type of calcium supplement depends on individual needs and preferences.  A doctor or registered dietitian can help determine the most suitable option.
* **Can I take Calcium Citrate Malate with other medications?** Some medications can interact with calcium supplements.  It is important to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **What is the recommended dosage?** The recommended dosage varies depending on age, health status, and individual needs.  Always follow the directions on the product label or consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
* **Can I get enough calcium from diet alone?**  For some individuals, it is possible to meet their calcium needs through diet alone.  However, many people may benefit from supplementation to ensure adequate intake. A balanced diet rich in calcium-rich foods like dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified foods is always recommended.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and consult your doctor or pharmacist.
