# Calcium Citrate Malate
### Generic Name
Calcium Citrate Malate

### Usage
Calcium citrate malate is a supplement used primarily to increase calcium levels in the body.  This is important for several reasons:

* **Bone health:** Calcium is the primary building block of bones and teeth.  Calcium citrate malate helps maintain bone density and strength, reducing the risk of osteoporosis (weakening of the bones) and fractures, particularly beneficial for children, adolescents, adults, and postmenopausal women.  It aids in bone accrual in growing children and adolescents and helps slow bone loss in older adults.

* **Other bodily functions:** Calcium plays a crucial role in various other bodily functions, including muscle contractions, nerve impulses, and blood clotting. While not its primary use, adequate calcium intake supports these processes.


### Dosage

Dosage of calcium citrate malate varies depending on individual needs and age.  It's crucial to follow the instructions on the product label or your doctor's recommendations.  Generally:

* **Adults:** The typical adult dose ranges from 500mg to 2000mg of elemental calcium per day, often divided into multiple doses.  The amount of elemental calcium will vary depending on the product formulation.  Always check the label for elemental calcium content.

* **Children and Adolescents:**  Dosage for children and adolescents depends on age, weight, and overall health.  A healthcare professional should determine the appropriate dosage.

* **Forms:** Calcium citrate malate is usually available as tablets or capsules.  Always follow the instructions provided with the specific product you are using regarding administration.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Constipation
* Gas
* Bloating
* Nausea
* Stomach upset

Less common, but more serious side effects might include:

* Kidney stones (especially in individuals predisposed to kidney stones)
* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels â€“ symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and constipation)

**If you experience any adverse effects, particularly severe ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Calcium citrate malate works by providing your body with readily absorbable calcium.  Unlike some other calcium salts, citrate malate is water-soluble, improving its absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.  Once absorbed, the calcium is used by the body for various functions, primarily bone health.  It helps to maintain the balance of calcium in the bloodstream and prevents excessive calcium loss from bones.


### Precautions

* **Kidney stones:** Individuals with a history of kidney stones should use caution and consult their doctor before taking calcium citrate malate supplements.

* **Hypercalcemia:**  People with conditions that can cause high blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia) should avoid calcium supplements.

* **Medication interactions:**  Calcium citrate malate can interact with certain medications, such as tetracyclines (antibiotics) and thyroid medications. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before taking calcium supplements to ensure the dosage is safe and appropriate.

* **Other medical conditions:** People with certain medical conditions should consult their physician before using calcium citrate malate.
