# Cefuroxime

**Generic Name:** Cefuroxime

**Usage:** Cefuroxime is a cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Respiratory tract infections:** Bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, tonsillitis
* **Ear infections (otitis media):**  Especially in children.
* **Skin and skin structure infections:** Cellulitis, abscesses, wound infections
* **Genitourinary tract infections:** Urinary tract infections (UTIs), gonorrhea (in some cases)
* **Bone and joint infections:** Osteomyelitis (infection of the bone)


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, cefuroxime can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  These can range from mild to severe. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives (more serious reactions are possible, including angioedema and anaphylaxis â€“ seek immediate medical attention if these occur)
* **Headache**
* **Vaginal yeast infection** (due to disruption of normal gut flora)
* **Elevated liver enzymes** (seen in blood tests)


**Less common but more serious side effects include:**

* **Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD):**  A potentially serious complication that can occur after antibiotic use.
* **Seizures:** Especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney problems or those on high doses.
* **Blood disorders:** Anemia, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* **Pseudomembranous colitis:** A serious inflammation of the colon.


**How it Works:** Cefuroxime is a beta-lactam antibiotic.  It works by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  This disruption weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to cell lysis (breakdown) and ultimately bacterial death.  It's important to note that cefuroxime is effective against certain bacteria but not others;  the specific bacteria it targets depends on the type of infection and the susceptibility of the bacteria.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking cefuroxime?** A:  It's generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking cefuroxime, as alcohol can exacerbate side effects, particularly gastrointestinal upset.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How long should I take cefuroxime?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the type and severity of the infection and your response to the medication. Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment length.  Do not stop taking the medication prematurely, even if you feel better.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a serious side effect?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe allergic reactions (such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue), severe diarrhea, or seizures.

* **Q: Can I take cefuroxime if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: Discuss your pregnancy or breastfeeding status with your doctor before taking cefuroxime.  The risks and benefits should be carefully weighed.

* **Q: Can I take cefuroxime with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking to avoid potential drug interactions.
