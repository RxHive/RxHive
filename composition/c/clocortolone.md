# Clocortolone
### Generic Name
Clocortolone

### Usage

Clocortolone is a topical corticosteroid medication primarily used to relieve the inflammation and itching (pruritus) associated with various skin conditions that respond to corticosteroids.  These conditions, often referred to as corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, include a wide range of inflammatory skin problems.  While its primary use is for inflammatory skin conditions, it can also be effective in treating inflammatory hyperkeratotic dermatoses – skin conditions characterized by inflammation and thickened skin.  The specific skin conditions treated will be determined by a healthcare professional based on a patient’s individual needs.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** For corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, the 0.1% cream is typically applied sparingly to the affected area three times daily (TID) and gently rubbed in. For inflammatory hyperkeratotic dermatoses, the same 0.1% cream is applied TID to the affected area. Treatment should be stopped once the condition is under control.  If no improvement is seen, a review of the diagnosis may be necessary.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  For corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in children, the 0.1% cream should be applied using the smallest amount needed for effectiveness.  Children are more susceptible to systemic side effects from topical corticosteroids, emphasizing the importance of using only the minimal effective dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.


### Side Effects

Common side effects, though not consistently defined in terms of frequency, can include localized burning, redness (erythema), dryness, a small bumpy rash (papular rash), itching (pruritus), and local irritation.

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports include acne-like breakouts (acneiform eruption), stretch marks (atrophic striae), excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis), loss of skin color (hypopigmentation), skin softening (maceration), prickly heat (miliaria), a rash around the mouth (perioral dermatitis), and skin thinning (skin atrophy).  These are generally less frequent but can be more significant.

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Clocortolone is a medium-potency topical corticosteroid.  It works by reducing inflammation through several mechanisms. These include stabilizing the membranes of white blood cells (leukocytes), preventing the release of damaging substances; hindering the accumulation of macrophages (a type of immune cell) in inflamed areas; decreasing the permeability of blood vessel walls, reducing swelling; lowering the activity of the complement system (part of the immune response); counteracting the effects of histamine; and reducing the formation of scar tissue.  Essentially, it dampens the body's inflammatory response in the affected skin.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Clocortolone is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to clocortolone, other corticosteroids, or any ingredients in the formulation. It should also not be used on viral, fungal, or tubercular skin infections.

**Warnings:** Prolonged or extensive use can lead to adrenal suppression (reducing the body's natural cortisol production), which can manifest as hypercorticism (excess cortisol).  Other risks include contact dermatitis, Kaposi sarcoma (a type of cancer), and immunosuppression (increasing susceptibility to infections).  There's also a risk of local sensitization (allergic reaction) and systemic absorption (the drug being absorbed into the bloodstream).  In children, prolonged use may affect growth velocity.

**Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using clocortolone in elderly patients, children, and individuals with active tuberculosis in the respiratory tract or untreated fungal, bacterial, or systemic viral infections.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use Clocortolone on my face?** A:  Generally, it's not recommended for facial use unless specifically prescribed by a doctor due to increased risk of absorption and potential side effects.

* **Q: How should I store Clocortolone?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I use other skincare products with Clocortolone?** A:  It’s best to avoid using other skincare products on the treated area to prevent potential interactions and irritation.

* **Q: How long can I use Clocortolone?** A:  The duration of use depends on the condition and should be determined by your doctor.  Do not use it longer than directed.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the medication as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose.

* **Q: Is Clocortolone safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: Clocortolone is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. This means that studies in animals have shown adverse effects, and the potential benefits may outweigh the risks in some cases.  Extensive use, large quantities, or long-term use should be avoided during pregnancy.  It is unknown whether it's excreted in breast milk; use with caution during breastfeeding and consult with a healthcare professional.
