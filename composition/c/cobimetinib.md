# Cobimetinib
### Generic Name
Cobimetinib

### Usage
Cobimetinib is a targeted therapy primarily used in the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  It's crucial to note that it's only effective against melanomas with a specific genetic mutation: BRAF V600E or V600K.  Cobimetinib is *not* used alone; it's always administered in combination with another drug, typically vemurafenib. This combination therapy targets the BRAF and MEK proteins, which are key players in the signaling pathways that drive melanoma cell growth.  While its primary use is in melanoma treatment, off-label use in combination with other medications like atezolizumab and vemurafenib has been explored, although this is not officially supported by labeling.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Before starting treatment, a test must confirm the presence of the BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. Cobimetinib is not suitable for melanomas without these mutations. The standard dose is 60 mg orally once daily (OD) for 21 days of a 28-day treatment cycle. This is always given in combination with vemurafenib. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur. Off-label use involves a similar dose and schedule but in combination with atezolizumab and vemurafenib; this off-label combination begins after a 28-day course of Cobimetinib and vemurafenib alone.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Cobimetinib have not been established in children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary based on several factors, including liver and kidney function, and the occurrence of side effects.  Significant hepatic impairment does not require an initial dose adjustment but dose reduction may be necessary if hepatotoxicity develops.  Renal impairment (CrCl â‰¥30 mL/min) does not require adjustment.  There is no specific manufacturer's guidance for CrCl <30 mL/min.  Dose reductions are recommended for various toxicities, like cardiovascular issues (decreased LVEF), increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK), dermatological problems, hemorrhage, and ocular side effects.  The specific adjustments depend on the severity and type of toxicity and often involve withholding medication or reducing the daily dose to 40mg or 20mg.  Treatment might need to be permanently discontinued if tolerability issues persist.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (>10% of patients) include:

* Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (heart function)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Photosensitivity (increased sun sensitivity)
* Acneiform eruption (acne-like rash)
* Various electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypophosphatemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia)
* Lymphocytopenia (low lymphocyte count)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Increased liver enzyme levels (AST, ALT, ALP)
* Increased creatine phosphokinase level (muscle damage)
* Visual impairment (blurred vision, decreased visual acuity)
* Chorioretinopathy (eye disease)
* Retinal detachment
* Increased serum creatinine level (kidney function)
* Fever

Less common side effects (1-10% of patients) include chills, gastrointestinal bleeding, skin rash, genitourinary bleeding, and various skin cancers.  Rare but serious side effects include cerebral hemorrhage, and other secondary malignancies.

**It's vital to report any side effects to your doctor immediately.**

### How it Works

Cobimetinib is a MEK inhibitor.  MEK (mitogen-activated extracellular kinase) is a crucial enzyme in the signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and division.  In BRAF-mutated melanomas, this pathway is abnormally activated, promoting uncontrolled cell growth.  Cobimetinib selectively inhibits MEK1 and MEK2, thus blocking the signal that tells the cancer cells to proliferate, thereby slowing or stopping tumor growth.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cobimetinib is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Cobimetinib is metabolized by the liver's CYP3A4 enzymes. Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers can reduce Cobimetinib levels, while inhibitors can increase them. Grapefruit juice should be avoided as it inhibits CYP3A4.  Consult your doctor about potential interactions with other medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Cobimetinib can harm a developing fetus. Effective contraception is necessary during treatment and for two weeks afterward.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for two weeks after the final dose.
* **Other Precautions:** Cobimetinib can cause photosensitivity; patients should avoid excessive sun exposure and use sunscreen with a high SPF. Regular monitoring of liver and kidney function, blood counts, and heart function (LVEF) is essential.  Patients should be closely monitored for various side effects, including dermatological reactions, hemorrhage, new malignancies, and other toxicities.


### FAQs
