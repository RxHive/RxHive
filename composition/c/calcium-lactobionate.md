# Calcium Lactobionate
### Generic Name
Calcium Lactobionate

### Usage
Calcium lactobionate is primarily used to treat hypocalcemia, a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of calcium in the blood. This low calcium can stem from various causes, including dietary deficiencies (inadequate calcium intake), certain medical conditions affecting calcium absorption or metabolism, or as a consequence of aging.  While it's less common now, it has historically been used to address calcium deficiencies in general.  It's important to note that single-ingredient calcium lactobionate supplements are largely discontinued in many markets, and it may be found as a component within multi-ingredient formulations.


### Dosage
Dosage recommendations for calcium lactobionate vary significantly depending on the individual's specific needs and the underlying cause of hypocalcemia.  There isn't a standard, universally applicable dosage because it's crucial to tailor the amount to the patient's calcium levels and overall health status.  A physician will determine the appropriate dose based on blood tests and other assessments.  The medication might be administered in different forms (oral or intravenous, depending on the severity and the patient's condition), and the physician provides specific instructions on how often to take the medication and what form to use.  It's crucial to **never** attempt to self-prescribe or adjust the dosage without direct guidance from a healthcare professional.  Dosage information specific to children also requires expert medical oversight and varies greatly according to age and medical needs.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of calcium lactobionate, though generally mild, can include:

* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain or discomfort
* Headache
* Fatigue

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects require immediate medical attention. These can include:

*  Kidney stones (especially in individuals with a history of kidney stones)
*  Elevated calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia) – characterized by symptoms like excessive thirst, frequent urination, nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, and confusion.
*  Abnormal heart rhythms

If you experience any adverse effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Calcium lactobionate works by supplying the body with readily available calcium. Calcium plays a vital role in numerous bodily functions, including muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, blood clotting, and maintaining healthy bones and teeth.  When calcium levels are low, the body can't perform these essential functions optimally. Calcium lactobionate helps to restore these levels and alleviate the symptoms associated with hypocalcemia. The lactobionate component assists in the absorption and utilization of calcium within the body.

### Precautions
Several precautions should be observed when using calcium lactobionate:

* **Kidney disease:**  Individuals with kidney disease or impaired kidney function should use calcium lactobionate with extreme caution, as it can exacerbate existing kidney issues and increase the risk of kidney stones.  
* **Hypercalcemia:**  People with high blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia) should not take calcium lactobionate.
* **Heart conditions:**  Certain heart conditions can be affected by calcium levels; consult a physician before using calcium lactobionate if you have a history of heart problems.
* **Medication interactions:**  Calcium lactobionate can interact with several medications, including some antibiotics, diuretics (water pills), and heart medications. Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  While calcium is essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding, the appropriate dosage of calcium lactobionate requires medical supervision.  Self-medicating should be avoided.
* **Elderly:** The elderly might be more susceptible to some side effects; careful monitoring and potentially adjusted dosing are often necessary.
