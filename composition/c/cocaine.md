# Cocaine
### Generic Name
Cocaine Hydrochloride

### Usage
Cocaine hydrochloride is primarily used as a topical local anesthetic, specifically for the mucous membranes of the nasal cavities in adults.  Its use is limited to diagnostic procedures and surgeries within the nose.  While it can also be used topically on the oral and laryngeal mucous membranes, such applications are less common and should be considered only in specific situations under the close supervision of a medical professional.  It is crucial to understand that this information pertains to the *medicinal* use of cocaine hydrochloride under strict medical supervision. The recreational use of cocaine is extremely dangerous and illegal.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly based on the procedure and the area to be anesthetized.  The information below is for medical professionals only and should not be interpreted as self-treatment guidance.  Always follow a healthcare provider's instructions.

**Adult Dosage (Medical Use Only):**

* **Intranasal (4% solution):** 40-160 mg applied to the nasal mucous membranes.  Each pledget typically absorbs 40 mg (1 mL) of solution. Pledgets can remain in place for up to 20 minutes before removal and procedure continuation. The maximum dose is generally 160 mg (4 pledgets) or 3 mg/kg of Cocaine hydrochloride per procedure.

* **Topical (4% solution, 40 mg/mL):**  40 mg/mL applied topically to oral, laryngeal, or nasal mucous membranes. Dosage depends on the area, tissue vascularity, individual tolerance, and type of anesthesia needed.  The lowest effective dose should always be used.

* **Topical (10% solution, 100 mg/mL):** 100 mg/mL applied topically to oral, laryngeal, or nasal mucous membranes. Dosage is determined by the factors mentioned above; the lowest effective dose should be used.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of cocaine hydrochloride in children have not been established.  Use in pediatric patients is generally contraindicated.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments might be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Consult a healthcare professional for specific guidance in such cases.

### Side Effects
Cocaine hydrochloride, even in medically supervised applications, carries potential side effects. These can range from mild to severe, and prompt medical attention is necessary if any serious side effects develop.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Hypertension (increased blood pressure)
* Headache
* Tachycardia (increased heart rate)
* Epistaxis (nosebleed)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* QT prolongation on ECG (potentially fatal heart rhythm disturbance)
* Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Seizures
* Drug abuse/dependence
* Tremors
* Corneal changes (sloughing, ulceration)
* Anxiety
* Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)
* Ischemic heart disease


### How it Works
Cocaine hydrochloride is an ester-type local anesthetic that works by blocking nerve signals. It achieves this by decreasing the permeability of nerve cell membranes to sodium ions. This inhibits depolarization, preventing the transmission of pain signals.  Additionally, cocaine interferes with the reuptake of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter, leading to vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels). This vasoconstriction helps to prolong the anesthetic effect and reduce bleeding at the application site.


### Precautions
Several precautions must be observed when using cocaine hydrochloride.  This medication has a high potential for abuse and dependence, making careful monitoring and controlled use essential.

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to cocaine, other ester-based anesthetics, or any formulation component.

**Warnings:**

* Increased risk of seizures.
* Increased blood pressure and heart rate.
* High potential for abuse and dependence.

**Use with Caution:**

* Patients with a history of cocaine abuse.
* Acutely ill, debilitated, or elderly patients.
* Pediatric patients.
* Patients with severely traumatized mucosa or sepsis in the application area.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I use cocaine hydrochloride for pain relief outside of a medical setting?** A: Absolutely not.  Recreational use of cocaine is illegal and extremely dangerous, potentially leading to serious health consequences, addiction, and even death. This information pertains solely to its strictly controlled medical application.

* **Q: How should I store cocaine hydrochloride?** A:  This medication should be stored as directed by the healthcare provider and according to the label instructions.  Keep it out of reach of children and away from unauthorized access.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any unusual or concerning side effects to your healthcare provider immediately.  Some side effects can be serious and require prompt medical attention.

* **Q:  Is cocaine hydrochloride safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: No.  It's categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus exist.  Breastfeeding is not recommended following its use due to potential harm to the infant.
