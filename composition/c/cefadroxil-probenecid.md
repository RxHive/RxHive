# Cefadroxil + Probenecid
### Generic Name
Cefadroxil + Probenecid

**Note:**  Cefadroxil and Probenecid are typically prescribed as separate medications, not as a fixed-dose combination.  This information describes their individual actions and potential combined use as directed by a physician.  It's crucial to **never** mix medications without explicit instruction from a healthcare professional.


### Usage

**Cefadroxil:** This is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic.  Its primary use is to treat bacterial infections, particularly those affecting the respiratory tract (like bronchitis, pneumonia), skin and soft tissues (cellulitis, impetigo), urinary tract (cystitis, pyelonephritis), and ear infections (otitis media).  It's effective against a range of Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria.

**Probenecid:** This is a uricosuric agent, meaning it increases the excretion of uric acid from the body.  Its primary use is in the treatment of gout, a condition caused by a buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints. It's also used to prolong the effects of certain medications, such as penicillin, by reducing their renal excretion.


**Combined Use:** A doctor might prescribe Cefadroxil and Probenecid together when treating a bacterial infection in a patient also suffering from gout.  Probenecid can enhance the effectiveness of Cefadroxil by increasing its concentration in the blood, but this is a specialized approach and only undertaken with careful medical supervision.


### Dosage

**Cefadroxil:** Dosage varies significantly based on the infection's severity, the patient's weight and age, and the specific type of infection.  It is usually administered orally (tablets or capsules).  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose, which is typically given twice daily.  There are no IV formulations of Cefadroxil widely available.  Children's dosages are calculated based on weight and are always determined by a physician.

**Probenecid:**  This is also typically administered orally.  Dosage depends on the reason for prescription (gout or enhancing another drug's effect).  The usual adult dose for gout is 250-500mg twice daily,  but this can be adjusted.  Pediatric use of Probenecid is generally not recommended unless under strict medical guidance.  Again, IV formulations are not common.


**Combined Dosage:** The combined dosage of Cefadroxil and Probenecid is entirely determined by a physician based on the individual patient's condition and response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow prescribed dosages precisely.



### Side Effects

**Cefadroxil:**

* Common: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash.
* Less Common but Serious:  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), colitis (inflammation of the colon), changes in blood cell counts.

**Probenecid:**

* Common: Nausea, vomiting, headache, rash.
* Less Common but Serious: Kidney stones,  liver problems, hemolytic anemia.


**Combined Side Effects:** When taking both medications, the risk of side effects, especially gastrointestinal issues, may be increased.


**Always consult a healthcare provider if any adverse effects occur.**


### How it Works

**Cefadroxil:**  This antibiotic interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis, preventing bacteria from building and maintaining their cell walls. This ultimately leads to bacterial cell death.

**Probenecid:**  This drug inhibits the reabsorption of uric acid in the kidneys, leading to increased excretion of uric acid in the urine. It also blocks the renal tubular secretion of certain drugs, including some penicillins and cephalosporins (like Cefadroxil), thus increasing their blood levels and duration of action.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Individuals with allergies to cephalosporins or penicillin should not take Cefadroxil.  Those with allergies to Probenecid should avoid it.
* **Kidney Disease:** Both drugs are excreted by the kidneys.  Caution is necessary in patients with impaired kidney function, as dosage adjustments may be required.
* **Liver Disease:** Probenecid can affect liver function; caution is advised in patients with liver disease.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of both Cefadroxil and Probenecid during pregnancy and breastfeeding needs careful consideration and should only be done under strict medical guidance.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Cefadroxil and Probenecid can interact with other medications. Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Alcohol:**  Excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided while taking these medications.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I stop taking these medications if I feel better?**
A: No.  Always complete the prescribed course of treatment, even if symptoms improve. Stopping early can lead to recurring infection and antibiotic resistance.

**Q: How should I store these medications?**
A: Store both medications as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep out of reach of children.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
