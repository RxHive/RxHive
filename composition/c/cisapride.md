# Cisapride
### Generic Name
Cisapride

### Usage
Cisapride is primarily used for the symptomatic treatment of nocturnal heartburn caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  It's also sometimes used to treat gastrointestinal dysmotility, meaning problems with the movement of food through the digestive tract.  However, due to serious potential side effects (detailed below), its use is significantly restricted.  It is no longer widely available in many countries.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (GERD/Gastrointestinal Dysmotility):**  The usual starting dose is 5-10 mg taken four times a day (QID), at least 15 minutes before meals and at bedtime.  In some cases, the doctor may increase the dose to 20 mg per dose to achieve better results.  **However, this information is for reference only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for use.  Cisapride is rarely prescribed due to safety concerns.**

**Pediatric Dosage (GERD/Gastrointestinal Dysmotility):**  The dosage for infants, children, and adolescents is typically 0.15-0.2 mg/kg per dose, three to four times a day.  The maximum single dose should not exceed 10 mg. **This information is for reference only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for use.  Cisapride is rarely prescribed due to safety concerns.**


**Dosage Adjustments:**  For patients with hepatic (liver) impairment, the starting dose should be reduced to 50% of the usual adult dose.  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for renal (kidney) impairment; therefore, caution is advised if prescribing to patients with kidney problems.  **Again, this information is for reference only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for use.**

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those affecting your heart rhythm or breathing, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Cisapride enhances gastric motility (the movement of food through the stomach) and increases heart rate.  It achieves this by potentially releasing acetylcholine at the myenteric plexus (a network of nerves in the gut) and acting as a serotonin-4 receptor agonist.  This means it stimulates specific receptors in the gut and heart to increase muscle contractions and heart rate.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Cisapride is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components; serious cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular fibrillation, torsades de pointes, QT prolongation); a history of prolonged QT syndrome; a history of renal failure, ventricular arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, clinically significant bradycardia, or uncorrected electrolyte disorders; and concomitant use with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of arrhythmias.

**Warnings:** Cisapride carries a high risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.  It's crucial to avoid concurrent use with drugs known to prolong the QT interval or inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme (which metabolizes cisapride).  Grapefruit juice should also be avoided as it can interact with the medication.  Cisapride should be used with extreme caution in patients with renal impairment, and its use during breastfeeding should be carefully considered.  The potential benefits must be carefully weighed against the serious risks before prescribing to individuals who might develop prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals or those at risk for serious arrhythmias.

**Drug Interactions:** Cisapride interacts with numerous medications, including those that prolong the QT interval, inhibit CYP3A4, or affect electrolyte balance.  This can significantly increase the risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. Always inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking.

### FAQs
**Q: How should I store cisapride?**
A: Store cisapride as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: Can I take cisapride with other medications?**
A:  No, you should not take cisapride with other medications without first consulting your doctor.  Many medications interact dangerously with cisapride, significantly increasing the risk of serious side effects, especially cardiac arrhythmias.

**Q: Is cisapride safe for pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers?**
A:  The safety of cisapride during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Its use should be carefully considered and only prescribed when the benefits significantly outweigh the potential risks.

**Q: How long does it take cisapride to work?**
A: The onset of action and duration of effect vary depending on the individual and the specific condition being treated.  Consult your doctor for personalized guidance.

**Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A:  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.  Consult your physician for guidance.

**Important Disclaimer:**  This information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.  Cisapride carries significant risks and is rarely prescribed due to its potential to cause serious cardiac side effects.  Always consult a healthcare professional before taking any medication, and strictly follow their recommendations for dosage and administration.
