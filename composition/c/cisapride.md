# Cisapride

**Generic Name:** Cisapride

**Usage:**  Cisapride is a prokinetic agent. Its primary use was in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and symptoms of slow stomach emptying (gastroparesis).  However, due to serious cardiovascular side effects, it is **no longer widely available in most countries**.  Its use is largely restricted to situations where other treatments have failed and the potential benefits outweigh the significant risks.  Any use should be under strict medical supervision.

**Side Effects:** Cisapride carries a significant risk of serious, even life-threatening, side effects, primarily involving the heart. These include:

* **QT interval prolongation:** This is a lengthening of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), which can lead to potentially fatal arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.
* **Ventricular tachycardia/Torsades de pointes:**  Rapid, irregular heartbeats that can be life-threatening.
* **Cardiac arrest:**  Complete cessation of heart function.
* **Other side effects:** While less serious than the cardiovascular effects, other potential side effects include diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.


**How it Works:** Cisapride stimulates the release of serotonin in the gastrointestinal tract. Serotonin increases the motility (movement) of the stomach and intestines, promoting the emptying of the stomach and improving the passage of food through the digestive system. This helps relieve symptoms of GERD and gastroparesis.  The mechanism by which it leads to QT prolongation is related to its effects on the heart's electrical activity through interactions with potassium channels.

**FAQs:**

* **Is Cisapride still available?**  In many countries, cisapride is no longer available due to its serious cardiac side effects.  Access is highly restricted.
* **What are the alternatives to Cisapride?** Many other medications are available to treat GERD and gastroparesis, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2 blockers, and other prokinetic agents (though with different mechanisms and side effect profiles).  A doctor should determine the most appropriate alternative.
* **Is Cisapride safe?** No, cisapride carries a significant risk of serious cardiac side effects and should only be used under strict medical supervision in exceptional circumstances.
* **Why was Cisapride withdrawn from the market?**  It was withdrawn due to the unacceptable risk of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias.
* **Can I take Cisapride with other medications?**  Interaction with other drugs that can prolong the QT interval can significantly increase the risk of serious side effects.  A doctor must be consulted about all medications before considering cisapride (even if it were accessible).
