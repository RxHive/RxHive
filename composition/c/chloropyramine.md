# Chloropyramine
### Generic Name
Chloropyramine

### Usage

Chloropyramine is a first-generation antihistamine primarily used to treat allergic conditions.  Its main applications include allergic conjunctivitis (eye inflammation due to allergies), allergic rhinitis (hay fever), and, to a lesser extent, bronchial asthma and other atopic (allergic) diseases.  It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions.  While it can help manage symptoms, it's not a cure for these conditions.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the severity of the condition, the patient's age, and the form of medication (oral, intravenous/intramuscular, or topical).  Always follow a doctor's prescription precisely.  The following are examples and may not be comprehensive:

**Adults (Severe Allergic Reactions):**

* **Oral:** 25 mg can be taken twice to four times daily (75-100 mg/day).
* **Intravenous/Intramuscular:** 20-40 mg/day (1-2 ampules).
* **Topical (Cream/ointment 1%):** Apply a thin layer to the affected area once or several times a day as directed.


**Children (Severe Allergic Reactions):**

* **Ages 3-6 years:** 1/2 tablet (12.5 mg) twice daily (total daily dose of 25 mg).
* **Ages 6-14 years:** 1/2 tablet (12.5 mg) three times daily (25-37.5 mg/day).
* **Ages 14-18 years:** 1 tablet (25 mg) three or four times daily (75-100 mg/day).

**Note:**  The maximum dose for children should not exceed 2 mg per kilogram of body weight.  Dosage adjustments may be needed for patients with liver or kidney problems.

### How it Works

Chloropyramine is a competitive reversible H1-receptor antagonist (also known as an H1 inverse agonist).  This means it blocks the histamine receptors in the body. Histamine is a chemical that causes the symptoms of allergic reactions, such as inflammation, itching, and swelling. By preventing histamine from binding to its receptors, chloropyramine reduces these symptoms.  It also has some anticholinergic properties, meaning it can block the actions of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in various bodily functions including those in the gut and eyes.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Chloropyramine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or related compounds, benign prostatic hyperplasia, peptic ulcers, pyloric or duodenal stenosis, uncontrolled glaucoma, an acute asthma attack, during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and in children under 3 years old.
* **Cautious Use:**  Use with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular diseases, and in elderly or malnourished individuals.
* **Drug Interactions:** Chloropyramine can interact with other medications, including atropine, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), alcohol, sedatives, and hypnotics.  Concurrent use should be discussed with a healthcare professional.  It can potentiate the sedative effects of these drugs.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Chloropyramine is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
