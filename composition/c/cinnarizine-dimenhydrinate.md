# Cinnarizine + Dimenhydrinate
### Generic Name
Cinnarizine + Dimenhydrinate

### Usage
Cinnarizine + Dimenhydrinate is a combination medication used primarily to treat vertigo (a sensation of spinning or dizziness) and nausea associated with various conditions affecting the inner ear and balance system.  It's often prescribed for Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis (inflammation of the inner ear), and other vestibular disorders.  While its primary use targets these inner ear problems, it may also be used to help manage nausea and vomiting caused by motion sickness or other conditions.  It's important to note that this combination is not a first-line treatment for all forms of nausea and vomiting; a doctor will determine its suitability based on the specific cause and severity of symptoms.

### Dosage
Dosage for Cinnarizine + Dimenhydrinate varies depending on the individual's age, weight, the specific condition being treated, and the doctor's assessment.  There isn't a standardized universal dosage, and formulations may differ. Therefore, it's crucial to follow the prescription instructions precisely.

* **Adults (Oral):**  The typical adult dose is usually one to two tablets or capsules multiple times a day, as directed by a physician. The exact dosage and frequency will be determined based on individual needs and response.

* **Children (Oral):** The use of this combination medication in children is generally not recommended without specific guidance from a pediatrician.  The medication may not be appropriate or safely administered in children, depending on their age and weight.

* **IV Administration:** This combination medication is not typically given intravenously (IV). It is usually administered orally.

**Important Note:**  Always follow the dosage instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Never exceed the recommended dose.

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Cinnarizine and Dimenhydrinate work through different mechanisms to address the symptoms of vertigo and nausea:

* **Cinnarizine:** This is a calcium channel blocker that primarily affects the blood vessels in the inner ear. By reducing blood vessel constriction, it helps to improve blood flow and reduce the symptoms associated with inner ear problems. It also possesses some antihistaminic effects.

* **Dimenhydrinate:** This is an antihistamine with anticholinergic and antiemetic properties. It works by blocking histamine receptors in the brain, reducing nausea and vomiting. The anticholinergic effect helps to control some of the inner ear's signals that might be contributing to dizziness.

Together, these two drugs work synergistically to provide relief from both vertigo and nausea.
