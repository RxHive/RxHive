# Cinnarizine + Dimenhydrinate

**Generic Name:** Cinnarizine + Dimenhydrinate

**Usage:** This combination medication is primarily used to treat vertigo (a sensation of spinning or dizziness) and nausea associated with inner ear problems, such as Meniere's disease or labyrinthitis.  It may also be used to treat motion sickness and nausea and vomiting after surgery or due to other causes.  **It's crucial to note that this combination is not commonly prescribed in many parts of the world, and its use should be guided by a physician.**  Other medications are typically preferred for these conditions.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, fatigue, headache.
* **Less Common:**  Dizziness, incoordination, difficulty urinating, changes in appetite, weight gain.
* **Serious (though rare):**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing),  severe drowsiness or sedation,  extrapyramidal symptoms (involuntary muscle movements).  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**

**How it Works:**

* **Cinnarizine:** This is a calcium channel blocker with antihistamine-like properties. It works by reducing the effects of histamine in the inner ear and reducing the flow of calcium into nerve cells, thereby lessening the symptoms of vertigo and nausea.
* **Dimenhydrinate:** This is an antihistamine with anticholinergic and antiemetic properties. It blocks the action of histamine in the brain, reducing nausea and vomiting, and also has a calming effect that can alleviate dizziness. The combination of these two drugs provides a synergistic effect, meaning their combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects.
