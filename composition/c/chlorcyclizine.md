# Chlorcyclizine
### Generic Name
Chlorcyclizine

### Usage
Chlorcyclizine is primarily an antihistamine, most often used to provide temporary relief from symptoms associated with hay fever or other upper respiratory allergies. These symptoms include runny nose, sneezing, itching of the nose or throat, and itchy or watery eyes.  It's also frequently found in combination with other medications to treat nasal congestion and cough.  The specific combinations often include pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, or chlophendianol.  While it can relieve symptoms, it doesn't treat the underlying cause of the allergy.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  The following dosage information is for general guidance only.  Always follow the directions on your prescription label and consult your doctor or pharmacist for personalized advice.  Dosage may vary depending on the specific formulation (tablet, liquid), the presence of other medications in the formulation, and the patient's age and overall health.

**Adults:**

* **Hay fever/upper respiratory allergies (single agent):** 25 mg orally every 6-8 hours, not exceeding 3 tablets (75mg) within 24 hours.
* **Nasal congestion (combination products):** Dosage varies greatly depending on the combination and specific product.  Always refer to the product label for exact instructions.  Typical ranges are 25-60 mg every 6-8 hours, not to exceed 3 doses per day for tablets; and 9.375-30mg/5mL every 6 hours for liquid, not exceeding 40 mL/day.

**Children:**  Dosage for children is significantly lower and depends heavily on age and weight. It's crucial to consult a pediatrician or follow the instructions on the child's medication packaging carefully.  Dosages for children in combination products are even more variable and must be determined from the product-specific directions.  Use in children under 6 is generally not recommended for some formulations.


**Administration:**  Chlorcyclizine is typically administered orally, either as a tablet or liquid.  Chewable tablets should be chewed thoroughly before swallowing.

### How it Works

Chlorcyclizine is an antihistamine that works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that's released during allergic reactions.  By binding to histamine H1 receptors, chlorcyclizine prevents histamine from causing the symptoms of allergies like runny nose, sneezing, itching, and watery eyes.  It also possesses anticholinergic properties, which can contribute to some of its side effects (e.g., dry mouth).

* **Interactions:** Chlorcyclizine can interact with several other medications, including CNS depressants (e.g., barbiturates, opioids), MAO inhibitors, betahistine, and ototoxic drugs.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
