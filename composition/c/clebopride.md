# Clebopride
### Generic Name
Clebopride

### Usage
Clebopride is primarily used to treat functional gastrointestinal disorders characterized by nausea and vomiting, and acid reflux.  It acts as both an antiemetic (prevents vomiting) and a prokinetic agent (improves gut motility).  While its primary use focuses on these gastrointestinal issues, research suggests potential applications in other areas, though these remain less established.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Nausea and Vomiting; Acid Reflux:**
    * **Oral:** 500 mcg three times a day (TID).
    * **Intravenous (IV) / Intramuscular (IM):** 0.5-1 mg for acute symptoms.  Dosage adjustments for IV/IM administration should be guided by a healthcare professional.

**Children:**

* **Nausea and Vomiting; Acid Reflux:** Oral: 15-20 mcg/kg TID.  Precise dosage for children should always be determined by a pediatrician or healthcare provider, taking into account the child's weight and specific condition.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Use in patients with impaired kidney function should be approached with caution, under close medical supervision.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Drowsiness, diarrhea, dizziness, headache.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Extrapyramidal symptoms (involuntary muscle movements), restlessness, hypotension (low blood pressure), hypertension (high blood pressure), depression, galactorrhea (abnormal milk production), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a rare but potentially life-threatening condition).

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious,  contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Clebopride primarily works by blocking dopamine D2 receptors, specifically the presynaptic D2 autoreceptors, in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  In the GI tract, this blockade enhances gut motility and reduces nausea and vomiting.  The exact mechanisms by which clebopride achieves its antiemetic and prokinetic effects are complex and involve interactions with various neurotransmitters and pathways.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Clebopride is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, those with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, obstruction, or perforation, and those who have recently undergone gastrointestinal surgery.  It is also contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland).
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients using clebopride may have an increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with impaired renal function, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, a history of depression, and in pediatric and geriatric patients.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concurrent use with lithium should be avoided due to the potential for lithium toxicity.  Concurrent use with antimuscarinic drugs and opioid analgesics should also be avoided due to possible antagonism.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of clebopride during pregnancy and lactation is not fully established. Use during these periods should only be considered if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks, and only under strict medical supervision.


### FAQs
