# Clebopride

**Generic Name:** Clebopride

**Usage:**  Clebopride is **not** currently available as a generic medication in many parts of the world, including the US.  It was a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist with potential uses similar to other antiemetics and prokinetics, primarily for treating nausea and vomiting and possibly gastrointestinal motility disorders. However, due to safety concerns, it was largely withdrawn from the market.  Therefore, its usage is largely historical and not a current clinical practice in most places.  Any information provided about its usage would be based on past research and may not be accurate or reliable for current medical advice.

**Side Effects:**  Based on past studies, clebopride could cause a range of side effects, many of which are related to its action on the dopamine system. These could include:

* **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):** This is a significant concern and includes dystonia (muscle spasms), akathisia (restlessness), parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity), and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements, potentially irreversible).
* **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):** A rare but life-threatening condition characterized by fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
* **Cardiac effects:**  Changes in heart rhythm (QT prolongation) were a concern.
* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea.
* **Other:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, headache, dry mouth.

**How it Works:** Clebopride, as a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, primarily works by blocking the action of dopamine in the brain and gastrointestinal tract.  By blocking dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brainstem, it reduces nausea and vomiting.  Its effects on gastrointestinal motility are likely due to its interactions with dopamine receptors in the gut.


**FAQs:**

* **Is clebopride still available?** No, it's not widely available due to safety concerns.
* **What are the alternatives?**  Many safer and more effective antiemetics and prokinetics are available, including metoclopramide (though this also carries risks), ondansetron, domperidone (again, with potential risks), and others. Your doctor can advise on appropriate alternatives based on your individual needs and medical history.
* **Why was clebopride withdrawn?**  Its use was significantly curtailed due to concerns over the risk of serious side effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms and cardiac arrhythmias.
* **Should I take clebopride?** No.  Do not attempt to obtain or use clebopride without explicit guidance from a doctor.  Safer and more effective alternatives are available.
