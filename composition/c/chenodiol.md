# Chenodiol
### Generic Name
Chenodiol (Chenodeoxycholic Acid)

### Usage

Chenodiol is primarily used to dissolve cholesterol gallstones in the gallbladder.  It's considered an alternative to surgery for carefully selected patients.  The decision to use chenodiol is made based on several factors, including the size, composition, and number of gallstones, as well as the patient's overall health.  It's important to note that chenodiol is not effective for all types of gallstones; it works best on small, radiolucent (not visible on X-ray) cholesterol stones.  

Off-label uses of chenodiol exist, primarily in the treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare inherited disorder affecting cholesterol metabolism.  However, its use in CTX is generally considered secondary to other treatment options, and should only be pursued under the guidance of a specialist.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's characteristics.  Always follow the prescription provided by your doctor.  There is no standard pediatric dosage for gallstone dissolution, making it unsuitable for that purpose in children.

**Gallstone Dissolution (Adult):**

* **Initial Phase:** The typical starting dose is 250 mg twice daily (BID) for the first two weeks.  
* **Titration:** The dose may be gradually increased by 250 mg daily until the optimal dose (generally 13-16 mg/kg/day in two divided doses) is reached or until side effects become intolerable.  Lower doses are generally ineffective.
* **Combination Therapy (Off-label):**  Lower doses (5-7.5 mg/kg/day once daily at bedtime) may be used in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid, sometimes with additional lithotripsy.


**Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (Adult & Pediatric):**

* **Adults:**  A typical dose is 750 mg/day divided into three doses, for at least a year.
* **Children & Adolescents:** The dose is usually 10-15 mg/kg/day, divided into 1-3 doses. The maximum daily dose is 750 mg.

**Pediatric Gallstone Dissolution (off-label):**

Chenodiol isn't typically used for gallstones in children due to its side effects and the availability of other, safer treatment methods. If used, a dose of 15 mg/kg/day divided into three doses with meals may be considered for children 12 years and older; however, this is not a widely accepted practice.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are generally not recommended for renal impairment.  For hepatic impairment, the drug is contraindicated due to the risk of worsening liver conditions.  If liver enzyme levels rise during treatment, the dose may need to be temporarily reduced or stopped altogether.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain or cramps
* Nausea and vomiting
* Increased cholesterol levels
* Elevated liver enzymes (transaminases)

Less common, but serious side effects may include:

* Severe liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)


**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially those affecting your liver or digestive system,  contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Chenodiol is a bile acid that helps dissolve cholesterol gallstones.  It achieves this by reducing the amount of cholesterol produced by the liver and secreted into the bile. This alteration in bile composition makes it less likely to form stones and may even dissolve existing stones over time.  In CTX, it helps to regulate bile acid metabolism, addressing a key aspect of the disease process.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Chenodiol is contraindicated in individuals with pre-existing liver disease, bile duct abnormalities, radiopaque gallstones, or gallbladder complications.  It's also absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy (Category X).
* **Interactions:**  Chenodiol may interact with several medications, including bile acid sequestrants, estrogen derivatives, fibric acid derivatives, and warfarin.  This can affect the effectiveness or safety of one or both drugs.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Chenodiol is contraindicated during pregnancy. Its use during breastfeeding should be approached with caution as excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Hepatotoxicity:**  Regular monitoring of liver function (liver enzymes) is crucial during treatment due to the risk of liver damage.
* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with a history of diarrhea should use caution, as chenodiol can worsen this symptom.  Close monitoring of cholesterol levels is also advised.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to dissolve gallstones with chenodiol?**  A:  It can take many months, even a year or more, for gallstones to dissolve completely, and not all stones respond to treatment. Regular monitoring is necessary.

* **Q: What if my gallstones don't dissolve?** A: If there is no response to treatment after a certain period (usually 18 months), the doctor will likely recommend alternative treatment options such as surgery.

* **Q: How should I store chenodiol?** A:  Store chenodiol as directed on the prescription label.  Generally, this involves storing it in a cool, dry place away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of using chenodiol?** A: Long-term effects are not fully understood, but liver function monitoring is crucial to assess for adverse effects. Gallstone recurrence is also possible after treatment.

* **Q:  Can I take chenodiol with other medications?** A:  This depends on the specific medications you take. Always discuss any other medications or supplements with your doctor before starting chenodiol treatment to avoid potential interactions.
