# Cyclothiazide
### Generic Name
Cyclothiazide

### Usage
Cyclothiazide is a benzothiadiazide diuretic primarily used as an adjunctive therapy in managing edema (swelling due to fluid retention) associated with various conditions.  These include congestive heart failure (a condition where the heart can't pump enough blood), hepatic cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), and conditions where edema is caused by corticosteroid or estrogen therapy.  It's also indicated in the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure).  Essentially, it helps the body eliminate excess water and sodium, reducing fluid buildup and blood pressure.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Edema:** The usual starting oral dose is 1-2 mg once daily, preferably in the morning.  The maintenance dose might be reduced to 1-2 mg every other day or 2-3 times a week, depending on individual response and physician recommendation.
* **Hypertension:** A typical starting dose is 2 mg daily. This may be increased to 4-6 mg daily if needed, under strict medical supervision.


**Children:**

* **Edema/Hypertension:** The oral dose is calculated based on weight or body surface area.  A typical range is 0.02-0.04 mg/kg per 24 hours, or 0.6-1.2 mg/mÂ² per 24 hours, given as a single daily dose in the morning.  Dosage adjustments are often necessary based on the child's response and should always be determined by a pediatrician.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with these conditions, and close monitoring is crucial.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Vertigo (spinning sensation)
* Headache
* Xanthopsia (yellow vision)
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Cardiac dysrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)
* Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing)
* Skin rashes (purpura, urticaria)
* Photosensitivity (increased sun sensitivity)
* Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, constipation)
* Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, hypomagnesemia)

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Necrotizing angiitis (inflammation of blood vessels)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Aplastic anemia (a severe bone marrow failure)
* Agranulocytosis (a dangerous drop in white blood cells)
* Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes)
* Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Cyclothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that primarily works by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions in the early distal tubules of the kidneys.  This increased excretion of sodium and chloride leads to increased excretion of water, reducing fluid volume and blood pressure.  It also impacts potassium excretion through the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism, potentially leading to hypokalemia (low potassium levels). Its antihypertensive effects may also involve actions on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cyclothiazide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to cyclothiazide, sulfonamide-derived drugs, or any component of the formulation, and in patients with anuria (absence of urine production).
* **Cautions:** Exercise caution in patients with electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia, hyponatremia), history of allergy or bronchial asthma, diabetes mellitus, hyperuricemia, liver disease, renal disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and in breastfeeding women.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Several drug interactions exist.  Concurrent use with ACE inhibitors can increase hypotension risk. Beta-blockers can enhance hyperglycemic effects.  Cyclosporine increases the risk of gout or renal toxicity. Digoxin toxicity is exacerbated by induced hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia. Lithium toxicity can be worsened.  Neuromuscular blocking agents' effects are prolonged. NSAIDs can reduce cyclothiazide's effectiveness.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take cyclothiazide with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible.
* **Q: How should I store cyclothiazide?** A: Store as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking cyclothiazide suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping can be harmful.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually tapering off the medication.
* **Q: Is cyclothiazide safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  Diuretics are generally avoided during pregnancy.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution if breastfeeding is necessary and only after consultation with your doctor.
