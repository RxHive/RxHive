# Ciclesonide (Oral inhalation)
### Generic Name
Ciclesonide (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage
Ciclesonide, administered via oral inhalation, is primarily used for the long-term, preventative treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older.  It's a corticosteroid that helps reduce inflammation in the airways, making breathing easier and preventing asthma attacks.  It's crucial to understand that ciclesonide is *not* for treating acute asthma attacks (sudden shortness of breath);  a quick-relief inhaler (bronchodilator) is needed for that.  Ciclesonide's role is to control inflammation and prevent those attacks from happening in the first place.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (12 years and older):** Dosage depends on the individual's asthma severity and prior treatment.  The medication comes as an aerosol solution in inhalers delivering either 80 mcg or 160 mcg per actuation, or 100 mcg or 200 mcg per actuation (depending on formulation and country).  

* **Patients with prior bronchodilator-only treatment:** Typically start with 80 mcg twice daily (BID). The maximum dose is usually 160 mcg BID.
* **Patients with prior inhaled corticosteroid treatment:** Usually start with 80 mcg BID; the maximum dose may be higher, up to 320 mcg BID.
* **Patients with prior oral corticosteroid treatment:** May start at a higher dose, such as 320 mcg BID, and the maximum dose remains 320 mcg BID.

The dose is adjusted based on response.  It may be increased after four weeks if asthma isn't adequately controlled, but always aiming for the lowest effective dose.  In some cases of mild to moderate asthma flare-ups, a healthcare provider may temporarily increase the dose (e.g., quadrupling it) for a short period (up to 14 days).  This is not appropriate for all patients and should only be considered under specific circumstances and medical guidance.  

**Pediatric Dosage (2-11 years):**  Dosage for younger children (2-11 years) varies depending on the specific formulation and healthcare provider's assessment; usually starting at lower doses (e.g., 40 mcg once daily) and increasing as needed.  Dosages for children aged 6-11 and adolescents (12 years and older) are usually guided by the same principles of titrating to the lowest effective dose,  similar to adults, but starting doses may be lower.  Always follow the precise instructions from your child's doctor or pharmacist.

**Important Note:** The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines provide further recommendations for dosage adjustments depending on severity.  It is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized dosage guidance.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat)


**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing)
* Oral thrush (candidiasis)
* Voice changes (hoarseness)
* Facial swelling
* Increased risk of infections
* Adrenal suppression (long-term high doses)

If any significant or concerning side effects develop, seek medical advice immediately.

### How it Works

Ciclesonide is a prodrug; this means it's converted into its active form (des-ciclesonide) in the body. Des-ciclesonide is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the airways. It works by binding to specific receptors in the cells of the lungs, decreasing the production of substances that cause inflammation and narrowing of the airways. This leads to improved breathing and reduces the frequency and severity of asthma attacks.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ciclesonide is contraindicated for those with hypersensitivity to the medication, those experiencing acute severe asthma (status asthmaticus),  or those with untreated respiratory infections.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Some medications can interact with ciclesonide, altering its effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  Notify your doctor about all medications you're taking.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, for instance, may interact.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ciclesonide is categorized as pregnancy category C (risk cannot be ruled out). While inhaled corticosteroids are generally considered safe during pregnancy for treating asthma,  the lowest effective dose should always be used.  The drug's excretion in breast milk is unknown; consult your doctor before use during breastfeeding.
* **Special Populations:**  Children and older adults may require careful dose adjustment and monitoring.  Patients with weakened immune systems should be monitored closely for infections.  Thereâ€™s a potential risk of bone thinning (osteoporosis) with long-term use of high doses.
* **Other Precautions:**  Use caution in patients with glaucoma or cataracts.  Always rinse your mouth after inhaling to reduce the risk of oral thrush.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use ciclesonide for a sudden asthma attack?** A: No, ciclesonide is a preventative medication.  Use a quick-relief inhaler (bronchodilator) for acute symptoms.
* **Q: How should I store ciclesonide?** A: Store at room temperature, away from heat and open flame.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking ciclesonide suddenly?** A: No, gradually reduce the dose under your doctor's supervision to prevent potential withdrawal effects.
* **Q:  Can ciclesonide affect my growth?** A: In children, long-term use of high doses might affect growth.  Regular monitoring is crucial.
