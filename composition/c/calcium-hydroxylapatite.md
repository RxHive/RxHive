# Calcium Hydroxylapatite
### Generic Name
Calcium Hydroxylapatite

### Usage

Calcium hydroxylapatite is a subdermal implant primarily used to correct moderate-to-severe facial wrinkles and folds, such as nasolabial folds.  It's also indicated for restoring or correcting facial fat loss (lipoatrophy) in individuals with HIV and for addressing volume loss on the back of the hands.  Essentially, it's used to add volume and smooth out areas where tissue has thinned or aged.

### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and depends on the treatment area and desired cosmetic outcome.  There isn't a fixed amount.

**Facial Wrinkles:** The amount injected subdermally varies depending on the location and the extent of correction needed.  A 1:1 correction factor is recommended, meaning you shouldn't overfill the area.  Repeat treatments may be necessary.

**Hand Augmentation:**  For hand augmentation, injections are given in small boluses (0.2-0.5 mL per bolus, with a maximum of 0.5 mL per bolus). The maximum volume per hand per treatment session is 3 mL.  Repeat treatments may be given, but larger volumes (over 1.6 mL per hand) in subsequent sessions increase the risk of side effects. A 1:1 correction factor should be applied here as well.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of calcium hydroxylapatite in children haven't been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### How it Works

Calcium hydroxylapatite is injected subdermally (below the skin).  It works by adding volume to the treated area, thus filling in wrinkles, folds, or areas of volume loss. This improves the appearance of facial wrinkles or restores volume to the hands. The exact mechanism of how it reduces the depth of wrinkles or corrects volume loss is not fully understood.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to calcium hydroxylapatite or any component of the formulation.
* Severe allergies (history of anaphylaxis or multiple severe allergies).
* Bleeding disorders.
* Hypersensitivity to lidocaine or other amide-type anesthetics (if used during injection).

**Increased Risk:**

* Injection-site reactions.
* Vascular occlusion (blockage of blood vessels).

**Use with Caution:**

* When co-administered with medications that prolong bleeding.
* In patients with autoimmune diseases affecting the hand, hand implants, Dupuytren's contracture, history of hand tumors, vascular malformations, Raynaud's disease, or risk of tendon rupture.
* In patients with Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI (darker skin tones).
* Pregnancy Category C:  Animal studies have shown adverse effects on the fetus.  The risk to humans is unknown.  It's unclear whether it's excreted in breast milk.
