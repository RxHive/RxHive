# Chorionic Gonadotropin
### Generic Name
Chorionic Gonadotropin

### Usage

Chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone naturally produced during pregnancy.  Medically, it's used primarily to induce ovulation and pregnancy in women who have difficulty conceiving. This typically involves using hCG as a final trigger after other fertility treatments like follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) therapy have prepared the ovaries.  It works by mimicking the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that naturally triggers the release of a mature egg.

Beyond fertility treatment, hCG also plays a role in treating certain male reproductive issues. It can help stimulate spermatogenesis (sperm production) in men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, a condition where the body doesn't produce enough hormones to stimulate the testes to function properly.  Finally, it is sometimes used in the treatment of prepubertal cryptorchidism (undescended testicles) in boys, although its efficacy in this area is subject to ongoing discussion.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's age, and the form of the medication (usually injection).  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

**Adult Dosage (examples, not exhaustive):**

* **Induction of Ovulation:**  Doses range widely depending on the specific fertility treatment plan; your doctor will determine the correct dosage. For example, Ovidrel (a brand name) might be administered as a 250 mcg subcutaneous injection.
* **Induction of Spermatogenesis (males):**  This often involves 1000-2000 units injected 2-3 times per week, for several months, potentially in conjunction with other medications.

**Pediatric Dosage (examples, not exhaustive):**

* **Prepubertal Cryptorchidism:** Dosage is highly variable and determined by the treating physician, ranging from 500-4000 units administered multiple times per week or every other day for several weeks or months.

**Important Note:**  The above examples are only illustrative.  Never administer hCG without specific instructions from a healthcare professional.  Incorrect dosage can lead to serious health consequences.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (frequency varies depending on the specific product and dosage):**

* Ovarian cysts
* Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) â€“ a serious complication
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Irritability
* Depression
* Edema (swelling)
* Thromboembolism (blood clot)
* Gynecomastia (breast development in males)

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly severe or persistent ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

hCG is a glycoprotein hormone that binds to LH receptors in the body.  In women, this triggers the final maturation of follicles in the ovaries, leading to ovulation (release of an egg).  In men, it stimulates the Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone, which is essential for sperm production.  The precise mechanism of action in cryptorchidism is less clearly defined, but it may involve stimulation of testicular descent.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  hCG is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the medication, primary ovarian failure, uncontrolled thyroid or adrenal dysfunction, uncontrolled organic intracranial lesions, undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding, ovarian cysts of undetermined origin, sex hormone-dependent tumors, or pregnancy.
* **Interactions:**  hCG can interact with other medications, so it's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  hCG is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it's contraindicated during pregnancy.  It's also not recommended for breastfeeding mothers due to potential excretion in breast milk.
* **Other Precautions:**  Individuals with a history of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome or thromboembolic disorders should exercise particular caution.  The risk of multiple births is increased with hCG use in fertility treatments.


### FAQs

**Q: How is hCG administered?**  A: It's usually administered via intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.

**Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effects depend on the condition being treated and the dosage.  For ovulation induction, the egg release typically occurs within 24-36 hours after injection.

**Q: How should hCG be stored?** A: Store as directed on the product label; usually refrigeration is required.

**Q: Are there any long-term side effects?** A: Long-term side effects are rare but can include those already mentioned.  Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is essential.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately for guidance on missed doses.  Do not attempt to double up on doses.
