# Cyproterone + Ethinyl Estradiol

**Generic Name:** Cyproterone Acetate + Ethinylestradiol

**Usage:**

Cyproterone Acetate + Ethinylestradiol is a combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) primarily used for:

* **Contraception:**  Preventing pregnancy by suppressing ovulation (release of eggs) and thickening cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg.
* **Treatment of acne and hirsutism (excessive hair growth) in women:**  Cyproterone acetate is an anti-androgen, meaning it reduces the effects of male hormones (androgens) in the body. This helps to improve acne and reduce excessive hair growth.
* **Treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD):**  In some cases, this combination may be prescribed to help manage severe symptoms of PMDD.
* **Treatment of endometriosis:**  In certain situations, it may be used to manage the symptoms of endometriosis.

**Important Note:** The use of this medication for conditions other than contraception should only be under the direct supervision of a doctor.  It's not suitable for all women and contraindications exist.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common:**  Breast tenderness, weight changes (gain or loss), mood changes (including depression or anxiety), headache, nausea, vomiting, bloating, changes in menstrual bleeding (spotting, heavier or lighter periods, amenorrhea), decreased libido.
* **Less common but serious:**  Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), stroke, heart attack, liver problems, high blood pressure, gallbladder disease, changes in glucose tolerance.
* **Rare but serious:**  Serious allergic reactions, jaundice.


**How it Works:**

Cyproterone acetate is a progestogen (synthetic progesterone) with anti-androgenic properties. It suppresses ovulation and alters cervical mucus.  Ethinylestradiol is an estrogen that further suppresses ovulation, thins the uterine lining, and regulates the menstrual cycle. The combination of these two hormones provides effective contraception and addresses hormonal imbalances related to acne and hirsutism.
