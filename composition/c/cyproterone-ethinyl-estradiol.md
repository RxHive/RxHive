# Cyproterone + Ethinyl Estradiol
### Generic Name
Cyproterone Acetate + Ethinyl Estradiol

### Usage

Cyproterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol is a combined oral contraceptive pill primarily used for birth control.  It prevents pregnancy by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary) and thickening the cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm to reach and fertilize an egg.  Beyond contraception, this combination is also sometimes prescribed to treat moderate to severe acne in women and hirsutism (excessive hair growth) associated with hormonal imbalances.  It's important to note that its use for conditions beyond contraception should be under strict medical supervision.


### Dosage

Dosage is strictly determined by a physician and varies depending on the specific formulation and individual needs.  There is no standard dosage for children, as this medication is not typically used in pediatric populations.  The usual adult dosage involves taking one tablet daily, at approximately the same time each day, following the specific cycle outlined on the packaging.  Missed pills can significantly reduce effectiveness, so carefully adhering to the prescribed schedule is critical.  There are no IV forms of this combined medication.

### How it Works

This medication works through a combined hormonal effect. Cyproterone acetate is a progestin (a synthetic form of progesterone) that suppresses ovulation and reduces the production of androgens (male hormones) which contribute to acne and hirsutism. Ethinyl estradiol is an estrogen that further suppresses ovulation, thickens cervical mucus, and helps regulate the menstrual cycle. The combined action of these hormones effectively prevents pregnancy and addresses some hormonal imbalances.



### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used by individuals with certain medical conditions, including but not limited to blood clots, stroke, heart attack, liver disease, breast cancer, or undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.  
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Several medications can interact with cyproterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol.  Inform your doctor about all medications, herbal supplements, and over-the-counter drugs you are taking.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** This medication is not intended for use during pregnancy and should be discontinued immediately if pregnancy occurs. It is generally not recommended during breastfeeding as the hormones can pass into breast milk.
*   **Older Adults:**  The use of this medication in older adults should be carefully evaluated due to potential increased risk of certain side effects.
*   **Smoking:** Smoking significantly increases the risk of blood clots and other cardiovascular problems associated with this medication.
