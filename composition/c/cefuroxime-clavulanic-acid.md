# Cefuroxime + Clavulanic Acid

**Generic Name:** Cefuroxime Axetil and Clavulanate Potassium

**Usage:**

Cefuroxime axetil and clavulanate potassium is a combination antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections.  The cefuroxime part is a cephalosporin antibiotic that works against a range of bacteria.  The clavulanate potassium is a beta-lactamase inhibitor, meaning it helps the cefuroxime work better by preventing certain bacteria from breaking it down. This combination is effective against infections that are resistant to cefuroxime alone.  Common uses include:

* **Respiratory tract infections:** Bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis
* **Ear infections (otitis media):** Particularly in children.
* **Skin and skin structure infections:** Cellulitis, abscesses
* **Bone and joint infections:** Osteomyelitis
* **Urinary tract infections:**  Cystitis, pyelonephritis (depending on the causative organism and severity).

**Important Note:** This medication is only effective against bacterial infections, not viral infections like the common cold or flu.  Using antibiotics inappropriately can lead to antibiotic resistance.  Always consult a doctor to determine if this is the right medication for your infection.


**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, cefuroxime axetil and clavulanate potassium can cause side effects.  These vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
* **Headache**
* **Rash**
* **Vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis)**
* **Increased risk of bleeding (rare but possible)**
* **Allergic reactions:**  ranging from mild rash to serious anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction) - **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, or hives.**

Less common but more serious side effects can occur.  Always consult your doctor if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

Cefuroxime axetil is a cephalosporin antibiotic that works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  This ultimately leads to the death of the bacteria.  Clavulanate potassium inhibits beta-lactamases, enzymes produced by some bacteria that break down cephalosporins like cefuroxime. By inhibiting these enzymes, clavulanate potassium allows the cefuroxime to be more effective against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking this medication, as it can increase the risk of side effects.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Can I take this medication while pregnant or breastfeeding?**  This should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding under strict medical supervision.  The benefits must outweigh the potential risks.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **What if I have an allergic reaction?**  Stop taking the medication immediately and seek immediate medical attention.
* **How long should I take this medication?**  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding the duration of treatment.  Do not stop taking the medication early, even if you feel better.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to recurrence of the infection and potential development of antibiotic resistance.
* **Can I take this with other medications?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as some may interact with cefuroxime axetil and clavulanate potassium.
