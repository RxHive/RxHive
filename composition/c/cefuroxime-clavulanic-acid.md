# Cefuroxime + Clavulanic Acid
### Generic Name
Cefuroxime Axetil and Clavulanate Potassium


### Usage

Cefuroxime axetil and clavulanate potassium is a combination antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections.  Cefuroxime axetil is a cephalosporin antibiotic that works by preventing bacteria from building cell walls, ultimately killing them. Clavulanate potassium is a beta-lactamase inhibitor; it prevents certain bacteria from breaking down the cefuroxime, thereby extending the antibiotic's effectiveness against a wider range of bacteria, including those resistant to other antibiotics.

This combination is primarily used for infections of the:

* **Respiratory tract:** This includes bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, and tonsillitis.  It's often effective against infections caused by bacteria like *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, and *Moraxella catarrhalis*.
* **Skin and soft tissues:**  It treats infections like cellulitis, abscesses, and wound infections.
* **Ear infections (otitis media):** Particularly in cases where other antibiotics have been ineffective or when the infection is severe.
* **Genitourinary tract infections (UTIs):**  While not the first-line treatment for all UTIs, it can be effective in certain cases.


It's important to note that this antibiotic is only effective against bacterial infections; it won't work against viral infections like the common cold or influenza.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the infection being treated, the patient's age, weight, and kidney function.  Always follow the prescription instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Never alter the dosage without consulting a healthcare professional.

**Oral Administration (Cefuroxime Axetil/Clavulanate Potassium tablets or suspensions):**

Dosage will be specified by your doctor based on your individual needs.  Typical adult dosages range from 250mg to 500mg of cefuroxime axetil twice daily, combined with a specified amount of clavulanate potassium. Pediatric dosages are significantly lower and determined by weight and the severity of the infection.  Liquid formulations are often used for children.

**Intravenous Administration (Cefuroxime and Clavulanate Potassium injection):**

IV administration requires a healthcare professional. Dosages and frequencies vary significantly based on the severity and type of infection and the patient's overall health.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash
* Vaginal yeast infection (in women)


Less common, but potentially serious, side effects:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild skin reactions to severe anaphylaxis - seek immediate medical attention if this occurs)
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (a potentially serious complication)
* Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine)
* Seizures (especially in patients with pre-existing conditions)


If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Cefuroxime axetil is a beta-lactam antibiotic.  It works by inhibiting the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  Without a properly formed cell wall, bacteria are unable to maintain their structure and ultimately die.  Clavulanate potassium inhibits the activity of beta-lactamases, enzymes produced by some bacteria that break down beta-lactam antibiotics like cefuroxime. By blocking beta-lactamases, clavulanate potassium allows cefuroxime to remain active and effective against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant to it.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Inform your doctor if you have any known allergies, especially to penicillin or other cephalosporin antibiotics. Cross-allergenicity between these types of antibiotics exists.
* **Kidney disease:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with kidney problems.
* **Liver disease:**  Use caution in patients with liver problems.  Your doctor may monitor liver function closely.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Use only as directed by a doctor.  The risks and benefits should be carefully considered.
* **Interactions:**  This medication may interact with other medications, including anticoagulants and oral contraceptives. Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid excessive alcohol consumption while taking this medication.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication with food?** A:  Generally, yes, taking it with food can help reduce stomach upset. However, check the specific instructions on your prescription label.
* **Q: How long should I take this medication?** A:  Complete the full course of treatment prescribed by your doctor, even if you start to feel better.  Stopping early may lead to recurrent infection and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat, and keep out of reach of children.
