# Calcium Orotate
### Generic Name
Calcium Orotate

### Usage

Calcium orotate is a calcium supplement used primarily to prevent or treat low blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia) in individuals whose dietary calcium intake is insufficient.  This is important because calcium plays a vital role in numerous bodily functions, including bone health, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.  Calcium orotate may be used to address conditions resulting from calcium deficiency such as:

*   **Osteoporosis:** A condition characterized by weakened bones, increasing the risk of fractures.
*   **Osteomalacia/Rickets:**  Softening of the bones in adults (osteomalacia) or children (rickets), often due to vitamin D deficiency or inadequate calcium absorption.
*   **Hypoparathyroidism:** A disorder where the parathyroid glands don't produce enough parathyroid hormone, crucial for regulating calcium levels.
*   **Certain muscle diseases (latent tetany):**  Muscle spasms or cramps related to low calcium.

Secondary uses may include supporting adequate calcium levels during:

*   **Hip joint plastic surgery:** To ensure sufficient calcium for healing and recovery.
*   **Pregnancy and lactation:**  Increased calcium needs during these periods.
*   **Premenstrual syndrome (PMS):**  Some individuals report PMS symptom relief with supplemental calcium.
*   **Drug-induced osteoporosis:** Osteoporosis caused by medications like phenytoin, phenobarbital, or prednisone.


### Dosage

Dosage varies based on age, overall health, and the specific reason for supplementation. It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's recommendations, as the appropriate dose is highly individualized.  The following are general guidelines, and *always consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting any new supplement*.

**Adults:**  The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for calcium varies with age and sex.  Generally, oral doses range from 400mg to 1480mg elemental calcium daily. This might involve taking one to three tablets, depending on the strength of each tablet (e.g., 400mg or 740mg).  Specific tablet dosages are often determined based on individual needs.

**Children:**  The RDA for calcium in children varies considerably with age, ranging from 200mg to 1300mg daily. Pediatric dosages should always be determined by a pediatrician based on the child's age, weight, and health status.  Liquid or chewable forms are often preferred for children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are not always explicitly stated for renal or hepatic impairment in product labeling. Consult your doctor before using this supplement if you have kidney or liver disease.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

*   Constipation
*   Bloating or abdominal discomfort
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Headache
*   Increased thirst or urination

Less common, but more serious side effects, requiring immediate medical attention, may include:

*   Severe abdominal pain
*   Kidney stones
*   Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium)


If any adverse effects occur, contact a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Calcium orotate provides elemental calcium in a form readily absorbed by the body. Orotic acid, a naturally occurring compound, acts as a chelating agent, improving the absorption of calcium. This increased absorption helps to raise blood calcium levels and replenish calcium stores in the bones and other tissues, addressing calcium deficiency and its associated conditions.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Calcium orotate is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to calcium orotate or any of its components.  It should be avoided in individuals with certain conditions such as sarcoidosis, hyperparathyroidism (overactive parathyroid glands), hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), hypercalciuria (high calcium in urine), or severe dehydration.


* **Interactions:** Calcium can interact with various medications, including:
    * Bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate)
    * Quinolone and tetracycline antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, doxycycline, minocycline)
    * Levothyroxine
    * Phenytoin
    * Tiludronate disodium
    * Thiazide diuretics
    * Aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids
    * Mineral oil and stimulant laxatives
    * Glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone)
    * Oral contraceptives
    * NSAIDs, aspirin, and ibuprofen.

Taking calcium orotate concurrently with these medications may alter their absorption or effectiveness.  Consult a healthcare professional to assess any potential drug interactions.


* **Warnings:** Use caution in individuals with kidney disease, kidney stones, achlorhydria (lack of stomach acid), heart disease, pancreatic disease, or malabsorption syndrome. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctors before using calcium orotate to determine the appropriate dosage.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store calcium orotate?** A: Store calcium orotate as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I take calcium orotate with other supplements?** A:  Consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Calcium can interact with certain other minerals and vitamins.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.

* **Q:  Is calcium orotate safe for long-term use?** A:  The long-term safety of calcium orotate is generally considered safe when taken at recommended doses. However, regular monitoring of blood calcium levels is recommended during long-term use.  Discuss long-term use with your doctor.

* **Q:  What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any severe or persistent side effects.
