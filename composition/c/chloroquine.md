# Chloroquine

**Generic Name:** Chloroquine

**Usage:**

Chloroquine is primarily used to prevent and treat malaria caused by *Plasmodium vivax*, *P. ovale*, *P. malariae*, and sensitive strains of *P. falciparum*.  Note that chloroquine resistance is a significant issue in many parts of the world, and its efficacy against *P. falciparum* is greatly diminished in those areas.  It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine if chloroquine is appropriate for malaria prevention or treatment based on your travel destination and other factors.  

Beyond malaria, chloroquine has also been used, albeit less commonly and often off-label, in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as certain parasitic infections (amebiasis) and some types of porphyria.  **However, its use in these conditions is not standard practice and should only be considered under strict medical supervision.**  Its use against COVID-19 has been largely discredited and is not recommended.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects can range from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Blurred vision**
* **Skin reactions:** Itching, rash
* **Changes in vision:**  Irreversible retinopathy (damage to the retina) is a rare but serious side effect associated with long-term use in high doses.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Cardiac arrhythmias**
* **Seizures**
* **Severe skin reactions**
* **Blood disorders**
* **Hearing loss**
* **Neuropsychiatric effects:** Confusion, hallucinations, psychosis


**How it Works:**

Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that works by accumulating within the acidic food vacuoles of the parasite (Plasmodium). This interferes with the parasite's ability to utilize heme, a toxic byproduct of hemoglobin digestion.  The accumulation of heme is toxic to the parasite, leading to its death.  The exact mechanism of action in other conditions where it's used (off-label) is less clearly understood.


**FAQs:**

* **Is chloroquine safe?** Chloroquine can be safe when used correctly under medical supervision, but it can have significant side effects, some of which can be serious or even irreversible.  The risk-benefit ratio must be carefully considered.
* **Can I use chloroquine to prevent malaria?** Only if prescribed by a doctor and based on your travel destination and risk factors.  Chloroquine resistance is widespread in many regions, rendering it ineffective.
* **Can I use chloroquine to treat COVID-19?** No.  Studies have shown chloroquine is ineffective against COVID-19 and it may even have harmful side effects.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately.
* **How is chloroquine administered?** It can be taken orally as a tablet or liquid. The dosage and duration of treatment will depend on the condition being treated and the individual's health status.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.
