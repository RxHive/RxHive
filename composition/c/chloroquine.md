# Chloroquine
### Generic Name
Chloroquine

### Usage
Chloroquine is primarily used to treat malaria caused by chloroquine-sensitive strains of *Plasmodium* parasites (excluding chloroquine-resistant *Plasmodium falciparum*).  It's crucial to note that the effectiveness of chloroquine varies geographically due to the development of drug resistance in certain regions.  Chloroquine is also used to treat extraintestinal amebiasis, a form of amoebic infection that affects organs outside the intestines, such as the liver.  It's important to understand that the use of chloroquine for COVID-19 is not recommended outside of a hospital setting or a clinical trial due to the risk of heart rhythm problems.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Malaria (uncomplicated):**  A loading dose of 1g (600mg base) on day 1, followed by 500mg (300mg base) at 6, 24, and 48 hours. For chloroquine-sensitive *Plasmodium vivax* and *Plasmodium ovale*, concurrent treatment with primaquine is necessary.
* **Malaria (chemoprophylaxis):** 500mg (300mg base) weekly, starting 1-2 weeks before exposure and continuing for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area.
* **Extraintestinal amebiasis:** 1g (600mg base) daily for 2 days, followed by 500mg daily for 2-3 weeks.  Often used in conjunction with an intestinal amebicide.
* **Lupus erythematosus (off-label):**  Not a first-line treatment. Dosage is carefully determined based on body weight (to avoid retinal toxicity), typically not exceeding 2.3 mg/kg/day.


**Children:** Dosage is calculated based on weight in mg/kg.  Specific regimens for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of malaria and extraintestinal amebiasis exist and should be determined by a healthcare professional.  Always follow the prescribed dosage carefully.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Adjustments are necessary for renal impairment (reduced dosage for GFR < 10 mL/min).  For hepatic impairment, no specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling; however, caution is advised.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal cramps
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Changes in heart rhythm (QT prolongation)
* Retinal toxicity (irreversible in some cases)
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Neurological effects (seizures, psychosis)
* Blood disorders (anemia, thrombocytopenia)
* Liver damage

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.


### How it Works

Chloroquine works by interfering with the parasite's ability to utilize hemoglobin and metabolize heme, a byproduct of hemoglobin breakdown. It concentrates within the acidic food vacuoles of the malaria parasite, raising the internal pH and ultimately inhibiting the parasite's growth and reproduction.  In amebiasis, the mechanism of action is less well understood but is also thought to involve disruption of parasite metabolism and growth.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to chloroquine or related compounds, pre-existing retinal or visual field changes (except in acute malaria).  Use caution with individuals with cardiac disease, arrhythmias, or those taking QT-prolonging medications.
* **Drug Interactions:** Chloroquine can interact with numerous medications, including some antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, and antibiotics.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Chloroquine is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy for treating uncomplicated malaria in chloroquine-sensitive regions.  It's excreted in breast milk, but the risk to the infant is generally considered acceptable at therapeutic doses.  Consult a healthcare provider before using during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **G6PD Deficiency:**  Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are at increased risk of hemolytic anemia.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney disease.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Eye Exams:** Regular eye exams are recommended, especially with long-term use.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store chloroquine?**  A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking chloroquine?**  A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking chloroquine, as it can exacerbate some side effects, particularly gastrointestinal ones.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q:  Is chloroquine effective against all types of malaria?** A: No, it is not effective against chloroquine-resistant *Plasmodium falciparum* or in areas where resistance is widespread.
* **Q: Can chloroquine be used to prevent malaria?** A: Yes, but only in areas where chloroquine-resistant malaria is not prevalent.  Consult your doctor.
