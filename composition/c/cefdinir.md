# Cefdinir

**Generic Name:** Cefdinir

**Usage:** Cefdinir is an antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Ear infections (otitis media):**  Commonly prescribed for middle ear infections in children and adults.
* **Sinus infections (sinusitis):** Treats bacterial infections of the sinuses.

* **Pneumonia (certain types):**  Can be used to treat some forms of bacterial pneumonia.
* **Skin infections:** Effective against various bacterial skin infections.


**Side Effects:** Like all antibiotics, cefdinir can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea:** This can range from mild to severe.  In severe cases, it may indicate *Clostridium difficile* infection (C. diff).
* **Nausea and vomiting:** These gastrointestinal side effects are relatively common.
* **Abdominal pain:**  Stomach discomfort is a possible side effect.
* **Headache:**  A common side effect.
* **Vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis):** Antibiotics can disrupt the balance of good bacteria in the body, leading to yeast overgrowth.
* **Rash:**  Allergic reactions can manifest as skin rashes.
* **Dizziness:** Less common, but possible.

**Severe, but less common side effects require immediate medical attention:**

* **Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis):** Symptoms can include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, and hives.
* **Seizures:**  Rare, but possible, particularly in individuals with pre-existing seizure disorders or kidney problems.
* **Symptoms of *Clostridium difficile* infection (C. diff):** Severe diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain.


**How it Works:** Cefdinir is a cephalosporin antibiotic.  It works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to build and maintain their cell walls. This disruption leads to the death of the bacteria, ultimately clearing the infection.
