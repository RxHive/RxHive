# Choline Theophyllinate
### Generic Name
Choline Theophyllinate

### Usage
Choline theophyllinate is primarily used to treat reversible airway obstruction, a condition where the airways in the lungs narrow and make breathing difficult.  This includes conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's a bronchodilator, meaning it helps relax and open the airways, making it easier to breathe.

### Dosage

**Adults (Reversible Airway Obstruction):**

* **Oral:** The starting dose is typically 100-200 mg per day, adjusted based on individual response.  The maintenance dose is usually 800 mg per day, divided into 3-4 doses.  This needs to be carefully monitored and adjusted by a doctor.

**Children (Reversible Airway Obstruction, >1 year old, <45 kg):**

* **Oral:**  10-20 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, divided into 3-4 doses.  A doctor will determine the precise dosage based on the child's weight and condition.

**Important Considerations:**  The provided dosage information is a general guideline.  Dosage adjustments are not specified in manufacturer labeling for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, and a healthcare professional should always determine the appropriate dose based on individual patient needs and health status.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:** The most common side effects are generally mild and can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Restlessness
* Anxiety
* Insomnia
* Abdominal pain


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  While less frequent, some serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Palpitations
* Tremors
* Seizures (convulsions)
* Severe changes in blood pressure
* Dehydration
* Metabolic acidosis (excessive acid in the blood)
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Agitation

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact a doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Choline theophyllinate is a salt of theophylline.  Once in the body, it releases theophylline, which acts as a bronchodilator.  Theophylline works by blocking the action of phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).  Increased cAMP levels within the cells of the airways lead to relaxation of airway muscles, resulting in bronchodilation and improved breathing.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Choline theophyllinate is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to theophylline or any component of the formulation.

* **Use with Caution:** Use with caution in patients with peptic ulcers, gastritis, hypothyroidism, or severe cardiac, renal, or hepatic impairment.

* **Drug Interactions:** Choline theophyllinate can interact with many medications, including xanthines (additive effects), allopurinol, some antiarrhythmics, cimetidine, disulfiram, fluvoxamine, interferon-alpha, macrolide antibiotics, quinolones, oral contraceptives, tiabendazole, viloxazine, anticonvulsants, ritonavir, rifampicin, sulfinpyrazone, halothane, ketamine, and beta-blockers.  Concomitant use should be carefully considered and discussed with a doctor.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Choline theophyllinate is categorized as pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are not fully understood.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is not recommended during use.

* **Other Precautions:** Administering the medication with food or milk can help minimize gastrointestinal upset.  Large amounts of caffeine should be avoided. Patients should be encouraged to increase fluid intake.  Smoking and consuming charcoal-broiled foods may decrease the drug's effectiveness.
