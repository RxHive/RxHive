# Candesartan + Hydrochlorothiazide

**Generic Name:** Candesartan cilexetil/Hydrochlorothiazide

**Usage:**

Candesartan cilexetil/Hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It's a combination drug, meaning it contains two active ingredients working together:

* **Candesartan cilexetil:** An angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).  It relaxes blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood.
* **Hydrochlorothiazide:** A thiazide diuretic (water pill). It helps your body get rid of excess salt and water, which lowers blood pressure.

This combination is often prescribed when one medication alone isn't enough to control blood pressure effectively.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Muscle cramps
* Dry cough (less common than with ACE inhibitors)
* Changes in potassium levels (hypokalemia or hyperkalemia)


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema â€“ seek immediate medical attention)
* Allergic reactions
* High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Kidney problems
* Liver problems


**How it Works:**

Candesartan cilexetil blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, candesartan allows blood vessels to relax and widen, lowering blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the kidneys, reducing blood volume and thus blood pressure.  The combined effect of these two medications provides a more potent and often more effective blood pressure reduction than either drug alone.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some interactions can occur, particularly with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't take two doses at once.
* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema), difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe dizziness.
* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No, you should never stop taking this medication suddenly.  Stopping abruptly can cause a sudden rise in blood pressure. Your doctor will gradually reduce your dosage if you need to discontinue the medication.
* **Q:  Will this medication cure my high blood pressure?** A: No, this medication controls high blood pressure but doesn't cure it.  You'll likely need to take it long-term to manage your condition.  Lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise, and stress reduction are also important.
* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Excessive alcohol consumption can lower blood pressure and increase the risk of side effects.  Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.
