# Candesartan + Hydrochlorothiazide
### Generic Name
Candesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide

### Usage

Candesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide is a combination medication used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It combines two active ingredients: candesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic.  By working together, these components lower blood pressure more effectively than either drug alone.  The primary goal is to reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular events like stroke and heart attack in patients with hypertension.  While not its primary indication, this combination may also be used in some cases to treat patients with heart failure whose blood pressure needs to be managed.  It's crucial to understand that this medication treats the *symptoms* of high blood pressure and doesn't cure the underlying cause.  A doctor will determine the appropriate use based on individual health needs and risk factors.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on individual patient needs and the doctor's assessment.  It's extremely important to follow your doctor's prescription exactly.  There is no standardized dosage for children.  This medication is generally not recommended for children.

**Oral Administration (Tablet):**

* **Adults:**  The typical starting dose is one tablet daily.  Your doctor may adjust the dose depending on your blood pressure response.  The maximum daily dose is usually one tablet, but this can vary.

**Intravenous Administration (IV):**

Candesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide is not available in an intravenous (IV) formulation.  It is administered orally only.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults may require a lower starting dose due to potential decreased kidney function.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with kidney problems, as the kidneys play a role in eliminating these medications from the body.
* **Liver Disease:**  Patients with liver disease may also require dose adjustments.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 1% of patients) may include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Upper respiratory infections
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Muscle cramps


Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) â€“ this is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.
* High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Dehydration
* Allergic reactions


If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Candesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide works through a dual mechanism:

* **Candesartan (ARB):**  Blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels.  By blocking angiotensin II, candesartan helps relax and widen blood vessels, reducing blood pressure.
* **Hydrochlorothiazide (Thiazide Diuretic):** Increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the urine.  This reduces blood volume, which in turn lowers blood pressure.


The combined effect of these two mechanisms leads to a more significant and sustained reduction in blood pressure compared to using either drug alone.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:**  This medication should not be used during pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimesters, as it can cause serious harm to the developing fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor regarding breastfeeding while taking this medication.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Careful monitoring of kidney function is required, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Liver Disease:**  This medication should be used cautiously in patients with liver disease.
* **Diabetes:**  This medication may affect blood sugar levels.  Diabetic patients should monitor their blood glucose regularly.
* **Drug Interactions:** This medication may interact with several other drugs, including potassium supplements, NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and lithium.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  If you have a known allergy to sulfonamides, you may be allergic to hydrochlorothiazide.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication abruptly?** A: No, stopping this medication abruptly can cause a sudden increase in blood pressure.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Excessive alcohol consumption can lower blood pressure and may interact with this medication.  Moderate alcohol intake should be discussed with your physician.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the medication in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep it out of the reach of children.
* **Q: What if I experience severe side effects?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe side effects, such as swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, or difficulty breathing.
