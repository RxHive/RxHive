# Cefixime + Saccharomyces boulardii + Lactobacillus
### Generic Name: Cefixime + *Saccharomyces boulardii* + *Lactobacillus* (Combination Therapy)


Note:  This combination is not a single, FDA-approved generic medication. It represents a combination of three distinct agents often used together, though not always in a single pre-mixed formulation.  The information below reflects the properties of each component and their potential synergistic effects when used concurrently.  Always follow your doctor's prescription and instructions.  This information should not be considered medical advice.


### Usage

This combination therapy is typically used to treat bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly those accompanied by gut dysbiosis (imbalance of gut flora).  

* **Cefixime:** A third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, cefixime effectively targets a broad range of gram-negative bacteria responsible for many gastrointestinal infections (like *Salmonella*, *Shigella*, *E. coli*).

* **Saccharomyces boulardii:** A non-pathogenic yeast, *S. boulardii* acts as a probiotic. It helps restore the balance of the gut microbiota, competing with harmful bacteria and potentially reducing inflammation.

* **Lactobacillus:**  A genus of lactic acid bacteria, *Lactobacillus* strains (specific species will vary depending on the prescription) are probiotics known to improve gut health. They produce lactic acid, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and produce beneficial compounds that strengthen the gut lining.


The combined effect aims to eradicate the bacterial infection (Cefixime) while simultaneously promoting gut healing and preventing recurrence through probiotic supplementation (*S. boulardii* and *Lactobacillus*).  This approach is often preferred to antibiotic-only treatment, minimizing potential complications from gut dysbiosis induced by antibiotics.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific strains of *Lactobacillus* and *S. boulardii* used, the severity of the infection, the patient's age, weight, and overall health.  There is no standardized, single dosage for this combination.  

**Cefixime:** Dosage is determined by the physician based on the infection and patient factors. It may be administered orally (tablets, capsules) or intravenously (IV) depending on the severity.

**Saccharomyces boulardii & Lactobacillus:** Dosages are usually specified on the probiotic product packaging.  These are typically taken orally as capsules or powders, usually multiple times daily.  

**It is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for precise dosage instructions tailored to your specific situation.**  Never attempt to self-prescribe or adjust dosages without medical guidance.


### Side Effects

**Cefixime:**

* Common: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
* Less Common but Serious: Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), pseudomembranous colitis (severe inflammation of the colon).

**Saccharomyces boulardii & Lactobacillus:**

* Generally well-tolerated.  However, some individuals may experience mild gastrointestinal discomfort like bloating or gas, especially when starting probiotic use.  Rare allergic reactions are possible.

**Important:** If you experience any concerning side effects, discontinue use and contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

* **Cefixime:** Interferes with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, leading to bacterial death and resolution of the infection.

* **Saccharomyces boulardii & Lactobacillus:** These probiotics act in several ways: they compete with pathogenic bacteria for resources and space in the gut; they produce substances that inhibit bacterial growth; and they help strengthen the gut lining, preventing the entry of harmful substances into the bloodstream.  They also help restore the normal gut microbiota, which is essential for healthy digestion and immunity.


### Precautions

* **Cefixime:** Individuals with known allergies to cephalosporin antibiotics should avoid cefixime.  It may interact with certain medications, such as anticoagulants.  Caution is advised in pregnant and breastfeeding women and individuals with kidney disease.

* **Saccharomyces boulardii & Lactobacillus:** Generally safe, but individuals with weakened immune systems or central venous catheters should consult their doctor before using these probiotics.  Interactions with other medications are rare.

* **Combination Therapy:**  It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and allergies before starting this combination therapy.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this combination without a doctor's prescription?**  A: No, this combination requires medical supervision to ensure appropriate dosages and to monitor for any adverse reactions.

* **Q: How long should I take this combination?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the severity of the infection and the patient's response.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.

* **Q:  What if I miss a dose?** A:  Follow your doctor's instructions regarding missed doses.  For Cefixime, it's generally recommended to take the missed dose as soon as possible unless it is almost time for the next dose. For probiotics, missing a dose is usually less critical, but consistency is best.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Follow storage instructions provided with each medication component.  Generally, Cefixime should be stored in a cool, dry place away from moisture and sunlight. Probiotics are often stored in the refrigerator.

* **Q: Are there any interactions with alcohol?** A:  Alcohol consumption may interact negatively with Cefixime.  Check with your doctor for specific advice.  Alcohol may also affect the effectiveness of the probiotics.
