# Crofelemer
### Generic Name
Crofelemer

### Usage
Crofelemer is primarily used to treat noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS who are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).  It's crucial to understand that it only addresses the *symptoms* of diarrhea; it doesn't treat the underlying cause.  Therefore, before starting crofelemer, it's essential to rule out any infectious causes of the diarrhea through appropriate testing.  Crofelemer is not suitable for treating diarrhea caused by infections.

### Dosage
**Adults (HIV/AIDS patients on ART with noninfectious diarrhea):** The usual dose is 125 mg twice daily (BID), taken orally.  The medication should be swallowed whole; do not crush or chew.  It can be taken with or without food.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of crofelemer in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance in these cases.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

*   Nervous system: Anxiety, depression, dizziness
*   Gastrointestinal: Flatulence, nausea, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, constipation, dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, xerostomia (dry mouth)
*   Dermatologic: Acne vulgaris, dermatitis
*   Genitourinary: Urinary tract infection, pollakiuria (frequent urination)
*   Hematologic: Decreased white blood cell count
*   Hepatic: Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, bilirubin)
*   Respiratory: Upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, cough, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis
*   Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, musculoskeletal pain, limb pain
*   Other: Giardiasis (parasite infection), hemorrhoids, nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), herpes zoster (shingles).

Less common, but potentially serious side effects may also occur.  It is vital to report any concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Crofelemer works by affecting the chloride ion channels in the cells lining the intestines.  Specifically, it inhibits both cAMP-stimulated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channels and calcium-activated chloride channels. This action helps regulate fluid secretion in the intestines, reducing the amount of water lost in stool and thereby alleviating diarrhea.  Essentially, it helps normalize the flow of chloride ions and water in the intestinal lining.

### Precautions
* **Infectious Diarrhea:** Crofelemer is not appropriate for treating diarrhea caused by infections.  Infectious causes of diarrhea must be ruled out before starting this medication.  Using it for infectious diarrhea may delay or prevent proper treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Crofelemer is categorized as pregnancy category C.  The effects on a developing fetus are unknown.  The excretion of crofelemer in breast milk is also unknown, but systemic absorption after oral administration is limited.  However, women with HIV should not breastfeed due to the risk of HIV transmission. Consult a healthcare provider for advice on breastfeeding if you are taking crofelemer.
* **Other Medications:**  While no specific drug interactions are listed, it's always crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to prevent potential interactions.
* **Liver and Kidney Function:**  While no specific dosage adjustments are recommended, patients with impaired liver or kidney function should be closely monitored for any adverse effects.
