# Clorazepate
### Generic Name
Clorazepate

### Usage

Clorazepate is a benzodiazepine primarily used to treat anxiety disorders.  It provides short-term relief from anxiety symptoms and is also used to manage acute alcohol withdrawal.  In addition, it serves as an adjunctive therapy in controlling focal (partial-onset) seizures, meaning it works alongside other anti-seizure medications to improve seizure control.  It's important to note that clorazepate is generally used for short-term treatment of anxiety, and long-term use should only be considered in specific cases where other treatments have proven ineffective.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and their response to the medication.  A doctor will carefully determine the appropriate dosage.

**Adults:**

* **Anxiety disorders:**  Initial doses range from 7.5mg to 15mg, taken twice or three times daily, or a single dose at bedtime. The dose may be gradually increased, under medical supervision, up to a maximum of 60mg per day, divided into multiple doses.  Elderly patients often start with lower doses (7.5-15mg/day).

* **Acute alcohol withdrawal:**  Dosage is typically higher initially, starting at 30mg, and adjusted according to the severity of withdrawal symptoms under close medical supervision, generally reducing gradually over several days.

* **Focal seizures (adjunctive therapy):** Initial doses are lower, often starting at 7.5mg three times daily, gradually increasing as needed up to a maximum of 90mg per day.


**Children:** Clorazepate is generally not recommended for children under 9 years old. For children aged 9-12 and adolescents, the dosage is determined by the doctor based on weight and clinical response, always staying within carefully defined limits to ensure safety.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Caution is advised in these populations, and careful monitoring is essential.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Blurred vision
* Dry mouth
* Ataxia (lack of coordination)
* Confusion
* Depression
* Irritability
* Memory impairment


Less common but more serious side effects can include paradoxical reactions (opposite effects, such as increased anxiety or aggression), jaundice, and changes in liver function.  Always consult a healthcare professional if you experience any adverse effects.

### How it Works

Clorazepate belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines. It works by enhancing the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that has a calming effect on the brain and nervous system. By increasing GABA's activity, clorazepate reduces neuronal excitability, leading to a decrease in anxiety, muscle relaxation, and control of seizures.  This happens by increasing the permeability of neuronal membranes to chloride ions.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Clorazepate should not be used by individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, or myasthenia gravis.

* **Drug Interactions:** Clorazepate can interact with many other medications, particularly other CNS depressants (such as alcohol, opioids, and other sedatives). This can lead to increased drowsiness, respiratory depression, and other serious effects.  It is vital to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of clorazepate during pregnancy is not fully established.  Because its active metabolite passes into breast milk, breastfeeding is generally not recommended while using clorazepate.


* **Elderly and Debilitated Patients:**  These individuals should start with lower doses due to increased sensitivity to clorazepate's effects and a higher risk of side effects.

* **Addiction Potential:** Clorazepate, like other benzodiazepines, has an addiction potential.  Long-term use should be carefully monitored by a healthcare professional, and abrupt discontinuation should be avoided due to the risk of severe withdrawal symptoms. Gradual tapering under medical supervision is necessary.


* **Suicidal Ideation:**  Clorazepate can worsen depression and suicidal ideation in vulnerable individuals; careful monitoring is essential.



### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for clorazepate to work?** A: The onset of effects varies, but many individuals experience relief from anxiety symptoms within a few hours of taking the medication.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking clorazepate?** A: No. Combining clorazepate with alcohol significantly increases the risk of severe CNS depression, including respiratory depression.

* **Q: Can I stop taking clorazepate suddenly?** A: No. Abruptly stopping clorazepate can cause withdrawal symptoms, some of which can be dangerous.  Always consult your doctor before stopping the medication; they will guide you on how to gradually reduce the dose.

* **Q: How should I store clorazepate?** A: Store clorazepate at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, and keep it out of the reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's close to the time of your next dose.  Do not take a double dose.
