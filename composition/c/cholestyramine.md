# Cholestyramine

**Generic Name:** Cholestyramine

**Usage:**

Cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant used primarily to lower cholesterol levels in the blood.  It's specifically prescribed for:

* **Type II hyperlipoproteinemia (high cholesterol):**  When diet and exercise aren't enough to control high LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels.
* **Type III hyperlipoproteinemia (high cholesterol):** A less common type of high cholesterol.
* **Pruritus (itching) associated with cholestasis (bile blockage):** It helps relieve itching caused by the buildup of bile salts in the body.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Constipation:** This is a very frequent side effect.
* **Bloating:** Feeling full or swollen.
* **Abdominal pain or cramps:**  Discomfort in the stomach area.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Vomiting:** Throwing up.
* **Heartburn:** A burning sensation in the chest.


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins:**  Can lead to deficiencies in vitamins A, D, E, and K.
* **Gallstones:** Increased risk.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Especially potassium deficiency.
* **Increased bleeding time:**  In individuals taking anticoagulants.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, they can include skin rashes, itching, and swelling.


**How it Works:**

Cholestyramine works by binding to bile acids in the intestines.  Bile acids are substances produced by the liver to help digest fats.  By binding to these acids, cholestyramine prevents their reabsorption into the bloodstream. This triggers the liver to use cholesterol to produce more bile acids, effectively lowering the level of cholesterol in the blood.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take cholestyramine with other medications?** A:  Cholestyramine can interact with many medications, reducing their absorption.  It's crucial to discuss all medications and supplements you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist before starting cholestyramine.  Significant time separation between taking cholestyramine and other medications may be necessary.
* **Q:  How do I manage constipation caused by cholestyramine?** A: Drink plenty of fluids, eat a high-fiber diet, and consider using a stool softener or laxative as recommended by your doctor.
* **Q:  What are the long-term risks of cholestyramine?** A: Long-term use can lead to nutrient deficiencies (fat-soluble vitamins) and potential electrolyte imbalances. Regular monitoring by your doctor is important.
* **Q:  Can I take cholestyramine if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  Discuss this with your doctor.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is usually avoided unless the benefits outweigh the risks.
* **Q:  How is cholestyramine administered?** A: It's usually taken as a powder mixed with water or other liquids.  The powder should not be swallowed dry.
