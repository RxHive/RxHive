# Cholestyramine
### Generic Name
Cholestyramine (also known as Colestyramine)

### Usage
Cholestyramine is primarily used as an adjunct therapy in managing primary hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol).  It helps lower LDL cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol) levels by binding to bile acids in the intestines, preventing their reabsorption into the body.  This process forces the liver to use more cholesterol to produce new bile acids, effectively reducing the cholesterol level in the blood.  

Beyond hypercholesterolemia, cholestyramine is also used to treat pruritus (itching) associated with partial biliary obstruction. In this context, it works by reducing the amount of bile acids that reach the skin, thus alleviating the itching sensation.  It's important to note that cholestyramine is sometimes used off-label for conditions like chronic diarrhea due to bile acid malabsorption, to enhance the elimination of certain medications (like leflunomide), and as adjunctive therapy in Graves' disease (hyperthyroidism).  However, these uses are not officially approved by regulatory bodies and should only be considered under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  Dosages are expressed in terms of anhydrous resin.  The starting dose and maintenance dose vary greatly depending on the specific condition being treated. For dyslipidemia, it typically starts at 4 grams once or twice daily, gradually increasing to 8-16 grams daily, divided into two doses, with a maximum of 24 grams daily. For pruritus associated with cholestasis, the initial dose is also usually 4 grams once or twice daily, potentially increasing up to 16 grams daily in divided doses. Off-label uses have significantly different dosing regimens (see below).  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.

**Children:**  Pediatric dosage is complex and highly dependent on age, weight, and the specific condition being treated.  Dosage can be age-directed or weight-directed, starting lower and gradually increasing as tolerated. For hyperlipidemia,  a common starting point is 2-4 grams daily, potentially increasing to 8 grams daily, but always under close medical supervision.   For pruritus, dosing is often calculated based on weight (240 mg/kg/day), divided into multiple doses.  Maximum doses vary greatly depending on the indication and the child's age and tolerability.

**Forms and Administration:** Cholestyramine is usually administered orally as a powder that is mixed with water or other liquids to create a suspension. It's crucial to mix the powder thoroughly and drink immediately.  It should not be sipped or held in the mouth for an extended time to avoid dental problems. For children, the taste may be masked with juice or other palatable liquids.  Never take cholestyramine in dry form.


**Off-Label Dosages (Examples):**
* **Enhanced Leflunomide Elimination:** 4 grams every 6 hours for 2 weeks, or 8 grams three times daily for 11 days.
* **Hyperthyroidism (Graves' Disease):** 4 grams twice or three times daily, in combination with other medications.


**Note:**  These are just examples and should not be interpreted as a recommendation.  Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and response to treatment.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Constipation, nausea, vomiting, bloating, gas, abdominal cramps, heartburn
* **Less Common but Serious:** Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K),  hypoprothrombinemia (low blood clotting factors), gallstones, rectal bleeding,  pancreatitis.

If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant.  It works in the intestines by binding to bile acids, preventing their reabsorption into the bloodstream. Bile acids are crucial for fat digestion, but they also contain cholesterol. By preventing reabsorption, the liver is stimulated to use more cholesterol to produce new bile acids, leading to a reduction in overall cholesterol levels.  In the case of pruritus, the reduced bile acids reaching the skin decrease the itching.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cholestyramine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication or complete biliary obstruction.
* **Drug Interactions:** Cholestyramine can interact with many medications, reducing their absorption.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Many medications should not be taken concurrently with cholestyramine (examples include digoxin, warfarin, thyroid hormones, many antibiotics, and others).
* **Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women:** While cholestyramine is not absorbed systemically, it's generally considered category C in pregnancy, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been definitively established.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** While no dosage adjustment is typically necessary for hepatic impairment, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment as cholestyramine may cause hyperchloremic acidosis.
* **Vitamin Supplementation:**  Long-term, high-dose use may require supplementation of fat-soluble vitamins.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take cholestyramine with other medications?** A: No, cholestyramine significantly interferes with the absorption of many medications.  Always discuss your medications with your doctor to avoid potential interactions.  It's usually recommended to take other medications at least one hour before or four to six hours after taking cholestyramine.

* **Q:  How should I store cholestyramine?** A: Store cholestyramine in a cool, dry place, away from moisture and direct sunlight, as per the instructions on the packaging.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to catch up.

* **Q: Can cholestyramine cause constipation?** A: Yes, constipation is a common side effect.  Increasing fluid and fiber intake can help mitigate this. If constipation is severe, consult your doctor.

* **Q: Is cholestyramine safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use is possible under medical supervision, but regular monitoring of lipid profiles and nutritional status is necessary.  Long-term use may necessitate supplementation of certain vitamins.  Your doctor can assess if this is appropriate for you.
