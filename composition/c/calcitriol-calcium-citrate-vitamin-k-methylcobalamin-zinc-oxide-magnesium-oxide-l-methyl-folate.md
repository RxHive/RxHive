# Calcitriol + Calcium citrate + Vitamin K + Methylcobalamin + Zinc Oxide + Magnesium Oxide + L-Methyl Folate

This combination of ingredients represents a multivitamin and mineral supplement aimed at supporting bone health, nerve function, and overall well-being.  It's crucial to remember that this is not a prescription medication and should not replace medical advice. Always consult a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have pre-existing conditions or are taking other medications.


**Generic Name:**  Calcitriol + Calcium Citrate + Vitamin K (likely K2 or K1 depending on the formulation) + Methylcobalamin + Zinc Oxide + Magnesium Oxide + L-Methylfolate


**Usage:** This supplement is often used to address deficiencies in the listed vitamins and minerals, specifically targeting:

* **Bone health:** Calcium citrate, vitamin K, calcitriol (active form of vitamin D), magnesium, and zinc all play crucial roles in bone health, calcium absorption, and bone density.
* **Nervous system function:** Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) and L-methylfolate (active form of folate/B9) are essential for nerve function and the production of myelin.
* **General health:** Zinc and magnesium are involved in numerous bodily functions, contributing to overall well-being.

**Note:**  The specific usage will depend on the individual's needs and the dosage in the product.  Some may use it to support bone health in the elderly, those with osteoporosis risk factors, or those with deficiencies.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Calcium-related:** Constipation, kidney stones (especially with pre-existing kidney conditions), nausea, vomiting.
* **Vitamin D-related:**  Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels), nausea, vomiting, weakness.
* **Other:**  Allergic reactions (rare), upset stomach, diarrhea.

**Note:**  These are potential side effects and may not occur in all individuals. Severe side effects are rare but possible, particularly with high doses or pre-existing medical conditions.


**How it Works:** Each ingredient contributes specific actions:

* **Calcitriol (Vitamin D3):**  Increases calcium absorption from the gut and promotes bone mineralization.
* **Calcium Citrate:**  Provides calcium, essential for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth.  Citrate helps with absorption.
* **Vitamin K (K1 or K2):**  Essential for activating proteins needed for bone mineralization and blood clotting. K2 is particularly important for bone health.
* **Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):**  Crucial for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis.
* **Zinc Oxide:**  Supports immune function, wound healing, and various enzyme activities.
* **Magnesium Oxide:**  Involved in numerous bodily processes, including muscle function, nerve transmission, and blood sugar control.
* **L-Methylfolate (Folate/B9):**  Essential for DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell formation. The L-methylfolate form is better absorbed and utilized than folic acid.


**FAQs:**

* **Who should take this supplement?** Individuals with diagnosed deficiencies in any of the listed vitamins and minerals, older adults concerned about bone health, or those with specific dietary restrictions that limit intake of these nutrients.  **Always consult a doctor before starting.**
