# Calcium Gluceptate
### Generic Name
Calcium Gluceptate

### Usage
Calcium gluceptate is primarily used to treat or prevent hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels).  This condition can stem from various underlying causes, including inadequate dietary intake, impaired calcium absorption, certain medical conditions (like hypoparathyroidism), or treatments such as kidney dialysis.  While its primary use focuses on correcting calcium deficiencies, calcium gluceptate may also be used in exchange transfusions with citrated blood, particularly in neonates, to counteract the calcium-binding effects of citrate.


### Dosage
Dosage of calcium gluceptate varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (intravenous [IV] or intramuscular [IM]).  All dosages are expressed in terms of elemental calcium. Remember that 1 gram of calcium gluceptate contains approximately 82 mg (4.1 mEq) of elemental calcium.

**Adults:**

* **Hypocalcemia (IV):** 1.1 to 4.4 grams per day. The specific dosage and frequency will be determined by a healthcare professional based on the severity of hypocalcemia and the individual's response to treatment.
* **Hypocalcemia (IM):** 0.5 to 1.1 grams per day, typically administered in 2 to 5 mL of solution (220 mg/mL).

**Children:**

* **Hypocalcemia (IV):** 200 to 500 mg/kg/day, divided into doses administered every 6 hours.  Precise dosage is determined by a healthcare professional based on the child's weight and clinical condition.
* **Hypocalcemia (IM):** 0.5 to 1.1 grams per day, typically administered in 2 to 5 mL of solution (220 mg/mL).
* **Exchange Transfusions (Neonates, IV):** 0.5 mL of calcium gluceptate is administered after every 100 mL of blood exchanged during the procedure.

### Side Effects
Calcium gluceptate is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur.  These may include:

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Headache
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Flatulence (gas)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Hypophosphatemia (low blood phosphate levels)
* Hypomagnesemia (low blood magnesium levels)
* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels â€“ a serious complication with potential long-term consequences, including anorexia, coma, confusion, delirium, lethargy, and milk-alkali syndrome; usually associated with very high or chronic dosing).


If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed above as serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Calcium gluceptate acts as a calcium supplement, replenishing low levels of calcium in the body. Calcium plays a vital role in many bodily functions, including muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and maintaining strong bones.  By increasing blood calcium levels, calcium gluceptate helps alleviate the symptoms and complications associated with hypocalcemia.  Additionally, it has a positive inotropic effect on the heart, meaning it increases the force of the heart's contractions.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Calcium gluceptate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the medication, achlorhydria (lack of stomach acid), ventricular fibrillation, hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), or digitalis toxicity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Calcium gluceptate can interact with numerous medications, including some antibiotics (quinolones, tetracyclines), bisphosphonates, cardiac glycosides, and others.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Patients with kidney problems should use calcium gluceptate with caution due to the potential for calcium accumulation.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While the exact effects of calcium gluceptate during pregnancy and breastfeeding are not fully understood, caution is advised. Consult with your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Other Precautions:** Individuals with sarcoidosis, cor pulmonale, respiratory failure, or respiratory acidosis should also exercise caution when using calcium gluceptate.


### FAQs
* **Q: How should I store calcium gluceptate?** A: Store as directed by your healthcare professional or as indicated on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I take calcium gluceptate with food?** A: This depends on the administration route (IV or IM) and the specific instructions from your healthcare provider.  For oral forms of calcium supplements, taking them with food may improve absorption.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not try to make up for a missed dose by taking two doses at once. Contact your healthcare professional for advice on how to proceed.

* **Q: Is calcium gluceptate safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use should be under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional to monitor blood calcium levels and prevent potential complications like hypercalcemia.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary considerations while taking calcium gluceptate?** A: This is dependent on the underlying reason for using calcium gluceptate; your healthcare professional can advise you on dietary changes and supplements.
