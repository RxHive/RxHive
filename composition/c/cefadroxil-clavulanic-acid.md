# Cefadroxil + Clavulanic Acid
### Generic Name
Cefadroxil + Clavulanic Acid

**Note:**  Cefadroxil and Clavulanic acid are often combined in a single formulation.  It's crucial to understand that this isn't a single drug but a combination of two antibiotics working synergistically.  Cefadroxil is a cephalosporin antibiotic, and clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor.  This combination broadens the spectrum of bacteria the medication can effectively fight.  Always refer to the specific brand name and its accompanying prescribing information for precise details regarding dosage and precautions.  The information below provides a general overview and shouldn't replace consultation with a healthcare professional.

### Usage

Cefadroxil + Clavulanic acid is primarily used to treat bacterial infections in various parts of the body.  The combination is particularly effective against bacteria that produce beta-lactamase, an enzyme that can inactivate many antibiotics, including cefadroxil alone.  Common infections treated include:

* **Respiratory tract infections:**  Such as bronchitis, pneumonia (certain types), and sinusitis, when caused by susceptible bacteria.
* **Skin and skin structure infections:**  Including abscesses, cellulitis, and wound infections.
* **Ear infections (otitis media):**  Especially in cases where the infection is resistant to other antibiotics.
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):**  Caused by susceptible bacteria.

It's important to note that this combination is not effective against all types of bacterial infections, and a doctor should determine if it's the appropriate treatment based on the specific infection and the bacteria causing it.  Viral infections, like the common cold or flu, won't respond to this antibiotic.

### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the specific brand name, the patient's age, weight, kidney function, and the severity of the infection.  Therefore, **it's critical to follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions precisely.**  There is no standard "one-size-fits-all" dosage.  Generally, it's administered orally (tablets or capsules) and less commonly intravenously (IV).  Pediatric dosages are always adjusted based on weight and are determined by a healthcare professional.  

**Never adjust the dose yourself.**  Inappropriate dosage can lead to treatment failure or harmful side effects.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach pain
* Rash
* Itching
* Vaginal yeast infection (in women)


Less common but serious side effects (require immediate medical attention):

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis): Difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, hives.
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD):  Severe, persistent diarrhea.
* Seizures (particularly in patients with pre-existing seizure disorders or kidney problems).
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Cefadroxil works by interfering with the bacteria's ability to build cell walls.  Bacteria need intact cell walls to survive; by disrupting this process, cefadroxil causes the bacterial cells to burst and die.  However, some bacteria produce beta-lactamase, an enzyme that breaks down cephalosporins like cefadroxil.  Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor â€“ it binds to and inactivates beta-lactamase, protecting cefadroxil and allowing it to effectively kill the bacteria. This synergistic action makes the combination more effective against a wider range of bacteria.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Patients with known allergies to penicillin or other cephalosporin antibiotics should inform their doctor before taking this medication.  Severe allergic reactions can occur.
* **Kidney disease:** Dosage adjustments are usually necessary for patients with kidney problems.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  The safety of this medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using it.
* **Interactions:**  Cefadroxil + Clavulanic acid can interact with certain other medications.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are currently taking.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication, as it can increase the risk of side effects.

### FAQs
