# Cefprozil
### Generic Name
Cefprozil

### Usage
Cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic primarily used to treat bacterial infections.  Its main applications include:

* **Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis:** This refers to a worsening of chronic bronchitis symptoms caused by a bacterial infection.
* **Otitis media:** Also known as a middle ear infection, this is a common childhood illness.
* **Uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections:** These are infections affecting the outer layers of the skin and underlying tissues, such as cellulitis or impetigo.  The infection must be uncomplicated, meaning it hasn't spread extensively or involved deeper tissues.
* **Pharyngitis/tonsillitis:** These are infections of the throat and tonsils, often caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes* (strep throat).


While less common, cefprozil may also be used for other bacterial infections based on a doctor's assessment of the specific bacteria involved and their susceptibility to the drug.  **It is crucial to note that cefprozil is not effective against viral infections.**


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The specific dose and duration of treatment will depend on the severity and type of infection, as determined by a physician. General recommendations are:

* **Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections, and acute sinusitis:** 250-500 mg every 12 hours, or 500 mg every 24 hours, for 10 days. Higher doses may be necessary for more severe infections.
* **Pharyngitis/tonsillitis:** 500 mg every 24 hours, for at least 10 days (longer duration is often recommended for strep throat).


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage is calculated based on the child's weight (mg/kg) and the type of infection.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose; however,  common ranges are: 7.5-15 mg/kg every 12 hours for most infections.  The maximum single dose is generally 500 mg.  The specific dosage and duration will vary greatly depending on the child's age, weight, and the infection's nature.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Kidney function plays a crucial role in cefprozil elimination. For individuals with reduced kidney function (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), dosage reduction is often necessary.  Those undergoing dialysis may require adjusted dosing schedules. Liver impairment generally doesn't necessitate dose changes. Always consult with a healthcare professional before adjusting the dosage.



### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Vomiting
* Dizziness
* Diaper rash (in infants)
* Genital pruritus (itching)
* Increased liver enzyme levels


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to life-threatening anaphylaxis)
* Pseudomembranous colitis (a severe intestinal infection)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a rare but serious skin reaction)
* Changes in kidney function
* Blood disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia)

If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact a doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Cefprozil is a beta-lactam antibiotic that works by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  By inhibiting peptidoglycan production, cefprozil prevents the bacteria from building and maintaining their cell walls, leading to cell death and bacterial eradication.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Cefprozil should not be used by individuals with known allergies to cefprozil, other cephalosporin antibiotics, or penicillins (cross-reactivity can occur).
* **Kidney Disease:**  Patients with impaired kidney function require dosage adjustments to prevent accumulation of the drug.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Cefprozil is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning it has not been shown to cause harm in animal studies, but human data is limited. It is excreted in breast milk, so caution is warranted during breastfeeding.
* **Interactions:** Cefprozil may interact with certain medications, including aminoglycosides (increased risk of kidney damage), probenecid (increased cefprozil levels), and vitamin K antagonists (increased bleeding risk).  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Superinfection:**  Like other antibiotics, cefprozil can disrupt the normal balance of gut bacteria, potentially leading to secondary infections (e.g., *Clostridium difficile* colitis).


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Cefprozil with food?** A: Cefprozil can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store Cefprozil?** A: Store Cefprozil as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is Cefprozil safe for children?** A:  Cefprozil can be used in children, but dosage must be carefully calculated by a healthcare provider based on their weight and the infection.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Cefprozil once I feel better?** A: No. It is crucial to complete the entire course of medication, even if you feel better, to prevent recurrence of the infection and the development of antibiotic resistance.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.
