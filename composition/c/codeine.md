# Codeine

**Generic Name:** Codeine

**Usage:** Codeine is an opioid pain medication used to treat mild to moderately severe pain.  It's also sometimes found in cough suppressants to relieve coughs.  However, due to its potential for abuse and dependence, its use in cough suppressants is declining.  Prescription is required.

**Side Effects:**  Codeine can cause a wide range of side effects, varying in severity from person to person.  Common side effects include:

* **Constipation:** This is a very common side effect.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Especially common with higher doses.
* **Drowsiness and dizziness:** Can impair driving and operating machinery.
* **Lightheadedness:** Feeling faint or unsteady.
* **Headache:**
* **Dry mouth:**
* **Itching:**
* **Sweating:**

**More serious, though less common, side effects include:**

* **Slowed breathing (respiratory depression):** This is a life-threatening side effect.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms can range from rash to difficulty breathing.
* **Seizures:**
* **Addiction and dependence:**  Prolonged use can lead to physical and psychological dependence.
* **Withdrawal symptoms:**  Stopping codeine abruptly after prolonged use can cause unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.


**How it Works:** Codeine is an opioid agonist. This means it binds to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, reducing the perception of pain and suppressing the cough reflex.  It's important to note that codeine is metabolized in the liver to morphine, which is a more potent opioid.  The effectiveness of codeine varies significantly between individuals due to genetic differences in how it's metabolized.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I drive after taking codeine?** No, codeine can cause drowsiness and dizziness, impairing your ability to drive safely.  Do not operate machinery or drive until you know how codeine affects you.
