# Codeine
### Generic Name
Codeine

### Usage
Codeine is an opioid pain reliever (analgesic) and cough suppressant.  Its primary use is for moderate to moderately severe pain relief.  It's often used in combination with other medications, such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen, to enhance pain relief.  A secondary, and increasingly less common due to safety concerns, use is as a cough suppressant, though more modern and safer cough medications are generally preferred.  Codeine's effectiveness as a cough suppressant is due to its action on the central nervous system.  It's important to note that codeine's use as a cough suppressant is considered off-label in many instances, meaning it's not the primary FDA-approved indication.

### Dosage
**Dosage must be determined by a healthcare professional and is highly individualized.**  The following information is for general understanding only and should not be interpreted as a prescription or recommendation for self-medication.  Never alter your dosage without consulting your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Adults (Pain):**  Oral dosages typically range from 15-60 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, with a maximum daily dose of 360 mg for those without prior opioid use.  Higher initial doses might be necessary for individuals with prior opioid exposure. Dosage should always be titrated to the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.
* **Adults (Cough):**  Oral dosages typically range from 7.5-30 mg every 4-6 hours as needed.
* **Children:**  Codeine is generally **contraindicated** in children under 12 years old due to the risk of serious side effects, including life-threatening respiratory depression.  Use in children aged 12 and older should only be considered under strict medical supervision and with careful monitoring, and even then, is often avoided due to safer alternatives.  Dosage would be determined by the healthcare provider based on weight and clinical factors.
* **Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not explicitly detailed in manufacturer labeling, however, lower starting doses and longer intervals are recommended, with careful titration to effect, as clearance of the drug and its metabolites may be reduced.

**Forms:** Codeine is available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, and liquid solutions. Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional and on the medication label regarding the correct administration route and dosage form.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Headache
* Dry mouth


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Respiratory depression (slowed or shallow breathing) â€“ This is a serious side effect and requires immediate medical attention.
* Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling)
* Seizures
* Dependence (with prolonged use)
* Withdrawal symptoms (upon cessation of prolonged use)


**If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works
Codeine is an opioid agonist, meaning it binds to opioid receptors in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).  This binding action reduces the perception of pain signals and also suppresses the cough reflex in the brainstem. Codeine is a prodrug, meaning it's converted in the liver into morphine, its active metabolite, which is responsible for much of its analgesic effects. The extent of this conversion varies significantly between individuals due to genetic differences in liver enzyme activity.  This variation contributes to the significant risk of adverse reactions, especially respiratory depression, in some individuals.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Codeine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to codeine or any formulation component, children under 12, and children under 18 following tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy. It's also contraindicated in those with severe respiratory depression, acute or severe bronchial asthma (without appropriate monitoring and rescuscitative equipment), GI obstruction, and in those currently using or having recently used MAOIs.
* **Interactions:** Codeine can interact with other medications, including other CNS depressants (such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other opioids), antidepressants, and certain antihistamines. These interactions can increase the risk of drowsiness, respiratory depression, and other adverse effects.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Codeine is categorized as a Pregnancy Category C drug, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  It can cross the placenta and can cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.  Codeine is also excreted in breast milk and can affect the nursing infant.   It is generally best avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. This decision should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.
* **Older Adults and Individuals with Liver or Kidney Disease:** Older adults and individuals with liver or kidney impairment are at increased risk for adverse effects due to slower metabolism and clearance of the drug. Lower doses and careful monitoring are essential.
* **Potential for Abuse and Dependence:** Codeine is an opioid and carries a risk of abuse and dependence, particularly with prolonged use.  It is crucial to use this medication only as prescribed and to avoid exceeding the recommended dosage.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take for codeine to work?**  A: The onset of pain relief can vary but usually occurs within 30-60 minutes of oral administration.
* **Q: How should I store codeine?** A: Store codeine at room temperature, away from moisture and heat, and keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q: Can I take codeine with other medications?** A:  This requires careful consideration. Always discuss all other medications and supplements you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist before taking codeine.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
* **Q: Can I suddenly stop taking codeine?** A:  No, especially if you have been taking it for a prolonged period.  Abrupt cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  You must taper off codeine under the supervision of your doctor.
* **Q: Is codeine addictive?** A: Yes, codeine is an opioid and carries a risk of physical and psychological dependence, particularly with long-term use.
