# Cetuximab
### Generic Name
Cetuximab

### Usage
Cetuximab is a targeted cancer medication primarily used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).  Its effectiveness in colorectal cancer is largely dependent on the presence or absence of a specific genetic mutation in the KRAS gene; it's typically used in patients whose tumors are KRAS wild-type (meaning they lack this mutation).  For head and neck cancer, it's used in combination with radiation therapy or chemotherapy, or sometimes as a single agent.  Importantly, Cetuximab is also used off-label in several other cancers, including advanced or metastatic squamous cell penile cancer and unresectable squamous cell skin cancer.  These off-label uses should always be discussed with an oncologist.


### Dosage

Cetuximab is administered intravenously (IV). Dosage varies considerably based on the specific cancer being treated and whether it's used alone or in combination with other therapies.

**Colorectal Cancer (mCRC):**

* **Metastatic, KRAS wild-type:**  A loading dose of 400 mg/m² is typically given over 120 minutes, followed by weekly maintenance doses of 250 mg/m² over 60 minutes.  Treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.  When used with other chemotherapies (like FOLFOX, mFOLFOX6, or FOLFIRI), the dosing schedule and timing may differ; always follow the oncologist's instructions.
* **Advanced Disease (off-label):**  Biweekly administration of 500 mg/m² is sometimes used, particularly when combined with irinotecan.

**Head and Neck Cancer (SCCHN):**

* **Standard Dosing:** A loading dose of 400 mg/m² over 120 minutes is followed by weekly maintenance doses of 250 mg/m² over 60 minutes. Treatment is usually given in combination with radiation and/or chemotherapy, and the precise schedule is tailored to the treatment plan.  If used with radiotherapy, the loading dose is typically administered one week before radiation begins.

**Other Cancers (off-label):**  Dosing in other cancers, like advanced or metastatic squamous cell penile cancer and unresectable squamous cell skin cancer, often mirrors the approach used for head and neck or colorectal cancers,  but the specific regimen is determined by the oncologist based on the individual case.

**Important Note:**  All dosages are calculated based on body surface area (m²).  Premedication with an antihistamine (like diphenhydramine) is often recommended before the first dose and possibly subsequent doses to mitigate infusion reactions.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Malaise (general feeling of discomfort)
* Pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Skin rash (acneiform, desquamation)
* Changes in nails
* Infection
* Infusion reactions (fever, chills, etc.)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Cardiopulmonary arrest or sudden death (rare but potentially fatal)
* Severe infusion reactions requiring immediate discontinuation
* Pulmonary toxicity (lung problems)
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Electrolyte imbalances (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia)

If you experience any significant or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).  EGFR is a protein found on the surface of certain cancer cells that promotes their growth and division.  By binding to EGFR, Cetuximab blocks the signals that stimulate cancer cell proliferation.  This leads to a slowdown or cessation of tumor growth and, in some cases, programmed cell death (apoptosis).  It's crucial to note that the effectiveness of Cetuximab depends on the presence or absence of certain genetic mutations (particularly in the KRAS gene) within the cancer cells.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Cetuximab is contraindicated in patients with a known severe allergy to the medication or its components.
* **Infusion Reactions:**  Serious and potentially fatal infusion reactions can occur. Close monitoring during and after infusion is essential.
* **Cardiopulmonary Issues:** Increased risk of cardiopulmonary arrest or sudden death, especially when combined with radiation or certain chemotherapy regimens.  Caution is advised in patients with pre-existing heart or lung conditions.
* **Dermatological Toxicity:**  Skin reactions (acneiform rash, desquamation) are common.  Sun exposure can worsen these reactions.
* **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Monitor serum electrolytes, especially magnesium, potassium, and calcium, regularly.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Cetuximab is a pregnancy category C drug; it may harm a developing fetus.  Effective contraception is essential during treatment and for several months afterward. Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for at least two months after the last dose.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While no major interactions are currently well-documented, it's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does Cetuximab treatment last?**  A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the response to therapy and the presence of side effects.  It's determined on a case-by-case basis by the oncologist.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your oncologist immediately to determine the best course of action. Do not attempt to adjust your dosage yourself.

* **Q: How is Cetuximab stored?**  A: Specific storage instructions vary based on the formulation; consult the medication's packaging or your pharmacist.

* **Q: Are there alternatives to Cetuximab?** A: Yes, several other targeted therapies and chemotherapies are available for the treatment of colorectal and head and neck cancers.  Your oncologist can discuss alternative options based on your individual needs and circumstances.

* **Q: Can Cetuximab cure cancer?** A:  Cetuximab is a treatment, not a cure. It aims to control cancer growth and improve a patient's quality of life and survival.
