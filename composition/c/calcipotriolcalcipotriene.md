# Calcipotriol/Calcipotriene
### Generic Name
Calcipotriol/Calcipotriene

### Usage
Calcipotriol/Calcipotriene is a topical medication primarily used to treat plaque psoriasis in adults.  It's available in various forms (cream, ointment, foam, and solution) to address psoriasis affecting different areas of the body, including the scalp and body.  While its primary use is for plaque psoriasis, it is generally not used for other types of psoriasis or skin conditions.  The specific formulation (cream, ointment, foam, or solution) is chosen based on the location and severity of the psoriasis.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The dosage varies depending on the formulation and the area affected.  Generally, a thin film is applied to the affected area twice daily (BID) for creams and foams, and once or twice daily for ointments.  The solution for scalp psoriasis is also typically applied twice daily.  Precise instructions will be provided by a healthcare professional and on the product label.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of the cream, ointment, and solution haven't been established for children under 12 years of age.  However, the foam formulation is approved for use in children aged 12 and older, typically using the same application method as adults. For younger children (2 years and older), creams and ointments may be used under strict medical supervision, usually in lower dosages or less frequently.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage and monitoring requirements for children.

### How it Works

Calcipotriol is a synthetic form of vitamin D3.  It works by binding to vitamin D receptors in skin cells (keratinocytes). This binding action helps regulate the growth and development of skin cells.  Specifically, it slows down the rapid production of skin cells characteristic of psoriasis, and promotes their normal maturation, reducing the thickening and scaling of the skin associated with the condition.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Calcipotriol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to calcipotriol or any of the formulation's components, those with hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), evidence of vitamin D toxicity, and in acute psoriatic eruptions (for the scalp solution).  Avoid use on the face (with cream and ointment formulations).
* **Interactions:**  While unlikely with topical application, interactions with other medications are possible. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are using.
* **Specific populations:**  Use with caution in elderly patients and children.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits of using calcipotriol with their doctor.  In general, topical agents should be avoided around the nipple area in nursing women.  Limited use during pregnancy may be considered.
* **Safety measures:** Avoid excessive sun exposure, both natural and artificial.  Keep the foam and solution away from open flames.  For the foam and solution, apply only to dry hair.  Wash hands thoroughly after each application.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?**  A:  The improvement in psoriasis symptoms may vary but usually becomes noticeable within a few weeks of regular use. Consistent application is key.

* **Q: Can I use this with other topical treatments?** A: Discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist. Using multiple topical medications simultaneously might increase the risk of irritation or other adverse effects.  If using multiple topical agents, apply them at separate times throughout the day.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the medication as soon as you remember, but if it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule.  Don't double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store calcipotriol?** A:  Store as directed on the product label; usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture, and out of reach of children.

* **Q: Is it safe to use on my face?** A:  No. Cream and ointment formulations should not be applied to the face. Always follow the product instructions.

* **Q: Can I use this medication indefinitely?** A:  No.  Calcipotriene is typically used for a limited period, as determined by your doctor.  Prolonged use may increase the risk of side effects.  Your doctor will advise on the duration of treatment.
