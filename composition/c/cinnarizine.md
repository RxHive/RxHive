# Cinnarizine

**Generic Name:** Cinnarizine

**Usage:**

Cinnarizine is used to treat symptoms of vertigo (dizziness) and motion sickness.  It's also sometimes used to treat disorders related to impaired blood circulation in the brain, such as Meniere's disease and migraine headaches (although its effectiveness for migraines is debated and not always a primary treatment).  Prescribing practices vary by region and physician.

**Side Effects:**

Cinnarizine, like all medications, can cause side effects.  These can include but are not limited to:

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, headache, dry mouth, gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, constipation), weight gain.
* **Less Common:**  Extrapyramidal symptoms (involuntary muscle movements), skin rash, blurred vision.
* **Rare:**  Serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), jaundice.

It's important to note that not everyone experiences side effects, and the severity can vary.  If you experience any concerning side effects, you should contact your doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

Cinnarizine is a calcium channel blocker with antihistamine properties.  It works primarily by blocking calcium channels in the smooth muscle of blood vessels, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). This improved blood flow can help alleviate dizziness and other symptoms related to impaired blood circulation in the inner ear and brain.  Its antihistamine properties may contribute to its effectiveness in reducing vertigo and motion sickness.
