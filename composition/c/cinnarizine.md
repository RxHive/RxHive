# Cinnarizine
### Generic Name
Cinnarizine

### Usage

Cinnarizine is a medication with multiple applications, primarily used to prevent and treat several conditions related to the inner ear and blood vessels.  Its main use is in preventing motion sickness (nausea, vomiting, and dizziness caused by travel). It's also effective in managing various peripheral circulatory disorders, such as intermittent claudication (leg pain due to reduced blood flow), cold extremities, and vasospastic disorders (abnormal narrowing of blood vessels).  Furthermore, cinnarizine finds application in treating vestibular disorders, encompassing symptoms like vertigo (spinning sensation), dizziness, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), and nausea and vomiting often associated with Meniere's disease (an inner ear disorder).  It may also be used as an adjunct therapy for cerebrovascular disorders (problems with blood vessels in the brain) and in the prophylaxis (prevention) of migraines.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on the condition being treated and the patient's age.  Always follow your doctor's prescription.  Here's a general overview:

**Adults:**

* **Motion sickness:**  Dosage ranges from 15-25mg, taken orally 30 minutes to 2 hours before travel, with repeat doses as needed.  The maximum daily dose is generally 225mg. Different formulations (tablets and oral suspensions) exist, and their specific dosing instructions will vary.
* **Peripheral circulatory disorders:**  Typical dosage is 50-75mg, administered orally 2-3 times daily.
* **Vestibular disorders & Meniere's disease:**  A common dosage is 25-30mg, taken orally three times a day.
* **Migraine prophylaxis:** Dosage is usually 25mg three times a day.


**Children:**

Dosage for children is significantly lower and should always be determined by a pediatrician based on age and weight.  It's crucial to note that cinnarizine is generally not recommended for children under 5 years of age. For older children, the dosage for vestibular disorders and motion sickness is adjusted downward compared to adult doses.

**Dosage Forms:** Cinnarizine is available in various forms, including tablets and oral suspensions (liquids).  The specific dosage instructions will differ depending on the form.  Always follow the instructions provided with your medication.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild, but some individuals may experience:

* Drowsiness
* Nausea
* Weight gain

Less common, but potentially more serious side effects, include:

* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Extrapyramidal symptoms (movement disorders)
* Liver problems (cholestatic jaundice)
* Other less frequent side effects are reported but are rare.


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Cinnarizine works through two primary mechanisms:

1. **Calcium Channel Blockade:** It inhibits the influx of calcium ions into smooth muscle cells in blood vessels, leading to relaxation and widening of the blood vessels. This improved blood flow helps alleviate symptoms of peripheral circulatory disorders.

2. **Vestibular System Inhibition:** Cinnarizine also affects the vestibular system (the inner ear's balance mechanism), reducing its excitability and thus decreasing the symptoms of vertigo and other vestibular disorders.  It acts on receptors in the inner ear, reducing the signals that cause dizziness and nausea.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cinnarizine should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to cinnarizine or similar medications (H1 antihistamines), those with porphyria (a group of genetic disorders affecting heme production), or children under 5 years of age.
* **Interactions:** Concomitant use with central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., alcohol, sedatives) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) may increase drowsiness; therefore, it is important to discuss all medications with your doctor before starting treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Cinnarizine is categorized as a pregnancy category C drug, indicating potential risks to the fetus.  Use during pregnancy should be carefully considered.  The excretion of cinnarizine in breast milk is unknown; therefore breastfeeding is generally not recommended while taking this drug.
* **Other Precautions:**  Exercise caution in individuals with hepatic or renal impairment, Parkinson's disease, hypotension (low blood pressure), and the elderly.  Avoid tasks requiring alertness (e.g., driving, operating machinery) due to the potential for drowsiness.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take cinnarizine with alcohol?**  A: No, combining cinnarizine with alcohol may enhance drowsiness and other side effects. Avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.
* **Q: How should I store cinnarizine?** A: Store cinnarizine at room temperature, away from moisture and light, and keep out of the reach of children.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Can I stop taking cinnarizine suddenly?** A: No,  stop taking cinnarizine gradually, as directed by your doctor to avoid potential withdrawal effects.
* **Q: Is cinnarizine habit-forming?**  A: Cinnarizine is not considered habit-forming.
