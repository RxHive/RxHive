# Carbinoxamine
### Generic Name
Carbinoxamine

### Usage
Carbinoxamine is primarily used to treat the symptoms of allergies.  This includes seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (hay fever and year-round allergies affecting the nose), vasomotor rhinitis (non-allergic nasal congestion), allergic conjunctivitis (allergic inflammation of the eyes), and mild allergic skin conditions like urticaria (hives), angioedema (swelling under the skin), and dermatographism (skin reaction to pressure).  It's also used as an adjunct therapy (in addition to other treatments) for anaphylactic reactions, helping to reduce the severity of allergic reactions after the initial, acute symptoms are managed with epinephrine and other emergency measures.  This secondary use also includes reducing the severity of allergic reactions to blood or plasma transfusions.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Oral, immediate-release:** 4-8 mg per dose, 3-4 times daily.
* **Oral, extended-release:** 6-16 mg every 12 hours.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage is highly dependent on the child's age and weight. Always follow the specific instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Generally:

* **Oral, immediate-release (solution or tablet):**
    * Children aged 2-5 years:  A weight-based dose of 0.2-0.4 mg/kg/day, divided into 3-4 doses, or a fixed dose of 1-2 mg per dose, 3-4 times daily (maximum 0.4 mg/kg/day).
    * Children aged 6-11 years: 2-4 mg per dose, 3-4 times daily.
    * Children aged 12 years and older: 4-8 mg per dose, 3-4 times daily.
* **Oral, extended-release suspension:**  Doses vary by age and are generally given every 12 hours.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for precise dosage based on your child's age and weight.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is typically necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include: drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and nausea.

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:  chest tightness, palpitations, rapid heart rate, confusion, seizures, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), and blood disorders.


If you experience any side effects, particularly serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Carbinoxamine is an antihistamine, specifically an H1 receptor antagonist. Histamine is a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, causing many of the symptoms. Carbinoxamine works by blocking histamine from binding to its receptors on cells. This prevents the histamine from triggering the allergic response, reducing symptoms like itching, swelling, and runny nose.  It also possesses anticholinergic properties, meaning it can dry up secretions, which is why dry mouth is a common side effect.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Carbinoxamine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to carbinoxamine or related compounds, children under 2 years old, patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and breastfeeding women.
* **Interactions:**  Carbinoxamine can interact with MAOIs, leading to intensified anticholinergic effects.  It can also have additive effects with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, such as sedatives and alcohol. Avoid combining carbinoxamine with these medications.
* **Warnings:** Use caution in elderly patients, those with cardiovascular disease, asthma, increased intraocular pressure, narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, hyperthyroidism, pyloroduodenal obstruction, bladder neck obstruction, or those performing tasks requiring alertness.  Carbinoxamine may cause drowsiness and impair cognitive function.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Carbinoxamine is classified as Category C during pregnancy, meaning potential risks to the developing fetus cannot be ruled out.  It's not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
