# Calcium Carbonate
### Generic Name
Calcium Carbonate

### Usage

Calcium carbonate serves a dual purpose in medicine.  Its primary use is as a dietary supplement to address calcium deficiency.  This is crucial for maintaining bone health and preventing conditions like osteoporosis (weakening of bones), osteomalacia (softening of bones), and hypocalcemic rickets (bone disease in children due to low calcium).  It's also used to treat hypocalcemia (low blood calcium) itself,  a condition that can lead to muscle cramps, spasms, and other problems.


Secondary uses include its function as an antacid. Calcium carbonate neutralizes stomach acid, providing relief from symptoms of heartburn, acid indigestion, and upset stomach.  It's also used off-label in managing hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate levels in the blood), particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this context, it binds to phosphate in the digestive tract, facilitating its elimination from the body.  Additional off-label uses include aiding in the management of chronic hypocalcemia and hypoparathyroidism (low parathyroid hormone levels).


### Dosage

Dosage for calcium carbonate varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's age and overall health.  It's essential to follow the prescription instructions carefully.  

**Note:**  One gram of calcium carbonate contains approximately 400 mg of elemental calcium.  Dosage recommendations often refer to elemental calcium rather than the total amount of calcium carbonate.

**Adults:**

* **Calcium Supplementation:** 500 mg to 4 g of calcium carbonate per day, divided into 1-3 doses.  Dietary intake of calcium should be maximized before relying heavily on supplements.
* **Hyperacidity:** 0.5-3 g as needed for symptoms, up to a maximum of 7.5 g daily for a maximum of two weeks.
* **Hyperphosphatemia (CKD):** 3-7 g daily, divided into multiple doses, adjusted based on individual serum phosphate levels.
* **Hypoparathyroidism/Chronic Hypocalcemia:** 500 mg to 1 g of elemental calcium two or three times daily;  dosing may need to be more frequent depending on the individual's response.  In acute severe cases, intravenous calcium may be necessary.

**Children:**  Pediatric dosages must be determined by a physician, considering the child's age, weight, and specific condition. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for calcium changes with age and is primarily met through diet.  Supplemental calcium for children is best guided by a pediatrician.


**Forms:** Calcium carbonate is available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, chewable tablets, and powders for suspension. Always follow the directions on the medication label.


**Administration:** Calcium carbonate is typically taken orally with food to enhance absorption.


### Side Effects


Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):

* Headache
* Constipation
* Abdominal pain
* Gas (flatulence)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Laxative effect

Less common but more serious side effects:

* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels)
* Hypophosphatemia (low blood phosphate levels)
* Milk-alkali syndrome (a rare but serious condition involving high calcium and alkali levels).


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Calcium carbonate acts in different ways depending on its application.  As a dietary supplement, it provides the body with calcium to meet daily needs, improving calcium balance.  In treating hyperacidity, it acts as an antacid, neutralizing stomach acid through a chemical reaction.  In the management of hyperphosphatemia, especially in CKD, it binds to dietary phosphate, forming an insoluble compound that's excreted in the feces, effectively lowering phosphate levels in the blood.


### Precautions


* **Contraindications:** Calcium carbonate is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to calcium carbonate or its components.
* **Interactions:**  Concurrent use with thiazide diuretics or vitamin D increases the risk of hypercalcemia and milk-alkali syndrome.  It can also decrease the absorption of tetracyclines, iron, and several other medications.  It may enhance the effects of digitalis glycosides.  Discuss all medications and supplements with your physician before taking calcium carbonate.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), those with a history of kidney stones, and individuals with impaired renal function.  Monitor calcium levels closely, especially in patients with CKD or those taking high doses.  In patients with impaired kidney function,  the dosage may need to be adjusted and non-calcium based phosphate binders may be considered.  Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals should consult their physician before using calcium carbonate supplements.  The RDA for calcium during pregnancy or lactation is the same as for non-pregnant or non-lactating women.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be needed for individuals with significantly reduced kidney function (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min).
* **Dietary Considerations:**  Avoid excessive consumption of oxalate-rich foods (like spinach and rhubarb) while taking calcium carbonate, as this can reduce calcium absorption.

### FAQs


* **Q: Can I take calcium carbonate with other medications?** A:  Always consult your physician or pharmacist.  Calcium carbonate interacts with certain medications, impacting their absorption or efficacy.  Specific interactions are listed in the precautions section.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: How should I store calcium carbonate?** A:  Store in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q:  Are there any long-term risks associated with taking calcium carbonate?**  A: While generally safe, long-term high-dose supplementation can potentially lead to hypercalcemia. Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is recommended.
* **Q: Is calcium carbonate safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A: While calcium is essential during pregnancy and lactation, consult your doctor before taking calcium carbonate supplements to ensure the dosage is appropriate.
