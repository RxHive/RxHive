# Celecoxib
### Generic Name
Celecoxib

### Usage
Celecoxib is a COX-2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Its primary use is for the relief of signs and symptoms associated with various inflammatory conditions, including:

*   **Osteoarthritis:**  A degenerative joint disease causing pain and stiffness.
*   **Rheumatoid arthritis:** An autoimmune disease causing chronic inflammation in the joints.
*   **Ankylosing spondylitis:** A type of arthritis primarily affecting the spine.
*   **Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA):** A chronic inflammatory condition affecting children's joints.

Celecoxib is also used to treat:

*   **Primary dysmenorrhea:** Painful menstrual cramps.
*   **Acute pain:** Short-term pain relief from various causes.  It's sometimes used off-label for acute gout flares, but this requires careful consideration by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** The lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration necessary, as determined by a physician.  Due to cardiovascular risks, use should generally be avoided in patients with established cardiovascular disease or risk factors.

**Adults:**  Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated.  Oral administration is standard.

*   **Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis:** 100-200 mg twice daily (BID) or 200 mg once daily (OD). Higher doses (up to 400 mg/day for ankylosing spondylitis) may be considered if the lower dose is ineffective after 6 weeks, but only under physician supervision.
*   **Acute pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea:** 400 mg initially, followed by 200 mg BID as needed.
*   **Ankylosing Spondylitis:** 200 mg OD or 100 mg BID.  May increase to 400 mg/day if needed after 6 weeks.  Discontinue if no response after 6 weeks at 400 mg/day.


**Children (Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis):**

*   Oral administration only, for children aged 2 years and older and weighing at least 10 kg:
    *   10-25 kg: 50 mg BID
    *   >25 kg: 100 mg BID

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, or those who are poor metabolizers of the drug (CYP2C9 poor metabolizers).  Always consult a doctor before adjusting dosage.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

*   Peripheral edema (swelling)
*   Diarrhea
*   Dyspepsia (indigestion)
*   Abdominal pain
*   Flatulence (gas)
*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
*   Vomiting
*   Increased liver enzymes (less than 3 times the upper limit of normal)

**Serious, but Less Common Side Effects:**

*   Gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, perforation, inflammation
*   Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke)
*   Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
*   Skin reactions (exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
*   Renal failure


Any unusual or concerning side effects require immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Celecoxib works by selectively inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme involved in the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are substances that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever. By blocking COX-2, celecoxib reduces inflammation and alleviates pain and fever.  Importantly, it does not significantly inhibit COX-1, an enzyme crucial for protecting the stomach lining and promoting blood clotting, thus theoretically reducing the risk of gastrointestinal side effects compared to non-selective NSAIDs.  However, cardiovascular risk remains a significant concern.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Celecoxib is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to celecoxib, sulfonamides, aspirin, other NSAIDs, or any formulation component; those with a history of aspirin or NSAID-induced asthma, urticaria, or allergic reactions; patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery; during the third trimester of pregnancy; breastfeeding women; those with severe, uncontrolled heart failure; active gastrointestinal ulcers or bleeding; inflammatory bowel disease; cerebrovascular bleeding; severe liver impairment; severe renal impairment; or known hyperkalemia.  It's also generally not recommended for children under 18 except when used specifically for juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
*   **Interactions:** Celecoxib can interact with numerous other medications, including anticoagulants, diuretics, and other drugs affecting kidney or liver function.  Consult with a physician or pharmacist regarding potential drug interactions.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy is generally not recommended, especially during the third trimester.  It's unknown if celecoxib is safe for breastfeeding infants.
*   **Elderly:** Elderly individuals are at higher risk for gastrointestinal side effects.
*   **Cardiovascular Risk:** Celecoxib carries an increased risk of cardiovascular events.  This should be carefully weighed against the benefits before starting treatment, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors.  This risk is clearly outlined in a boxed warning.
*   **Gastrointestinal Risk:**  A boxed warning exists regarding the potential for serious gastrointestinal side effects.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take Celecoxib with other medications?**  A:  It's crucial to discuss all medications and supplements with your doctor or pharmacist before starting Celecoxib, due to potential interactions.
*   **Q: How should I store Celecoxib?** A: Store Celecoxib as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.  Always consult your prescribing physician if you miss multiple doses.
*   **Q:  Can I stop taking Celecoxib suddenly?** A: No, do not abruptly discontinue Celecoxib without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly may lead to adverse effects.  Your doctor will develop a tapering schedule if necessary.
*   **Q: Is Celecoxib habit-forming?** A: Celecoxib is not considered habit-forming.
