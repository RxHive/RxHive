# Cannabidiol
### Generic Name
Cannabidiol (CBD)

### Usage

Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid approved for treating seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis complex in patients aged 1 year and older.  It's important to note that this is its primary approved use; research into its potential benefits for other conditions is ongoing, but it's not yet approved for these off-label uses.


### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and depends on the specific condition being treated (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis complex), the patient's weight, and their response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage regimen meticulously, as provided by a healthcare professional.  The information below is for general understanding and should not be interpreted as a prescription.

**Oral Administration (most common):**

* **Initial Dose:** Typically starts at 2.5 mg/kg twice daily (BID).
* **Titration:** The dose is usually increased gradually, often in weekly increments of 2.5 mg/kg BID,  under close medical supervision.  The maximum dose varies depending on the condition and patient response.  For Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, the maximum is often 10 mg/kg BID. For tuberous sclerosis complex, it may be higher (12.5 mg/kg BID).  In some cases, more rapid titration might be considered under specific circumstances.
* **Discontinuation:**  Always decrease the dosage gradually when stopping treatment to minimize the risk of increased seizures. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors such as hepatic impairment (liver problems).  Patients with liver problems will usually require a lower starting dose and slower titration. Renal impairment (kidney problems) generally does not require dosage adjustments, according to current labeling.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Dosage for children is calculated based on weight, following the same principles as adult dosing but with careful monitoring for side effects.  Maximum daily doses are different for children compared to adults.


**Always consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dosage for each individual patient.**

### How it Works

The exact mechanism by which cannabidiol works to reduce seizures isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to interact with several endogenous systems in the brain and body that influence seizure activity.  It doesn't appear to primarily act on cannabinoid receptors, unlike other cannabinoids like THC.  Its effects may involve:

* Modulation of neuronal inhibition (affecting GABAergic neurotransmission)
* Influence on intracellular calcium levels
* Potential anti-inflammatory actions


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cannabidiol is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to cannabidiol or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Cannabidiol can interact with several medications, potentially altering their effectiveness or causing adverse effects.  Discuss all medications (prescription and over-the-counter) and supplements with your doctor before starting cannabidiol.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with liver problems.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of cannabidiol during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider.
* **Mental Health:**  There are post-marketing reports of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.  Close monitoring is warranted for individuals with existing mental health conditions.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Cannabidiol can cause drowsiness; avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take cannabidiol with other medications?**  A: It's crucial to discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your doctor or pharmacist before taking cannabidiol, as it can interact with other drugs.


* **Q: How should I store cannabidiol?** A:  Store it as directed on the product label, usually in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat.


* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.


* **Q: Is cannabidiol addictive?** A:  Cannabidiol is not considered an addictive substance.


* **Q:  Is cannabidiol right for everyone with epilepsy?** A: No.  It's only approved for specific types of epilepsy and only prescribed for those who haven't found sufficient relief from other treatments. Your doctor will make that determination.
