# Cyclofenil
### Generic Name
Cyclofenil

### Usage
Cyclofenil is a selective estrogen receptor modulator primarily used to treat infertility in women caused by ovulation problems stemming from hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction.  It's also used to manage menstrual cycle irregularities.  While not its primary indication, it may be considered for other conditions related to hormonal imbalances in women, but this should always be discussed with a doctor.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For anovulatory infertility or menstrual disorders, the typical adult dosage is 200 mg three times daily (TID) for five days, repeated cyclically for three to four cycles.  This regimen is strictly for oral administration.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of cyclofenil in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Cyclofenil is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease.  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with renal impairment, however, this should be discussed with a physician before using the drug.


### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Hot flashes
* Loss of appetite
* Headaches
* Galactorrhea (abnormal milk production)
* Ovulatory pain (pain during ovulation)  These are usually transient (temporary).

Less common, but potentially serious side effects may occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.

### How it Works
Cyclofenil is a non-steroidal antiestrogen. While the precise mechanism isn't fully elucidated, it's thought to act by modulating the effects of estrogen on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. This modulation helps to restore the normal hormonal balance necessary for ovulation and regular menstrual cycles. In essence, it helps regulate the hormones involved in the reproductive process.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Cyclofenil is contraindicated (absolutely should not be used) in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to cyclofenil
* Acute or chronic liver disease
* Unexplained uterine bleeding
* Pregnancy

**Warnings:**  This medication should be used with caution in women with a history of liver problems. Regular monitoring of liver function may be necessary.  The medication should be used with caution and under close medical supervision in women with any underlying health issues.

**Interactions:**  Currently, no significant drug interactions are specifically documented with cyclofenil. However, it is crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are currently taking.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Cyclofenil is contraindicated during pregnancy.  It's unknown whether it's excreted in breast milk; therefore, it's advisable to avoid breastfeeding while taking this medication.
