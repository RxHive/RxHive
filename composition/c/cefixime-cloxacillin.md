# Cefixime + Cloxacillin
### Generic Name
Cefixime + Cloxacillin

**Please Note:**  Cefixime and Cloxacillin are typically prescribed as *separate* medications, not as a fixed-dose combination.  A doctor might prescribe them together for a specific infection based on the individual's needs. This information should not be interpreted as a recommendation for self-medication. Always consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.  The following information describes each antibiotic individually.  Their combined effect would depend on the specific dosages and the infection being treated.


### Cefixime Usage

Cefixime is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. Its primary use is in treating infections of the respiratory tract (like bronchitis and pneumonia), ear infections (otitis media), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and some skin infections.  It's also sometimes used to treat gonorrhea, but resistance is becoming increasingly common, so this use requires careful consideration by a healthcare professional.

### Cloxacillin Usage

Cloxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin antibiotic.  Its primary use is in treating infections caused by penicillinase-producing bacteria,  which are strains of bacteria that can break down standard penicillin. These infections often involve skin and soft tissue, bone and joint infections (osteomyelitis), and sometimes endocarditis (infection of the heart lining).  It's not effective against many common bacteria that other penicillins can treat.


### Dosage (Cefixime & Cloxacillin)

**Dosage must be determined by a doctor based on the specific infection, the patient's age, weight, kidney function, and overall health.**  There's no standard fixed-dose combination.

* **Cefixime:**  Oral dosages typically range from 200mg to 400mg once or twice daily for adults. Pediatric dosages vary greatly based on weight and age and are always determined by a physician.  Intravenous administration is also possible but requires medical supervision.

* **Cloxacillin:**  Oral dosages vary significantly based on the severity of the infection, typically ranging from 250mg to 500mg every six hours for adults.  Higher doses may be used in severe cases.  Intravenous formulations are common in hospital settings and dosages are determined by a physician.  Pediatric dosages are weight-based and must be determined by a physician.



### Side Effects (Cefixime & Cloxacillin)

**Cefixime:** Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and headache.  Less common but more serious side effects include allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), and colitis (inflammation of the colon).

**Cloxacillin:** Common side effects can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.  Less common, but serious, are allergic reactions (similar to Cefixime's side effects), and liver problems (hepatitis).  A rare but serious side effect is neutropenia (low white blood cell count), increasing risk of infection.


### How it Works (Cefixime & Cloxacillin)

* **Cefixime:** This antibiotic inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, preventing the bacteria from building and maintaining their cell walls.  This leads to bacterial cell death.

* **Cloxacillin:**  Similar to Cefixime, Cloxacillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis. However, its specific chemical structure makes it resistant to breakdown by penicillinase enzymes, allowing it to be effective against penicillinase-producing bacteria.


### Precautions (Cefixime & Cloxacillin)

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Both drugs carry a risk of serious allergic reactions. Anyone with a known allergy to penicillins or cephalosporins should avoid these medications.

* **Kidney Function:**  Cefixime is primarily excreted by the kidneys; therefore, dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function.

* **Liver Function:**  Cloxacillin can affect liver function; individuals with pre-existing liver conditions should be closely monitored.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of both medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful evaluation by a physician to weigh the risks and benefits.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Both medications can interact with other drugs; it's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.

* **Inflammatory Bowel Disease:**  Cefixime use may exacerbate existing inflammatory bowel disease.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Cefixime and Cloxacillin together without a doctor's prescription?**
    * **A:** No.  These are prescription medications, and the decision to use them together, as well as the specific dosages, should always be made by a healthcare professional.

* **Q: How should I store these medications?**
    * **A:** Store both medications as directed on the label, usually at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**
    * **A:** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.

* **Q: Are these medications safe for children?**
    * **A:**  Pediatric dosages are significantly different than adult dosages and require careful calculation by a physician.  These medications should only be given to children under strict medical supervision.

* **Q:  How long should I take these medications?**
    * **A:**  The treatment duration is determined by your doctor based on the severity of the infection and your response to treatment.  Do not stop taking the medications prematurely, even if you feel better.  This could lead to antibiotic resistance.
