# Capsaicin
### Generic Name
Capsaicin

### Usage

Capsaicin is primarily used as a topical analgesic to treat neuropathic pain.  This means it's effective for pain caused by nerve damage, not damage to the tissues themselves.  Specifically, it's indicated for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a lingering nerve pain after shingles, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in the feet.  It's also used for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains in muscles and joints related to conditions like simple backache, muscle strains, sprains, arthritis, bruises, and cramps.  While often used off-label for other types of pain, its primary applications remain in neuropathic pain management and minor musculoskeletal discomfort.


### Dosage

Capsaicin dosage varies greatly depending on the specific formulation (cream, lotion, patch), the condition being treated, and the patient's age.  Always follow the instructions provided with the specific product you are using.

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Neuropathic Pain (PHN, DPN):**  High-concentration (8%) patches are typically applied by a healthcare professional.  For DPN, up to four patches may be applied to the feet for a single 30-minute application.  For PHN, up to four patches may be applied for a 60-minute application.  These high-concentration treatments are usually repeated every three months, as needed, but not more frequently.  Lower-concentration creams and lotions (e.g., 0.075%) may be applied up to four times daily for DPN, but this is often off-label use.

* **Muscle/Joint Pain:**  Lower-concentration patches (0.025% - 0.0375%) are typically applied for up to 8 hours, with a maximum of 4 patches per day for a maximum of 5 consecutive days.  Creams, gels, liquids, and lotions (0.025% - 0.1%) are applied as a thin film 3-4 times daily.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and effectiveness of high-concentration (8%) patches in children under 18 haven't been established.  Lower-concentration formulations are sometimes used in children aged 2 years and older for minor muscle and joint pain, but dosages vary widely depending on the specific product and the child's age and weight.  Always consult a pediatrician before using capsaicin on a child.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Local skin redness and pain at the application site
* Burning sensation

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypertension (high blood pressure), especially with high-concentration patches
* Nausea and vomiting
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Dizziness or headache
* Eye irritation (if contact occurs)


If you experience any side effects, particularly severe or persistent ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Capsaicin works by activating TRPV1 receptors, which are found on nerve cells involved in sensing pain and temperature. This activation initially causes a burning sensation, but prolonged exposure leads to a depletion of substance P, a neurotransmitter that transmits pain signals. This depletion reduces pain signals to the brain, leading to pain relief. The effect is temporary, and pain sensations typically return after the substance P levels are replenished.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Capsaicin should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to capsaicin, menthol, or any other ingredient in the formulation.

* **Interactions:** Capsaicin may interact with other medications, particularly topical analgesics. Do not use it concurrently with other topical pain relievers without consulting your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Specific Warnings:**
    * **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While categorized as pregnancy category B, it's best to consult your doctor before using capsaicin if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
    * **Children:**  Use in children should be under the strict guidance of a pediatrician due to limited data on long-term effects.
    * **Elderly:** Older adults may have more sensitive skin and should use lower concentrations and monitor for skin reactions.
    * **Damaged Skin:** Avoid application to broken, irritated, or wounded skin.
    * **Eyes and Mucous Membranes:**  Avoid contact with eyes, mouth, and genitals. Rinse thoroughly with water if contact occurs.

* **Other precautions:** Avoid using near external heat sources, such as heating pads. Do not cover the application site with bandages unless otherwise directed by a healthcare professional. Wash hands thoroughly after applying, unless the hands are the treatment area.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for capsaicin to work?** A: The onset of pain relief varies, but it can take several applications before noticing a significant effect.

* **Q: How long should I use capsaicin?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the condition and your doctor's recommendations.  For some conditions, intermittent use is recommended.

* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get capsaicin in my eyes?** A: Immediately flush your eyes with plenty of cool water for at least 15 minutes and seek medical attention if irritation persists.

* **Q: Can I use capsaicin with other pain medications?** A: It's essential to discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist.  Some interactions are possible.
