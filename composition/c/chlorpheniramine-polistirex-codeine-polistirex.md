# Chlorpheniramine Polistirex + Codeine Polistirex
### Generic Name
Chlorpheniramine Polistirex + Codeine Polistirex

### Usage

This combination medication is used to relieve cough and symptoms associated with upper respiratory allergies or the common cold in adults.  Chlorpheniramine polistirex, an antihistamine, helps reduce allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes. Codeine polistirex is an opioid cough suppressant that reduces the urge to cough.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is **not** for treating a persistent or chronic cough, and it's not suitable for children.


### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical dose is 10 mL of the extended-release suspension every 12 hours.  Do not exceed a total of 20 mL (two doses) within a 24-hour period. Each 5 mL dose contains Codeine polistirex (equivalent to 20 mg codeine phosphate) and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex (equivalent to 4 mg Chlorpheniramine maleate).

**Children:** This medication is **not** recommended for use in children under 18 years of age.  There are significant risks associated with codeine use in children, including life-threatening respiratory depression.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Use with extreme caution in patients with severe liver or kidney disease.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Respiratory depression (slowed or difficult breathing) â€“ this is especially serious and requires immediate medical attention.
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)
* Seizures
* Severe hypotension (low blood pressure)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Chlorpheniramine polistirex blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released during allergic reactions. This helps reduce inflammation in the respiratory tract, alleviating symptoms like runny nose and sneezing. Codeine polistirex acts on the brain to suppress the cough reflex.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity to codeine, chlorpheniramine, or any component of the formulation; in those with hypersensitivity to other opioids; in children under 12 years of age; in children under 18 years of age after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy; in patients with head trauma or increased intracranial pressure.
* **Interactions:**  This combination can interact with other medications, particularly those that depress the central nervous system (CNS), such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, other opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, or anti-anxiety agents.  Concomitant use may lead to additive CNS depression.  Interactions are also possible with MAO inhibitors and TCAs. The use of MAO inhibitors or TCAs with codeine preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or codeine.  Concurrent use with other anticholinergic drugs should be approached with caution.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with any other medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  This medication is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Codeine and chlorpheniramine are excreted in breast milk, and breastfeeding is not recommended while using this medication.  Use during labor can cause respiratory depression in the newborn.
* **Other Precautions:** Use caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency, acute abdominal conditions, underlying intestinal motility disorders, prostatic hyperplasia/urinary obstruction, pulmonary disease, thyroid dysfunction, elderly or debilitated patients, and those performing tasks requiring mental alertness.
