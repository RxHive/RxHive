# Camostat

**Generic Name:** Camostat Mesylate

**Usage:**

Camostat mesylate is primarily used as a medication to treat pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).  It's also been investigated, though not widely approved, for potential use in treating other conditions, most notably COVID-19.  The use of camostat in COVID-19 is still under research, and its efficacy and safety in this context are not fully established.  Its use should only be under strict medical supervision.

**Side Effects:**

The most commonly reported side effects of camostat mesylate are gastrointestinal issues, including:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Constipation

Less common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash
* Elevated liver enzymes (indicating potential liver damage)

Serious side effects are rare but possible and may include allergic reactions.  Immediate medical attention is required if you experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or hives.

**How it Works:**

Camostat mesylate is a serine protease inhibitor.  This means it blocks the activity of certain enzymes called serine proteases.  In the context of pancreatitis, it inhibits the activation of trypsinogen to trypsin, a key enzyme involved in the damaging inflammatory cascade in the pancreas.  In the context of COVID-19 research, its proposed mechanism of action involves inhibiting transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), an enzyme crucial for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) into human cells.  By inhibiting TMPRSS2, it may potentially reduce the virus's ability to infect cells.

* **Can I buy camostat mesylate without a prescription?**  No, camostat mesylate is a prescription medication and should only be obtained through a doctor's prescription.  Purchasing it without a prescription is illegal and potentially dangerous.
* **Is camostat mesylate safe?**  Like all medications, camostat mesylate carries potential side effects.  The risks and benefits must be carefully weighed by a healthcare professional before prescribing it.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  If you experience any side effects while taking camostat mesylate, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.
