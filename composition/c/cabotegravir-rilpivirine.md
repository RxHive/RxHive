# Cabotegravir + Rilpivirine
### Generic Name
Cabotegravir + Rilpivirine

### Usage

Cabotegravir and Rilpivirine is a combination medication used to treat HIV-1 infection in adults.  It's specifically designed as a replacement for existing oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) in individuals who are already virologically suppressed (meaning their HIV-1 RNA levels are below 50 copies/mL) and have been stable on their current regimen for a period of time.  It's crucial that patients have no history of treatment failure and show no signs of resistance to either Cabotegravir or Rilpivirine. This medication is administered as an intramuscular injection.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (HIV-1 Infection):**

The medication requires an initial oral lead-in period of at least 28 days before transitioning to injections. The initial injection consists of Cabotegravir 600 mg and Rilpivirine 900 mg, given intramuscularly (IM) on the final day of the oral lead-in phase.  A month later, continuation injections of Cabotegravir 400 mg and Rilpivirine 600 mg are given once monthly. Injections may be administered up to 7 days before or after the scheduled date.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and effectiveness of Cabotegravir and Rilpivirine in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B), no dosage adjustment is necessary.  Dosage adjustments for those with severe impairment (Child-Pugh class C) haven't been established.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 mL/min or greater.  Data on dosage adjustments for patients with CrCl less than 30 mL/min or those on dialysis is not available; use should be approached cautiously.  Due to the high protein binding of the drugs, dialysis isn't expected to significantly alter Cabotegravir exposure.
* **Missed Doses:**  If a patient plans to miss an injection by more than 7 days, oral therapy should replace up to two consecutive monthly injections. If injections are missed unexpectedly by more than 7 days without interim oral therapy, clinical reassessment is necessary.  The approach to resuming injections varies depending on the time since the last injection (â‰¤2 months versus >2 months).

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**  Injection site reactions (discomfort, induration, nodules, pain, redness, swelling, warmth, bruising, hematoma, pruritus).

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**  Nervous system (abnormal dreams, anxiety, depression, dizziness, fatigue, headache, sleep disorders); dermatologic (skin rash); endocrine/metabolic (weight gain); gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, gastritis, nausea, vomiting); hepatic (increased liver enzyme levels, hepatotoxicity); hypersensitivity reactions;  musculoskeletal pain; increased creatine phosphokinase levels; fever.

**Rare Side Effects (<1%):**  Agitation, altered blood pressure, flushing, syncope, diaphoresis, abdominal cramps, oral paresthesia, increased bilirubin levels, dyspnea, abscess or cellulitis at injection site.

**Post-Marketing Reports:**  Abnormalities in thinking, depressed mood, dysphoria, emotional liability, major depressive disorder, mood changes, suicidal ideation, suicidal tendencies, severe dermatological reactions, nephrotic syndrome, DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms).


**Important Note:** This list isn't exhaustive.  If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Cabotegravir is an integrase inhibitor. It works by blocking the HIV integrase enzyme, preventing the virus from integrating its genetic material into the DNA of human cells. This stops the virus from replicating.

Rilpivirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). It inhibits the reverse transcriptase enzyme, another key enzyme in HIV replication, preventing the conversion of viral RNA into DNA.  The combination of these two drugs provides a potent antiviral effect.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to Cabotegravir, Rilpivirine, or any components of the formulation. It shouldn't be used concurrently with certain enzyme inducers like some anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), antimycobacterials (rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine), high-dose systemic dexamethasone, or St. John's wort.

**Warnings:** Increased risk of depressive disorders, hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, immune reconstitution syndrome, injection site reactions, and QTc prolongation.  Use with caution in patients with renal impairment or when coadministered with drugs that increase the risk of torsades de pointes.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Currently, this medication is not recommended for pregnant women or those planning pregnancy.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the injection last?**  A:  The continuation injections are designed to provide protection for approximately one month.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss an injection?** A: Consult your healthcare provider immediately to determine the appropriate course of action.  They will guide you on whether to start oral medication or resume injections and how.

* **Q:  How is the injection administered?** A: It's given intramuscularly, typically in the gluteal (buttock) muscle.

* **Q: Are there any specific storage instructions?** A: Store the medication according to the provided instructions.   Allow it to come to room temperature before use.

* **Q:  Can I take other medications while on Cabotegravir and Rilpivirine?** A:  It's essential to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential drug interactions.

* **Q: How is my progress monitored while on this treatment?** A: Your healthcare provider will monitor your liver function, watch for any signs of hypersensitivity or skin reactions, monitor injection site reactions, and check for mood changes.
