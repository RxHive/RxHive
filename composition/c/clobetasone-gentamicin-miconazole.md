# Clobetasone + Gentamicin + Miconazole

**Generic Name:** Clobetasone butyrate + Gentamicin + Miconazole

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid, antibiotic, and antifungal used to treat skin infections involving bacteria and fungi, often complicated by inflammation.  It's commonly prescribed for conditions like:

* **Secondary bacterial and fungal infections of eczema (atopic dermatitis):**  Where eczema has become infected.
* **Dermatophytoses (ringworm) with secondary bacterial infection:** Fungal infections complicated by bacterial infection.
* **Infected dermatoses:**  Various skin conditions with bacterial and fungal involvement.
* **Seborrheic dermatitis with secondary bacterial and fungal infection:**  A common inflammatory skin condition with added infection.


**Important Note:** This medication is for external use only.  It should not be used on the face, groin, or underarms unless specifically directed by a physician.  It is crucial to follow a doctor's instructions regarding duration of use.  Prolonged use can lead to undesirable side effects.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and duration of use.  Common side effects include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, itching, redness, dryness, or peeling at the application site.
* **Thinning of the skin:**  With prolonged use, the skin may become thinner and more fragile.
* **Stretch marks (striae):** Particularly with prolonged use on certain body areas.
* **Acne:** In some individuals.
* **Increased hair growth (hypertrichosis):**  In some individuals.
* **Skin discoloration (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation):**  Lightening or darkening of the skin.
* **Allergic contact dermatitis:** An allergic reaction to one or more components.
* **Systemic effects:** Rare but possible with prolonged use or extensive application, particularly in children.  These can include adrenal suppression (inhibition of adrenal gland function).


**How it Works:**

* **Clobetasone butyrate (corticosteroid):**  Reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune system's response at the application site.
* **Gentamicin (aminoglycoside antibiotic):** Kills bacteria that may be causing infection.
* **Miconazole (imidazole antifungal):** Kills fungi that may be causing infection.

The combination of these three active ingredients tackles the inflammation and both the bacterial and fungal components of the skin infection simultaneously.
