# Cefuroxime axetil
### Generic Name
Cefuroxime axetil

### Usage

Cefuroxime axetil is an antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections.  Its primary use is in treating infections of the respiratory tract, such as bronchitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis. It's also effective against skin and soft tissue infections, ear infections (otitis media), and urinary tract infections (UTIs).  In some cases, it may be used to treat certain sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea (though other antibiotics are often preferred for this).  The specific bacterial infections it targets are those susceptible to cephalosporin antibiotics, a class to which cefuroxime axetil belongs.  This means it's not effective against all types of bacteria; a doctor will determine its suitability based on the suspected causative organism.


### Dosage

Dosage of cefuroxime axetil varies depending on the type of infection, the patient's age and weight, and the severity of the illness.  Always follow your doctor's prescription instructions.  There isn't a standard IV formulation of cefuroxime axetil;  intravenous administration typically uses cefuroxime sodium, a different salt form of the same antibiotic.

**Oral (Cefuroxime Axetil):**

* **Adults:**  The typical dose ranges from 250mg to 500mg, taken twice daily.  Higher doses may be prescribed for severe infections.
* **Children:**  Dosage for children is determined by weight and the specific infection. A doctor will calculate the appropriate dose.  Liquid formulations are available for easier administration to children.

**Intravenous (Cefuroxime Sodium):**  This is a different salt form and is administered by a healthcare professional. The dosage is determined by the severity of the infection and the patient's condition.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of cefuroxime axetil are generally mild and may include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach upset
* Rash
* Headache
* Dizziness

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, and hives.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), a serious intestinal infection.
*  Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes) – indicating liver problems.
*  Seizures (in high doses or in individuals with predisposing conditions).

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Cefuroxime axetil is a beta-lactam antibiotic.  It works by inhibiting the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  By interfering with the construction of this wall, cefuroxime axetil prevents bacteria from growing and multiplying, ultimately leading to their death.  This mechanism effectively combats bacterial infections.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Cefuroxime axetil should not be used by individuals with known allergies to cephalosporin antibiotics or penicillin.  Cross-reactivity between these antibiotic classes can occur.
* **Kidney Problems:**  The dose may need to be adjusted for individuals with impaired kidney function to prevent drug accumulation.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe, cefuroxime axetil should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Consult your doctor.
* **Alcohol:**  While there's no direct interaction, excessive alcohol consumption can negatively impact overall health, so moderation is advised while taking any medication.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions may occur.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Drowsiness or dizziness are potential side effects. Avoid activities requiring alertness if affected.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking cefuroxime axetil when I feel better?**  A: No.  Complete the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed, even if you feel better, to prevent recurrence of the infection and the development of antibiotic resistance.

* **Q: Can I take cefuroxime axetil with antacids?** A: It’s best to avoid taking cefuroxime axetil with antacids or other medications that affect stomach acidity, as this can affect absorption. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions.

* **Q: How should I store cefuroxime axetil?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is cefuroxime axetil safe for children?** A: Yes, but the dosage must be adjusted based on the child's weight and the specific infection.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose.
