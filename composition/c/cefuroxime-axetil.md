# Cefuroxime axetil

**Generic Name:** Cefuroxime axetil

**Usage:** Cefuroxime axetil is an antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Respiratory tract infections:** Bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, tonsillitis.
* **Skin and skin structure infections:** Cellulitis, abscesses, impetigo.
* **Ear infections:** Otitis media (middle ear infection).
* **Genitourinary infections:**  Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs).


**Important Note:**  Cefuroxime axetil is only effective against bacterial infections. It will not work for viral infections like the common cold or flu.  Always consult a doctor to determine the appropriate antibiotic for your infection.  Improper use of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, cefuroxime axetil can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives.  In rare cases, more serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, or dizziness after taking this medication.
* **Other:** Headache, dizziness, vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis).


**How it Works:** Cefuroxime axetil is a cephalosporin antibiotic. It works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to build their cell walls.  This weakens the bacteria, leading to their death and ultimately resolving the infection.  It's important to note that Cefuroxime axetil is a prodrug; it's converted into the active form, cefuroxime, after it's absorbed by the body.

* **How long should I take cefuroxime axetil?**  The duration of treatment depends on the type and severity of the infection.
