# Cabergoline
### Generic Name
Cabergoline

### Usage

Cabergoline is primarily used to treat hyperprolactinemia, a condition characterized by excessive prolactin production.  This excess prolactin can lead to various issues, including menstrual irregularities or amenorrhea in women, infertility in both men and women, galactorrhea (spontaneous milk production), and decreased libido.  The underlying cause of hyperprolactinemia can be idiopathic (unknown cause) or due to pituitary adenomas (tumors in the pituitary gland).

Cabergoline is also sometimes used off-label for other conditions, including:

* **Cushing's syndrome:** This involves the body producing too much cortisol. While not a typical usage, it may be considered in some cases.
* **Restless legs syndrome (RLS):**  Cabergoline has shown some efficacy in treating this neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs. However, this is an off-label use, and other medications are typically preferred for RLS.
* **Lactation suppression:**  Although not recommended for routine use, cabergoline can be employed postpartum to inhibit lactation.


### Dosage

**Important Note:** The following information is for general knowledge only and should not be considered medical advice.  Dosage must be determined and adjusted by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and response.

**Adults:**

* **Hyperprolactinemia:**  The initial dose is typically 0.25 mg twice weekly.  The dose may be increased gradually (usually by 0.25 mg twice weekly) up to a maximum of 1 mg twice weekly, depending on the patientâ€™s serum prolactin levels.  Dose adjustments should be done cautiously and at intervals of at least four weeks.  After six months of normal prolactin levels, cabergoline might be discontinued and monitored.  Long-term efficacy beyond 24 months hasn't been fully established.  Alternative dosing regimens exist, starting with 0.5 mg once weekly or 0.25 mg twice weekly, titrated upwards as needed.
* **Lactation Inhibition:** A single 1 mg dose is usually given on the first postpartum day.
* **Cushing's Syndrome (off-label):** Initial dose can vary (0.5 mg once weekly or 1 mg weekly).  Dosage increases are gradual, aiming for normalization of urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels. The maximum weekly dose is typically 7 mg.
* **Restless Legs Syndrome (off-label):** Initial dose is typically 0.5 mg, three hours before bedtime.  The dose may be increased gradually in increments of 0.5 mg every 3-7 days as needed, with the usual dose being around 2mg.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of cabergoline in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically provided for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  For patients with severe hepatic impairment, caution is advised, and close monitoring is essential.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Cabergoline is a dopamine agonist, meaning it mimics the effects of dopamine in the brain.  Dopamine plays a crucial role in regulating prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland. By binding to dopamine receptors, cabergoline inhibits prolactin release, thereby reducing the symptoms of hyperprolactinemia.  Cabergoline also has affinity for serotonin receptors; this aspect may contribute to some of its side effects.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cabergoline is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, a history of cardiac valvular disorders, or a history of pulmonary, pericardial, or retroperitoneal fibrotic disorders.  It should not be used in those hypersensitive to cabergoline or ergot derivatives.
* **Drug Interactions:** Cabergoline can interact with various medications, including some antidepressants, antipsychotics, and other drugs.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Cabergoline is generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus or infant.  Use should be carefully considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.
* **Other Precautions:** Cabergoline may cause orthostatic hypotension, so patients should be advised to rise slowly from a sitting or lying position. Patients should also be aware of the potential for psychiatric side effects and other adverse effects outlined previously. Regular monitoring, such as blood pressure checks and echocardiograms may be needed.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Cabergoline?** A:  The time to see results varies depending on the condition being treated and individual response.  It can take several weeks or months for noticeable improvements.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Cabergoline suddenly?** A: No. Always consult your doctor before stopping cabergoline treatment.  Sudden cessation can potentially lead to a rebound in prolactin levels.

* **Q: How should Cabergoline be stored?** A: Store Cabergoline as directed by your pharmacist or healthcare provider, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your next dose. Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Is Cabergoline addictive?** A:  Cabergoline is not considered addictive in the same way as opioids or other substances. However, abrupt cessation after long-term use should be done under medical supervision.

* **Q: Can Cabergoline cause weight gain or loss?** A: Weight changes have been reported in some patients, both gain and loss.  The exact cause is not fully understood.  If you experience significant weight changes while taking cabergoline, consult your physician.
