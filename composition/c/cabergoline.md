# Cabergoline

**Generic Name:** Cabergoline

**Usage:**

Cabergoline is primarily used to treat hyperprolactinemia (high levels of prolactin in the blood), a condition that can cause various symptoms such as:

* **In women:** Irregular periods, infertility, galactorrhea (milk production outside of pregnancy or breastfeeding), and menstrual irregularities.
* **In men:** Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility.

It's also used to treat:

* **Parkinson's disease:**  As an adjunct therapy to levodopa, to improve motor control and reduce the "wearing-off" effect of levodopa.
* **Prolactinomas:**  Benign tumors of the pituitary gland that produce excess prolactin.


**Side Effects:**

Cabergoline can cause a range of side effects, some common and others rare but potentially serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are relatively common, especially at the start of treatment.
* **Headache:**  Can be mild to moderate in severity.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty passing stools.
* **Orthostatic hypotension:** A sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing, which can cause dizziness or fainting.


Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* **Fibrosis (scarring):**  This is a rare but potentially serious side effect that can affect the heart valves (valvular heart disease), lungs, and other organs. Regular monitoring is crucial, especially with long-term use.
* **Pulmonary hypertension:**  High blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired.
* **Depression:**  Changes in mood.
* **Hallucinations:** Seeing or hearing things that aren't there.

This is not an exhaustive list and other side effects can occur.  Always consult a doctor if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.


**How it Works:**

Cabergoline is a dopamine agonist.  This means it mimics the effects of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain.  In the case of hyperprolactinemia, it works by suppressing the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland.  In Parkinson's disease, it helps to stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain, improving motor control.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?** The effects of cabergoline can vary, but improvements in prolactin levels are usually seen within a few weeks.  The response to cabergoline in Parkinson's disease is also gradual.

* **How is it administered?** Cabergoline is typically taken orally as a tablet.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking cabergoline?**  It's generally advised to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking cabergoline, as it can worsen some side effects, particularly dizziness and orthostatic hypotension.

* **Can I stop taking cabergoline suddenly?** No, you should never stop taking cabergoline suddenly without consulting your doctor.  The dosage should be gradually reduced under medical supervision to prevent withdrawal symptoms or a rebound effect.

* **Who shouldn't take cabergoline?**  Individuals with a history of heart valve problems, pulmonary hypertension, or hypersensitivity to cabergoline should not take this medication. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also generally avoid it.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
