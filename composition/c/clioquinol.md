# Clioquinol
### Generic Name
Clioquinol

### Usage
Clioquinol is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, effective against bacteria and fungi. Its primary use is in topical treatment of various fungal skin infections such as athlete's foot (tinea pedis), ringworm (tinea corporis), and jock itch (tinea cruris).  It's also used in combination with other medications, notably corticosteroids like flumethasone, for the treatment of steroid-responsive otic (ear) infections and certain dermatological conditions.  The combination combats both the infection and inflammation.  It's important to note that clioquinol is not effective against fungal infections of the scalp or nails.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the formulation used (cream, ointment, or solution).  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.

**Topical Fungal Infections (Cream/Ointment 3%):** Apply a thin layer 2-4 times daily to the affected area(s), ensuring the skin is clean and dry beforehand.  Treatment duration typically ranges from 2 weeks (jock itch) to 4 weeks (athlete's foot or ringworm).

**Dermatologic Disorders (Cream 3% or 4%):** Apply a thin film 3-4 times daily.  This is often used in conjunction with hydrocortisone.

**Otic Infections (Solution, usually combined with flumethasone):**  Instill 2-3 drops into the affected ear(s) twice daily (BID). Treatment should not exceed 10 days.

**Pediatric Dosage:** For dermatological disorders in children aged 2-16 years, the dosage is generally the same as for adults; however, always consult a pediatrician before administering to children.  Clioquinol is contraindicated in children under 2 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

* Itching
* Burning
* Irritation
* Stinging
* Redness
* Swelling

While rare, severe neurotoxicity is a potential, serious side effect.  Stop using clioquinol and seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual neurological symptoms.


### How it Works

Clioquinol is a hydroxyquinoline derivative that works by interfering with the enzymes necessary for DNA synthesis in bacteria and fungi.  By inhibiting this process, it prevents the microorganisms from replicating and effectively combats the infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Clioquinol is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to clioquinol or any of its components, children under 2 years of age, and should not be applied to broken skin, eczematous areas, or a perforated eardrum.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of clioquinol during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.  Use should be avoided during pregnancy and only considered during breastfeeding if the potential benefits significantly outweigh the risks to the infant.
* **Interactions:**  While specific drug interactions are not extensively documented, always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements) you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes.  Prolonged use should be avoided. Discontinue use if local irritation, rash, or sensitivity develops. Clioquinol may stain fabric and skin.
