# Cinchocaine + Policresulen
### Generic Name
Cinchocaine + Policresulen

**Note:**  Cinchocaine and Policresulen are typically used in combination as a topical anesthetic and antiseptic.  There isn't a single, universally recognized generic name for this specific combination.  The information below describes the individual components and their combined effects.  Always refer to the specific product labeling for complete and accurate information.


### Usage

Cinchocaine and Policresulen are used together in topical solutions or ointments primarily for surface anesthesia and antisepsis, particularly in procedures involving mucous membranes.  The combination provides both numbing (anesthesia) and germ-killing (antiseptic) effects.  Primary uses include:

* **Local anesthesia before minor surgical procedures:** This includes procedures on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, throat, and urethra.  Examples could be biopsies, minor surgical excisions, or the insertion of catheters.
* **Relief of pain and discomfort:**  The anesthetic effect can help manage pain associated with minor wounds, burns, or other surface irritations.
* **Prevention of infection:**  The antiseptic action of Policresulen helps reduce the risk of infection at the site of application.

It's crucial to understand that this combination is for *topical use only* and should never be ingested or injected.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary considerably depending on the specific product formulation (concentration of Cinchocaine and Policresulen, form of the product â€“ solution, ointment, etc.), the area of application, and the procedure.  **There is no standard dosage that can be provided here.**  Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional and the product label meticulously.  Improper use can lead to adverse effects.  Pediatric use requires special caution and precise instructions from a physician.  The product should never be used beyond the stated expiry date.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Burning or stinging sensation at the application site, temporary redness, mild swelling.
* **Less Common, but Serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing),  systemic absorption leading to central nervous system effects (rare, but possible with excessive application or compromised skin barrier), prolonged numbness.
* **Other Potential Side Effects:**  These can vary depending on individual sensitivity and the specific formulation.  Always report any unusual symptoms to a healthcare professional immediately.

**Note:** If you experience any significant side effects, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

* **Cinchocaine:** This is a local anesthetic that works by blocking nerve impulses, preventing the transmission of pain signals from the area of application to the brain. It achieves this by binding to sodium channels in nerve cell membranes, thereby inhibiting the flow of sodium ions and interrupting nerve conduction.
* **Policresulen:** This is an antiseptic agent with broad-spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Its exact mechanism is complex, but it's believed to denature proteins and disrupt cell membranes of microorganisms, leading to their inactivation.

The combined effect provides both pain relief and infection control at the site of application.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:**  Individuals with known allergies to any component of the preparation (including other local anesthetics or antiseptic agents) should avoid use.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be guided by a physician; the benefits must outweigh potential risks.
* **Children:**  Use in children should only be under strict medical supervision due to the potential for increased sensitivity and the risk of accidental ingestion.
* **Wounds:** Avoid application to deep or extensive wounds without medical guidance.
* **Damaged Skin:**  Avoid use on broken or severely damaged skin.
* **Interaction with Other Drugs:**  While not commonly known to have significant interactions, it is best to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Eye Contact:** Avoid contact with the eyes; in case of accidental eye contact, flush immediately with plenty of water and seek medical advice.
