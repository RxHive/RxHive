# Calcium Citrate
### Generic Name
Calcium Citrate

### Usage
Calcium citrate is primarily used as a dietary supplement to increase calcium intake. Calcium is a crucial mineral for various bodily functions, most notably building and maintaining strong bones and teeth.  Adequate calcium intake is essential throughout life, but especially important during childhood, adolescence, and in older adults to prevent osteoporosis and other bone-related issues.  Secondary uses might include the management of hypocalcemia (low blood calcium) under a doctor's supervision, though this is usually handled with other forms of calcium or in conjunction with other treatments. It's important to remember that calcium citrate is a supplement, and it shouldn't replace a balanced diet rich in calcium-containing foods.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on age, individual needs, and the specific reason for taking calcium citrate.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions.  

**Adults:** The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for calcium varies by age and sex.  Over-the-counter (OTC) calcium citrate supplements typically provide between 200-1000mg of elemental calcium per day, which may be taken as a single dose or split into multiple doses.  For adults over 50, the RDA is generally higher.  For the treatment of hypocalcemia (under a doctor's care), much higher doses may be required, adjusted based on blood calcium levels.

**Children:** The RDA for calcium in children varies greatly with age.  Pediatric dosages should always be determined and monitored by a pediatrician, and self-medication should be avoided completely.  Never give children adult doses of calcium citrate.

**Forms:** Calcium citrate is available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, and chewable tablets.  Follow the specific instructions provided with the product.

**Administration:**  Oral administration is standard for calcium citrate.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Constipation
* Bloating
* Gas
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain

Less common, but more serious side effects include hypercalcemia (high blood calcium). Symptoms of hypercalcemia can range from mild to severe and include:

* Excessive thirst
* Frequent urination
* Nausea and vomiting
* Constipation
* Muscle weakness
* Confusion
* Kidney stones


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed above, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Calcium citrate works by providing supplemental calcium to the body.  Once ingested and absorbed in the gut, the calcium ions are made bioavailable and utilized by the body for various functions.  It helps to maintain calcium levels, supporting bone health and other processes regulated by calcium, such as nerve and muscle function.  The citrate form is generally better absorbed than some other forms of calcium, particularly in those with low stomach acid.

### Precautions
* **Allergies:**  Do not use if you are allergic to calcium citrate or any of its ingredients.
* **Kidney Stones:**  Use with caution in individuals with a history of kidney stones, as high calcium intake can exacerbate this condition.  Your doctor may monitor your kidney function if you have kidney problems.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Those with impaired kidney function should take calcium citrate only under close medical supervision. Calcium accumulation can occur. 
* **Hypercalcemia:**  Avoid in patients with hypercalcemia (high levels of calcium in the blood).
* **Drug Interactions:** Calcium citrate can interact with certain medications, including some antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones), bisphosphonates, thyroid medications, and others. Inform your healthcare provider of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While calcium is essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding, consult your doctor before taking any calcium supplements.  Though generally considered safe, higher than recommended doses might cause problems.
* **Other Conditions:**  Individuals with certain medical conditions should discuss the use of calcium citrate with their doctor.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take calcium citrate with food?** A: Calcium citrate can be taken with or without food, although taking it with food might improve absorption.

* **Q: How should I store calcium citrate?** A: Store calcium citrate in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Follow the storage instructions on the product label.

* **Q: Is calcium citrate safe?** A: When taken as directed, calcium citrate is generally considered safe. However, excessive intake can lead to side effects, and it's crucial to follow the recommended dosage and speak to your healthcare provider if you have any concerns.

* **Q:  Can I take too much calcium citrate?** A: Yes.  Excessive intake can lead to hypercalcemia, a potentially serious condition. Always follow the recommended dosage.  High doses can also interfere with the absorption of other medications or minerals.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's close to the time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose.
