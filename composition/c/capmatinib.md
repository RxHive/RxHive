# Capmatinib

**Generic Name:** Capmatinib

**Usage:**

Capmatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used to treat certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Specifically, it's indicated for:

* **Metastatic NSCLC harboring exon 20 insertions in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene:** This is the primary and most common use.  It's for patients whose disease has progressed after or who are ineligible for platinum-based chemotherapy.

**Side Effects:**

Capmatinib, like other TKIs, can cause a range of side effects.  The most common include:

* **Diarrhea:** Often a significant side effect, requiring management with anti-diarrheal medications.
* **Nausea and Vomiting:** Can be managed with antiemetic medications.
* **Fatigue:**  A common side effect of cancer treatment.
* **Peripheral Neuropathy:** Tingling, numbness, or pain in the hands and feet.  Can range from mild to severe.
* **Increased Liver Enzymes:**  Regular blood tests are needed to monitor liver function.
* **Rash:** Can range in severity.
* **Pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs):**  A serious side effect that requires immediate medical attention.
* **Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD):**  Another serious lung complication.

**Less common but serious side effects:** include heart problems, blood clots, and eye problems.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary significantly between individuals.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

Capmatinib is a highly selective inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).  Specifically, it's designed to target EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, which are relatively uncommon but often lead to aggressive lung cancer growth. By inhibiting the abnormal EGFR activity caused by these mutations, capmatinib disrupts the cancer cell's growth and survival signals, leading to tumor shrinkage or stabilization.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is capmatinib administered?**  A: Capmatinib is taken orally as a tablet.

* **Q: How long will I need to take capmatinib?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the response to therapy and the presence of side effects.  It's typically continued as long as it's beneficial and tolerable.

* **Q: What are the potential drug interactions with capmatinib?** A:  Several potential drug interactions exist.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Q: Are there specific monitoring requirements while on capmatinib?** A: Yes, regular blood tests to monitor liver function, complete blood count (CBC), and other parameters are necessary to monitor for side effects and assess treatment response.  Imaging studies (CT scans, PET scans) are also typically done periodically.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of capmatinib?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  Do not double up on doses.

* **Q: Is capmatinib suitable for all types of lung cancer?** A: No, capmatinib is specifically indicated for metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertions.  It is not effective against other types of lung cancer or other EGFR mutations.
