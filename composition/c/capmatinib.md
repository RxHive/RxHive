# Capmatinib
### Generic Name
Capmatinib

### Usage
Capmatinib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat adult patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Specifically, it's indicated for patients whose tumors have a mutation leading to *MET* exon 14 skipping. This mutation is detectable through FDA-approved tests.  The drug's mechanism focuses on inhibiting the *MET* receptor, which plays a crucial role in the growth and spread of these specific types of cancer cells.  Currently, there are no approved uses of Capmatinib outside of this specific NSCLC indication.

### Dosage
The recommended oral dosage for adults with *MET* exon 14 skipping mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC is 400 mg twice daily (BID). Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment. However, clinically significant pharmacokinetic effects haven't been reported. Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on the severity of liver function abnormalities as determined by the treating physician.  Close monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is crucial.  Grade 3 or 4 elevation in liver enzymes may necessitate dose reduction or discontinuation.

* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustments are explicitly recommended for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) â‰¥30 mL/minute.  Guidance for patients with CrCl <30 mL/minute is not provided in the manufacturer's labeling.  Careful monitoring of renal function is advised in patients with renal impairment.


* **Adverse Reactions:** Dose reduction is possible for manageable adverse reactions. The first reduction is to 300 mg BID, and the second is to 200 mg BID. Discontinue Capmatinib permanently if the patient cannot tolerate 200 mg BID.  Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis necessitates permanent discontinuation regardless of grade.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Capmatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that selectively targets the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.  In *MET* exon 14 skipping NSCLC, this receptor is frequently overactive, promoting cancer cell growth and spread.  Capmatinib binds to the MET receptor, blocking its activity and thus hindering downstream signaling pathways essential for tumor growth. This ultimately leads to reduced cancer cell proliferation and potentially tumor shrinkage.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  There are no absolute contraindications listed in the manufacturer's labeling. However, careful consideration is needed before starting treatment in individuals with pre-existing conditions that might be exacerbated by Capmatinib's side effects.


* **Drug Interactions:**  Capmatinib's metabolism is affected by CYP3A inducers and inhibitors.  Coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors may increase Capmatinib exposure, raising the risk of adverse effects. Conversely, strong or moderate CYP3A inducers may decrease Capmatinib's effectiveness.  Interactions with other substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), MATE1, and MATE2K transporters are also possible, potentially leading to altered drug levels and increased side effects.


* **Warnings:** Capmatinib carries a risk of interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis, hepatotoxicity, and photosensitivity reactions. Patients should be closely monitored for these complications.  The drug poses a risk to a developing fetus, so it's contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.


* **Specific Populations:** Safety and efficacy haven't been established in children or pregnant/breastfeeding women.  Caution is warranted in older adults, who may be more susceptible to adverse effects.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Capmatinib with food?** A:  Capmatinib can be taken with or without food.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not attempt to make up a missed dose. Take the next scheduled dose as usual.


* **Q: How should I store Capmatinib?** A: Store Capmatinib tablets at room temperature, protected from moisture.


* **Q:  Are there any specific lab tests I need to undergo while on Capmatinib?** A: Regular monitoring of LFTs (including ALT, AST, and bilirubin) and renal function tests are typically recommended.


* **Q: What are the early warning signs I should watch for?** A: Pay close attention to any signs of shortness of breath, persistent cough, unusual fatigue, skin rashes, or changes in urine color or output. Immediately report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor.
