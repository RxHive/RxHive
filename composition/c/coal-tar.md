# Coal Tar
### Generic Name
Coal Tar

### Usage
Coal tar is a topical medication primarily used to manage skin conditions characterized by excessive skin cell turnover. Its main applications include treating dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis.  It works by slowing down the rapid growth of skin cells, reducing scaling, inflammation, and itching associated with these conditions. While primarily used for scalp conditions, coal tar can also be applied to other affected areas of the body.  The specific formulation (e.g., shampoo, cream, ointment, lotion) will guide the area of application.


### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific coal tar product, the condition being treated, and the affected area.  Always follow the instructions on your product's label.  Here are some general examples:

* **Dandruff:** Coal tar shampoos are typically used 1-2 times per week initially, then reduced to once a week or as needed, depending on response.  Leave the shampoo on for the time specified on the product label, usually 5 minutes, before rinsing thoroughly.

* **Seborrheic Dermatitis and Psoriasis:**  For these conditions, coal tar may be applied as a cream, lotion, ointment, or in a bath.  Application frequency ranges from once to several times daily, depending on severity.  For psoriasis, a product combining coal tar with salicylic acid might be used to soften thick scales before applying the coal tar.  Bath applications usually involve adding a specific amount of coal tar solution to a warm bath, soaking for a short period (5-20 minutes), and then patting the skin dry.  The exact amounts and frequency are detailed on individual product labels.

* **Pediatric Use:**  The safety and effectiveness of coal tar in children have not been established.  Do not use it on children without consulting a pediatrician.


### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Skin irritation (redness, burning, itching)
* Skin discoloration (temporary)
* Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles)
* Increased sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity)

Less common, but more serious side effects, require immediate medical attention.  Consult a healthcare provider if you experience any concerning side effects.


### How it Works
Coal tar is a complex mixture of chemicals derived from coal. Its exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work through multiple actions:

* **Keratolytic effect:** It helps to break down and soften the thickened, scaly skin common in conditions like psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis.
* **Anti-inflammatory effect:** It reduces inflammation and redness in the skin.
* **Anti-proliferative effect:** It slows down the rapid growth and turnover of skin cells, which is a key feature in these conditions.  This helps reduce scaling and itching.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Coal tar should not be used if you have a known allergy to coal tar or any of its components, or if you have active or inflamed psoriasis, weeping eczema, or widespread pustular psoriasis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Coal tar can increase photosensitivity, so avoid excessive sun exposure while using it, and be cautious when using other photosensitizing drugs concurrently. Consult your doctor or pharmacist regarding any medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of coal tar during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered after careful evaluation by a healthcare professional.  Limited evidence suggests topical application during pregnancy might be safe for treating psoriasis, but the risk-benefit should be assessed.  If used while breastfeeding, avoid direct contact between the infant and the treated skin.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.  Wash hands thoroughly after application.  Some formulations may stain clothing, hair, and fabrics.

* **Q: Can I use coal tar with other skin products?** A:  Itâ€™s best to avoid using other skincare products on treated areas, as this may interfere with the medication's effectiveness or cause further skin irritation.  Speak with your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a side effect?** A:  Stop using the product and consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.
