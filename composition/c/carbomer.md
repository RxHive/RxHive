# Carbomer
### Generic Name
Carbomer

### Usage
Carbomer is primarily used in ophthalmic (eye) formulations as a viscous gel to treat dry eye disease.  It works by forming a lubricating layer on the surface of the eye, providing relief from dryness, irritation, and discomfort associated with this condition.  While its primary use is for dry eyes, it may be a component in other eye-related products for lubrication or as a vehicle for other medications.

### Dosage
**Dry Eyes (Ophthalmic Gel):**

* **Adults and Children:** The typical dose is one drop of 2% or 0.3% carbomer gel instilled into the affected eye(s) 3-4 times daily, as needed.  Dosage may vary depending on the specific formulation and the severity of the dry eye condition.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Localized burning
* Eye irritation
* Eye redness
* Stinging of the eyes

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include:

* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Corneal injury
* Intraocular inflammation (inflammation inside the eye)
* Swelling


If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Carbomer is a high-molecular-weight polymer that acts as a lubricant and mucin adhesive.  When applied to the eye, it forms a gel-like layer on the surface of the cornea and conjunctiva. This layer helps to retain moisture, improving lubrication and reducing friction. The carbomer's mucoadhesive properties help it bind to the natural mucus layer of the eye, which enhances its ability to stay in place and provide prolonged relief.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Carbomer should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to carbomer or any of the formulation's components.
* **Interactions:** While generally well-tolerated, it's advisable to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies) you are currently using to assess potential interactions, though clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Use during pregnancy should be limited to the minimum effective dose.  Information on excretion in breast milk is lacking; therefore, caution is advised.
* **Contact Lenses:** Contact lenses should be removed before applying carbomer and should not be reinserted for at least 15 minutes after application.
* **Other Ophthalmic Medications:** Administer other eye drops at least 5 minutes before applying carbomer.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for carbomer to work?** A:  The effects of carbomer gel are generally felt relatively quickly, offering immediate lubrication and relief. The duration of this relief will vary depending on the severity of dry eye and environmental factors.

* **Q: Can I use carbomer with other eye drops?** A: Yes, but it is crucial to administer other eye medications at least 5 minutes before applying carbomer to ensure effectiveness.

* **Q: How should I store carbomer?** A: Store according to the directions on the product label. Typically, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is carbomer safe for children?** A:  Generally, carbomer is considered safe for children, with the dosage being the same as for adults. However, always consult a pediatrician before using any medication in children.
