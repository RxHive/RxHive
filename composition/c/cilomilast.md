# Cilomilast
### Generic Name
Cilomilast

### Usage
Cilomilast is primarily used for maintaining lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's specifically indicated for individuals who experience poor response to albuterol, a common bronchodilator.  While its primary use is in COPD management,  it's crucial to remember that cilomilast is *not* a bronchodilator itself and shouldn't be used to treat acute bronchospasm.  Instead, it works to reduce inflammation in the lungs, helping to improve long-term lung function and prevent further decline.

### Dosage

**Adults (COPD):** The typical dose is 15 mg twice daily (BID).  Treatment should continue even during acute COPD exacerbations.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of cilomilast in children haven't been established, and it's not recommended for pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Cilomilast should be used cautiously in patients with mild to moderate liver impairment. It's contraindicated in those with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
* **Renal Impairment:**  Use caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min).


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Dizziness
* Headaches

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects may occur.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Cilomilast is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4). PDE4 is an enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a molecule that plays a crucial role in regulating inflammation. By inhibiting PDE4, cilomilast increases cAMP levels, thus reducing inflammation in the lungs.  This anti-inflammatory effect helps improve lung function in COPD patients. Cilomilast shows a higher selectivity for PDE4D than other PDE4 subtypes.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cilomilast is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to cilomilast or any component of its formulation, moderate-to-severe liver impairment, and acute bronchospasm.
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using cilomilast in patients with mild hepatic impairment or renal impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of cilomilast during pregnancy is unknown. Breastfeeding is not recommended while using this medication because it's unclear whether cilomilast is excreted in breast milk.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions may occur.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take cilomilast with food?**

A:  Cilomilast can be taken with or without food. However, taking it with food may help minimize gastrointestinal side effects like nausea and diarrhea.

**Q: How should I store cilomilast?**

A:  Store cilomilast as directed on the product label. Typically, this involves storing it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q:  Is cilomilast a rescue medication for sudden breathing problems?**

A: No, cilomilast is not a rescue inhaler for acute bronchospasm. It is for long-term maintenance of lung function and not for immediate relief of breathing difficulties.  Contact your doctor or use your prescribed rescue medication for sudden shortness of breath.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
