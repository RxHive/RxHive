# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Pseudoephedrine
### Generic Name
Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Pseudoephedrine

### Usage

Chlorpheniramine maleate + pseudoephedrine is a combination medication used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and other upper respiratory allergies.  It's a dual-action formula addressing both the runny nose/congestion and sneezing/itching aspects of these conditions.

* **Chlorpheniramine maleate:** This is an antihistamine that works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.

* **Pseudoephedrine:** This is a decongestant that helps shrink swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness and congestion.

The primary use is symptomatic relief of cold and allergy symptoms.  While it can provide temporary relief, it does *not* treat the underlying cause of the illness or allergy.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific product formulation (tablet, capsule, liquid), age, and the severity of symptoms. Always follow the instructions provided on the product label or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.  **Never exceed the recommended dose.**

**Adults (typically 12 years and older):**  Dosage typically ranges from one to two tablets or capsules every 4-6 hours, not exceeding the maximum daily dose specified on the product label. Liquid formulations will have different dosage instructions based on the concentration.

**Children:** This combination is generally not recommended for children under 12 years old.  Always consult a pediatrician before giving any medication to a child.  Separate medications for children's colds and allergies are available, and these should be used instead.

**Oral Administration:**  This medication is typically taken orally with a glass of water.  

**IV Administration:** This combination is not administered intravenously.  Intravenous administration would require separate administration of each drug and is not a standard practice for treating cold or allergy symptoms.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Headache
* Nausea
* Difficulty sleeping
* Nervousness
* Increased heart rate
* Constipation

Less common, but potentially serious side effects:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Irregular heartbeat
* High blood pressure
* Seizures

If you experience any serious side effects, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Chlorpheniramine maleate and pseudoephedrine work synergistically to alleviate cold and allergy symptoms. Chlorpheniramine blocks histamine receptors, preventing histamine from binding and causing allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy, watery eyes.  Pseudoephedrine acts as a decongestant, narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages to reduce swelling and improve nasal airflow.  This combined action provides relief from both the allergic and congestive symptoms associated with colds and allergies.

* **Drug Interactions:** This medication may interact with other drugs, including MAO inhibitors, certain antidepressants, and other decongestants. Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are currently taking.
