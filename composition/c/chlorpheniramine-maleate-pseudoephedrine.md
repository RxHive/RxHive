# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Pseudoephedrine

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Pseudoephedrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, hay fever, and other upper respiratory allergies.  Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that reduces sneezing, runny nose, and itchy, watery eyes. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving nasal congestion.  This medication is typically used for short-term relief of symptoms.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect of chlorpheniramine.
* **Dry mouth, nose, and throat:**  This is common with both medications.
* **Headache:** Can be caused by either medication.
* **Nausea:** Less common.
* **Dizziness:**  May occur, especially with higher doses.
* **Insomnia:**  Pseudoephedrine can interfere with sleep.
* **Increased heart rate and blood pressure:** More likely with pseudoephedrine, particularly in individuals with pre-existing conditions.
* **Constipation:**  Less common.
* **Difficulty urinating:**  Less common.

Serious side effects are rare but can include allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.

**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate (Antihistamine):**  Works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine is responsible for many allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.

* **Pseudoephedrine (Decongestant):**  Shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing congestion and making it easier to breathe.  It achieves this by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors.
