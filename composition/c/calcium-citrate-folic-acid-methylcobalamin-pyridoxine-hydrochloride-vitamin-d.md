# Calcium citrate + Folic Acid + Methylcobalamin + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + Vitamin D

**Generic Name:** Calcium Citrate + Folic Acid + Methylcobalamin + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + Vitamin D (This is a combination product, so there isn't one single generic name.)

**Usage:**  This combination supplement is typically used to address deficiencies in calcium, vitamin D, folate (folic acid), vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin), and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride).  Specific uses may include:

* **Calcium and Vitamin D:**  Maintaining bone health, preventing osteoporosis, and treating or preventing hypocalcemia (low blood calcium).
* **Folic Acid:** Preventing neural tube defects during pregnancy, treating anemia due to folate deficiency.
* **Methylcobalamin (B12):** Treating pernicious anemia and other vitamin B12 deficiencies, supporting nerve function.
* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (B6):** Supporting various metabolic processes, nerve function, and red blood cell formation.  Sometimes used in combination with other B vitamins to treat certain conditions.


**Side Effects:** Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, upset stomach (especially with high doses of calcium citrate).
* **Other:**  Headache, flushing, allergic reactions (rare but possible).  High doses of certain vitamins can also lead to adverse effects.


**How it Works:** Each component in this multivitamin supplement works independently to perform its specific function:

* **Calcium Citrate:**  Provides calcium, crucial for bone health, muscle function, nerve transmission, and blood clotting. Citrate is a form of calcium that's generally better absorbed than other forms like calcium carbonate.
* **Folic Acid:**  Essential for cell growth and development, DNA synthesis, and the prevention of neural tube defects.
* **Methylcobalamin:**  A biologically active form of vitamin B12, crucial for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis.
* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride:**  A form of vitamin B6 involved in numerous metabolic processes, including protein and carbohydrate metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
* **Vitamin D:**  Essential for calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and overall well-being.  It aids in the regulation of calcium levels in the blood.


**FAQs:**

* **Who should take this supplement?** Individuals at risk of or diagnosed with deficiencies in any of the included vitamins and minerals, pregnant women (for folic acid), older adults (for calcium and vitamin D), and those with specific dietary restrictions may benefit.
