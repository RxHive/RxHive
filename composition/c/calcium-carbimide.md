# Calcium Carbimide
### Generic Name
Calcium Carbimide

### Usage
Calcium carbimide was used in the past for the treatment of chronic alcoholism.  It worked by altering the body's metabolism of alcohol, leading to unpleasant side effects if alcohol was consumed.  However, it's important to note that **calcium carbimide is no longer available on the market**.  Its use has been discontinued, and alternative treatments for alcohol dependence are now preferred.

### Dosage
Because calcium carbimide is no longer available, specific dosage information is not applicable.  Past prescribing practices varied, and details would need to be obtained from historical medical records if absolutely necessary.  It is crucial to understand that attempting to obtain and use this medication is unsafe and ineffective.

### Side Effects
Since calcium carbimide is no longer available, listing its side effects is primarily for informational purposes and should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its use.  The side effects associated with calcium carbimide were significantly related to its interaction with alcohol consumption. These included (but were not limited to):

*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Headache
*   Flushing
*   Palpitations
*   Dizziness
*   Shortness of breath
*   Hypotension (low blood pressure)

More serious side effects, though less common, were also possible.  **It's crucial to emphasize that this information is solely for historical context. Do not attempt to self-treat or obtain this medication.**


### How it Works
Calcium carbimide is a disulfiram-like medication that inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH).  ALDH is crucial in the body's breakdown of acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism.  By inhibiting ALDH, calcium carbimide causes an accumulation of acetaldehyde in the bloodstream when alcohol is consumed. This accumulation leads to unpleasant and potentially dangerous symptoms, making it a deterrent to alcohol consumption for individuals undergoing treatment for alcoholism.


### Precautions
Given that calcium carbimide is discontinued, precautions are irrelevant in a practical sense. However, historical information indicates that significant precautions existed regarding its use:

*   **Contraindicated with alcohol consumption:**  This was the primary precaution. Combining calcium carbimide with alcohol could result in severe adverse reactions.
*   **Cardiac Issues:** Individuals with pre-existing heart conditions were at increased risk of complications.
*   **Hepatic impairment:** Patients with liver problems may have experienced more severe side effects.
*   **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** The safety of calcium carbimide during pregnancy or breastfeeding was not established.

### FAQs

*   **Q: Where can I find Calcium Carbimide?** A: Calcium carbimide is no longer available commercially.  Attempting to obtain it through unofficial channels is extremely risky.

*   **Q:  Is Calcium Carbimide the same as Disulfiram?** A: While both calcium carbimide and disulfiram work by inhibiting ALDH, they are distinct medications with potentially different side effect profiles and formulations.  Disulfiram remains available under prescription, but itâ€™s crucial to remember that alcohol dependence treatment should be supervised by a healthcare provider.
