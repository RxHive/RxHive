# Calcitonin-Salmon
### Generic Name
Calcitonin-Salmon

### Usage
Calcitonin-salmon is primarily used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women who are at least five years past menopause and are unable to or choose not to use estrogen therapies.  Its mechanism of action involves preventing bone breakdown (resorption) and promoting increased bone density.  Secondary uses include treating hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) and Paget's disease of bone.  In Paget's disease, it helps to slow down the excessive bone breakdown and remodeling characteristic of the condition.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the route of administration.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage carefully.

**Adults:**

* **Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium):**  The initial subcutaneous or intramuscular (SC/IM) dose is typically 4 IU/kg every 12 hours. This may be increased to 8 IU/kg every 12 hours, with a maximum dose of 8 IU/kg every 6 hours.
* **Paget's Disease:** Treatment begins with 100 IU daily. The maintenance dose may range from 50 IU daily to 50-100 IU every 1-3 days.
* **Postmenopausal Osteoporosis:**  For women more than 5 years post-menopause, a common regimen is 100 IU every other day, usually in conjunction with calcium and vitamin D supplements.  Nasal spray formulations may also be used, with a typical dose of one spray (200 IU) daily, alternating nostrils.

**Children:**
The safety and efficacy of calcitonin-salmon in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for renal or hepatic impairment.  Always consult your physician if you have kidney or liver issues.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Frequency >10%):**

* Rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal mucous membranes)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Back pain
* Epistaxis (nosebleeds)
* Injection site reactions (if given by injection)
* Nausea
* Headache
* Flushing of the face or hands

**Rare Side Effects (<1%):**

* Abdominal pain
* Allergic reactions
* Decreased appetite
* Edema (swelling) of the feet
* Eye pain
* Fever
* Nocturia (increased nighttime urination)
* Local respiratory tract irritation (with nasal spray)
* Salty taste

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  While less frequent, serious reactions such as severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), hypocalcemia (dangerously low blood calcium) leading to tetany (muscle spasms), and increased risk of certain cancers have been reported.

**Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, immediately contact your healthcare provider.

### How it Works
Calcitonin-salmon works by inhibiting osteoclasts, the cells responsible for breaking down bone tissue.  By reducing bone resorption, it helps to maintain bone mass and prevent bone loss.  It also lowers serum calcium levels by increasing the excretion of calcium, phosphate, sodium, magnesium, and potassium through the kidneys.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Calcitonin-salmon is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to calcitonin-salmon.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including fatal anaphylaxis, are possible.
* **Hypocalcemia:** There is an increased risk of hypocalcemia, potentially causing tetany.
* **Malignancies:** An increased risk of overall malignancies has been noted.
* **Antibody Development:**  The body may develop antibodies against calcitonin-salmon, leading to treatment resistance.
* **Nasal Ulceration:** Use of the nasal spray formulation may lead to nasal ulceration.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Calcitonin-salmon is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. Its use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. Excretion into breast milk is unknown; therefore, its use during breastfeeding is not recommended.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from calcitonin-salmon treatment?**  A: The effects of calcitonin-salmon on bone density may not be immediately noticeable. Regular monitoring of bone mineral density is necessary to assess treatment efficacy.

* **Q: Can I take calcitonin-salmon with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: How should I store calcitonin-salmon?** A: Store as directed by your physician or pharmacist; generally, this involves storage at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Follow your doctor's instructions on what to do if you miss a dose.  Do not double up on doses.


* **Q: Is calcitonin-salmon safe for long-term use?** A: The long-term safety and efficacy should be discussed with your doctor. Regular monitoring is essential to evaluate the benefits and risks of continued treatment.
