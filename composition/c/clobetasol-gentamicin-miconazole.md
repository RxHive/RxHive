# Clobetasol + Gentamicin + Miconazole

**Generic Name:** Clobetasol Propionate + Gentamicin Sulfate + Miconazole Nitrate

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid, aminoglycoside antibiotic, and antifungal agent used to treat skin conditions involving bacterial and fungal infections along with inflammation.  Specific uses may include:

* **Secondary bacterial and fungal infections of inflamed skin conditions:** This is a crucial point.  It is *not* a first-line treatment for simple bacterial or fungal infections or simple inflammation. It's used when those conditions co-exist *with* inflammation. Examples could be eczema or psoriasis complicated by a bacterial and/or fungal superinfection.
* **Dermatitis with secondary infection:**  Various types of dermatitis (e.g., contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis) that have become infected.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the length of use and the area treated. Common side effects may include:

* **At the application site:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness, dryness, irritation, skin thinning,  folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles), hypertrichosis (increased hair growth), hypopigmentation (loss of skin color), striae (stretch marks).
* **Systemic side effects (less common, especially with prolonged use or large areas treated):**  These are more likely in children and with occlusion (covering the treated area).  They can include adrenal suppression (suppression of the adrenal glands' function), cataracts, glaucoma, increased blood sugar.


**How it Works:**

* **Clobetasol Propionate (Corticosteroid):** Reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response in the skin.
* **Gentamicin Sulfate (Aminoglycoside Antibiotic):** Kills bacteria by interfering with their protein synthesis. It is effective against a range of Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.
* **Miconazole Nitrate (Antifungal):** Kills fungi by disrupting their cell membranes.  It is effective against a range of dermatophytes, yeasts, and molds.

The combination of these three active ingredients allows for the simultaneous treatment of inflammation, bacterial infection, and fungal infection.
