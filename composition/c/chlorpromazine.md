# Chlorpromazine
### Generic Name
Chlorpromazine

### Usage
Chlorpromazine is a phenothiazine-type antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat schizophrenia and the manic phase of bipolar disorder.  It works by affecting the brain's neurotransmitters, primarily dopamine.  Beyond its primary uses, chlorpromazine also sees use in:

* **Severe behavioral and conduct disorders in children:**  It can help manage disruptive and aggressive behaviors in children with these conditions, though its use in this population requires careful consideration due to potential side effects.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  It's sometimes used to control severe nausea and vomiting, particularly when other treatments have failed.
* **Preoperative anxiety and restlessness:**  It can help calm patients before surgery.
* **Intractable hiccups:** It can be effective in relieving persistent, uncontrollable hiccups.
* **Tetanus:** It is used adjunctively with other treatments to manage the symptoms of tetanus.
* **Porphyria:**  It's employed in managing acute attacks of this rare genetic disorder.


It's crucial to understand that chlorpromazine is typically used *in conjunction* with other therapies, not as a standalone treatment for most conditions.

### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably based on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and their response to the medication.  A physician will determine the appropriate dose and schedule.  The information below is for general knowledge and should *not* be used to self-medicate.  **Always follow your doctor's instructions.**

**Adults:** Oral dosages for schizophrenia often start low (30-75mg/day) and gradually increase as tolerated, sometimes reaching up to 800mg/day in divided doses. Intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) administration is sometimes used in emergency situations, with doses carefully adjusted based on the patient's response.  Dosages for other conditions (hiccups, nausea, pre-operative anxiety) are significantly lower and administered as needed or according to a physician's specific directions.

**Children:**  Pediatric dosages are much lower and calculated based on weight (mg/kg).  The medication's use in children should be closely monitored by a doctor due to potential side effects.  Specific dosages vary widely depending on the condition being treated.

**Dosage forms:** Chlorpromazine is available in oral tablets, syrup (liquid), and injectable forms (IM and IV).


### Side Effects

Chlorpromazine can cause a wide range of side effects, varying in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Blurred vision
* Low blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension)
* Weight gain


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): A rare but life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and instability of the autonomic nervous system.  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.**
* Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS): These include muscle stiffness, tremors, involuntary movements, and restlessness.
* Tardive dyskinesia (TD):  A potentially irreversible movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, mouth, and tongue. This is a risk with long-term use.
* Blood disorders:  Chlorpromazine can affect blood cell counts, potentially leading to serious complications.
* Liver problems:  Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) can occur in rare cases.
* Photosensitivity:  Increased sensitivity to sunlight.


This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Chlorpromazine is a dopamine receptor antagonist. This means it blocks the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, movement, and thought processes.  By reducing dopamine activity in specific areas of the brain, chlorpromazine helps alleviate the symptoms of psychosis and mania.  It also affects other neurotransmitters, contributing to its various effects on the body.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Do not use chlorpromazine if you are allergic to it or other phenothiazines.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Chlorpromazine is a Category C drug during pregnancy.  It's generally avoided during pregnancy unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. It's also excreted in breast milk, making breastfeeding inadvisable while taking chlorpromazine.
* **Drug interactions:** Chlorpromazine can interact with many other medications, including antidepressants, blood pressure medications, and other CNS depressants.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Elderly patients with dementia:** Increased mortality risk has been associated with the use of antipsychotics in elderly patients with dementia. Chlorpromazine is not approved for this use.
* **Driving and operating machinery:**  Drowsiness is a common side effect, so avoid tasks requiring alertness until you know how the medication affects you.
* **Alcohol and other CNS depressants:** Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants while taking chlorpromazine, as this can increase the risk of sedation and other adverse effects.
* **Heat exposure:**  Chlorpromazine can impair the body's ability to regulate temperature, increasing the risk of heatstroke.
* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Chlorpromazine can cause constipation and other gastrointestinal problems.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking chlorpromazine suddenly?** A: No, always stop taking chlorpromazine gradually, as directed by your physician.  Sudden cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.
* **Q: How should I store chlorpromazine?** A: Store chlorpromazine at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: Is chlorpromazine addictive?** A: Physical dependence is unlikely, but tolerance can develop, requiring dose adjustments.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking chlorpromazine?** A: No.  Alcohol can significantly worsen the side effects of chlorpromazine.
