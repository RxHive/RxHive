# Chlorpromazine

**Generic Name:** Chlorpromazine

**Usage:**

Chlorpromazine is a phenothiazine antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat:

* **Schizophrenia:**  It helps manage positive symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. It can also help with negative symptoms like flat affect and social withdrawal, though less effectively than some newer antipsychotics.
* **Acute psychosis:**  This includes psychotic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, severe depression, or other conditions.
* **Severe agitation and anxiety:**  It can be used short-term to manage severe agitation and anxiety, especially in situations where other medications haven't been effective or are not suitable.
* **Nausea and vomiting (antiemetic):**  Although less common now due to the availability of safer alternatives, it can be used to control severe nausea and vomiting, particularly those associated with surgery or chemotherapy.


**Side Effects:**

Chlorpromazine can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and others rare but serious.  These include:

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision, weight gain, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight).
* **Neurological:** Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as Parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, slow movement), akathisia (restlessness), dystonia (muscle spasms), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements, often irreversible), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS - a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status).
* **Cardiovascular:** Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing), tachycardia (rapid heart rate).
* **Endocrine:** Hyperprolactinemia (increased levels of prolactin, leading to breast enlargement, galactorrhea (breast milk production), menstrual irregularities).
* **Other:** Sedation, jaundice, blood disorders, skin reactions.


**How it Works:**

Chlorpromazine primarily works by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in several brain functions, including movement, emotion, and cognition. By blocking dopamine receptors, chlorpromazine reduces the activity of dopamine, which helps alleviate psychotic symptoms. It also affects other neurotransmitters, including serotonin and norepinephrine, contributing to its effects.


**FAQs:**

* **Is chlorpromazine addictive?**  Chlorpromazine is not considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids or stimulants. However, tolerance can develop, meaning higher doses may be needed over time to achieve the same effect.  Stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The effects of chlorpromazine can vary, but noticeable improvements in symptoms may take several weeks.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking chlorpromazine?**  Alcohol should be avoided while taking chlorpromazine as it can potentiate the sedative effects and increase the risk of side effects.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Can I take chlorpromazine during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  The use of chlorpromazine during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with a doctor due to potential risks to the developing fetus or infant.
* **Who shouldn't take chlorpromazine?**  Individuals with certain medical conditions, such as severe heart problems, liver disease, or a history of certain blood disorders, should not take chlorpromazine.  It should also be avoided in those with a known hypersensitivity to phenothiazines.
