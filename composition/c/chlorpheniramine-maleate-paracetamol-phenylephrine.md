# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, flu, or other upper respiratory allergies.  It's often used for symptoms like:

* **Runny nose:** Phenylephrine acts as a decongestant, helping to shrink swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages.
* **Congestion:**  Phenylephrine addresses nasal congestion.
* **Sneezing:** Chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine that helps reduce sneezing and other allergy symptoms.
* **Headache:** Paracetamol (acetaminophen) reduces fever and pain, including headache associated with cold and flu.
* **Fever:** Paracetamol reduces fever.
* **Body aches:** Paracetamol reduces aches and pains.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a common side effect of chlorpheniramine.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth:**  A common side effect of antihistamines and decongestants.
* **Nausea:** Less common but possible.
* **Constipation:**  Less common but possible.
* **Dizziness:**  Less common but possible.
* **Insomnia:**  Especially if taken later in the day.
* **Increased heart rate:**  Less common, but a possibility with phenylephrine.
* **High blood pressure:**  A potential side effect, particularly for those with pre-existing hypertension.  Consult a doctor if you have high blood pressure.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, or swelling can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if this happens.


**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate (antihistamine):** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This helps reduce sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.
* **Paracetamol (acetaminophen) (analgesic and antipyretic):** Reduces fever by affecting the area of the brain that regulates temperature. It also reduces pain by interfering with the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that sensitize nerve endings to pain.
* **Phenylephrine (decongestant):** Narrows blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
