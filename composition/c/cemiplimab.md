# Cemiplimab
### Generic Name
Cemiplimab

### Usage

Cemiplimab is a type of immunotherapy medication, specifically a programmed death-receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitor.  Its primary use is in treating certain types of advanced skin cancer and lung cancer.

* **Metastatic cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (CSCC) and locally advanced CSCC:** Cemiplimab is used for patients who are not suitable candidates for surgery or radiation therapy.

* **Locally advanced basal-cell carcinoma (laBCC):** It's indicated for patients who have previously received treatment with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor or for whom such treatment is inappropriate.

* **First-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):**  Cemiplimab is used in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors show high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score â‰¥50%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, and who do not have EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 genetic abnormalities.


### Dosage

The standard dosage for adults across the approved indications (CSCC, laBCC, and NSCLC) is an intravenous infusion of 350 mg every three weeks until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.  The infusion is administered over 30 minutes.  

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of cemiplimab in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are not routinely made based on mild or moderate hepatic or renal impairment.  However, specific adjustments may be necessary based on the severity of side effects like liver or kidney damage, as outlined in the prescribing information.  The drug should be withheld or stopped permanently if certain side effects occur and do not respond to treatment.  Consult the prescribing information for precise guidelines on managing adverse events.

### How it Works

Cemiplimab works by blocking the programmed death-1 (PD-1) protein on the surface of immune cells (T cells).  Cancer cells often use PD-1 to evade detection and destruction by the immune system.  By blocking PD-1, cemiplimab helps restore the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Cemiplimab is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* **Immune-mediated adverse reactions:** Cemiplimab can cause severe and potentially life-threatening immune-mediated side effects affecting various organs.  Close monitoring is crucial.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Cemiplimab is harmful to a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and for at least four months after treatment.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for at least four months after the final dose.
* **Interactions:**  While not extensively documented, there's a possibility of interactions with other medications. Inform your doctor of all medications being taken.
* **Other Precautions:** Certain pre-existing conditions may require caution or adjustment of the dosage. This should always be discussed with your doctor or healthcare provider before starting cemiplimab.
