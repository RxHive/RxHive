# Calcium Fructoborate
### Generic Name
Calcium Fructoborate

### Usage
Calcium fructoborate is a nutritional supplement primarily used to improve calcium levels and support bone health.  Its unique formulation, combining calcium with fructoborate, aims to enhance calcium absorption and bioavailability.  While research is ongoing, some studies suggest it may also possess anti-inflammatory properties, potentially beneficial for joint health.  It's important to note that calcium fructoborate is not a replacement for prescribed medications for bone conditions or inflammatory diseases.  Its primary role is as a supplemental source of calcium and boron.

### Dosage
Dosage recommendations for calcium fructoborate can vary depending on the specific product and individual needs.  Always follow the instructions provided on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.  Generally, the recommended dosage is tailored to an individual's calcium requirements, considering factors such as age, overall health, and dietary intake.  Different formulations (e.g., tablets, capsules) may have different dosage strengths.  It's crucial to consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting any new supplement, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.

### Side Effects
While generally considered safe when taken as directed, calcium fructoborate may cause some side effects in certain individuals.  These are typically mild and include:

* Gastrointestinal upset (e.g., mild nausea, stomach discomfort)
* Constipation
* Diarrhea

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention.  These should be reported to your doctor without delay.  Consult a healthcare professional if you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects.

### How it Works
Calcium fructoborate works by providing a readily absorbable form of calcium and boron.  The fructoborate complex is believed to enhance calcium absorption compared to other calcium salts.  This improved absorption contributes to maintaining adequate calcium levels in the body, which is essential for bone health and various other bodily functions.  The role of boron in this supplement is less clearly defined, though some studies suggest it may support bone health and potentially have anti-inflammatory effects, influencing cytokine production and inflammation-related pathways. Further research is needed to fully understand its precise mechanism of action.
