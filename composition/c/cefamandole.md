# Cefamandole
### Generic Name
Cefamandole

### Usage
Cefamandole is a broad-spectrum, second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections.  Its primary use is in treating serious bacterial infections affecting different parts of the body.  These include:

* **Respiratory infections:**  Such as pneumonia and bronchitis, particularly when caused by susceptible bacteria.
* **Genitourinary infections:**  Including infections of the urinary tract and reproductive organs.
* **Skin and soft tissue infections:**  Like cellulitis, abscesses, and wound infections.
* **Bone and joint infections:**  Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis are examples.
* **Septicemia (bloodstream infection):** A severe and life-threatening condition.
* **Peritonitis:**  Inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity.

Cefamandole is also used for surgical prophylaxis, meaning it helps prevent infections from developing after surgery.  This is particularly relevant for procedures with a high risk of infection.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The dosage of Cefamandole varies depending on the severity and type of infection, as well as the route of administration (intramuscular [IM] or intravenous [IV]).  Typical dosage ranges from 0.5g to 2g every 4-8 hours for treating infections. For surgical prophylaxis, a dose of 1-2g is given 30-60 minutes before surgery, followed by repeat doses every 6 hours for 24-48 hours (or up to 72 hours for procedures involving prosthetic devices).  IV administration should be slow (over 3-5 minutes) or as an intermittent or continuous infusion.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Cefamandole's safety hasn't been established in infants under one month old. For children over one month, the dosage is typically 50-100 mg/kg/day divided into multiple doses.  In severe infections, higher doses (up to 150 mg/kg/day) may be used.  Surgical prophylaxis dosages for children over 3 months old follow a similar pattern as adults, adjusted for weight.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (renal impairment).  The adjustments are based on creatinine clearance (CrCl) levels, and a healthcare professional should determine the appropriate reduced dose.  The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dose adjustments for liver impairment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Pain at the injection site (for IM administration)
* Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein, for IV administration)


Less common, but more serious side effects, can include:

* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage)
* Convulsions (seizures)
* Central nervous system toxicity
* Pseudomembranous colitis (a severe intestinal infection)
* Hepatic dysfunction (liver problems)
* Hematologic disorders (blood disorders)
* Superinfection (new infections developing due to disruption of normal flora)


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Cefamandole is a bactericidal antibiotic, meaning it kills bacteria. It achieves this by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  Specifically, it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) within the bacterial cell wall, preventing the final stages of cell wall construction. This leads to cell lysis (breakdown) and ultimately bacterial death.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Cefamandole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to cefamandole or other cephalosporin antibiotics.

* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with a history of penicillin allergy (cross-reactivity is possible), renal impairment, porphyria, or gastrointestinal disease (especially colitis).

* **Drug Interactions:**  Cefamandole can interact with several medications.  It can produce a disulfiram-like reaction (similar to Antabuse) with alcohol consumption. Probenecid can increase Cefamandole's blood levels, while sodium picosulfate’s effect may be diminished. Cefamandole can also potentiate the effects of vitamin K antagonists (blood thinners).  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Cefamandole is categorized as pregnancy category B.  It is excreted in breast milk and should be used cautiously during breastfeeding.

* **General Considerations:** For intramuscular injections, inject deep into a large muscle mass.  Cefamandole may cause bleeding, which can be reversed with vitamin K. Avoid alcohol consumption while taking Cefamandole.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Cefamandole?**  A: Store as directed by your pharmacist, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I take Cefamandole with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking before starting Cefamandole to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How long will it take for Cefamandole to work?** A:  The time it takes to feel relief from symptoms depends on the infection’s severity and your overall health.  You should start to feel better within a few days, but it's vital to complete the full course of treatment as prescribed.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking Cefamandole when I feel better?** A: No, stopping the medication prematurely can lead to treatment failure and the potential for the infection to return, possibly more resistant to treatment.  Always complete the prescribed course.
