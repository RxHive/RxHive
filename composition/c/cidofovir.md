# Cidofovir
### Generic Name
Cidofovir

### Usage

Cidofovir is primarily used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS.  CMV retinitis is a serious eye infection that can lead to blindness. Cidofovir is a powerful antiviral medication that specifically targets and inhibits the replication of the CMV virus.  It's important to note that Cidofovir is not a first-line treatment for CMV retinitis; other medications are typically tried first.  However, it becomes a crucial option when other treatments prove ineffective or when the infection is severe.

Beyond its primary use, Cidofovir has also shown some efficacy in treating other viral infections, though this is often considered "off-label" use, meaning it's not officially approved for these conditions by regulatory bodies. These off-label uses include certain adenovirus infections and acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus infections.  The use of Cidofovir for these off-label indications should always be under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional who carefully weighs the potential benefits against the risks.


### Dosage

Dosage of Cidofovir varies greatly depending on the specific infection being treated, the route of administration (intravenous or topical), and the patient's renal function.  **It's crucial to emphasize that the information below is for general knowledge and should not be interpreted as a prescription.**  Always follow the instructions provided by a healthcare professional.

**Adult Dosage (Intravenous):**

* **CMV infection:** The initial dose is typically 5 mg/kg administered intravenously once a week for two consecutive weeks.  This is often followed by a maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg every two weeks.  
* **Adenovirus infection (off-label):**  Dosing strategies vary, ranging from 5 mg/kg once weekly to 1 mg/kg three times weekly.
* **Acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus (off-label):** Dosing regimens are also variable, generally involving weekly or bi-weekly administrations.

**Important Considerations for IV Administration:** To minimize the risk of kidney damage (nephrotoxicity), Cidofovir is usually given with probenecid and preceded by a large volume of intravenous saline (IV fluids).  This helps to flush the kidneys and reduce the drug's impact.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Cidofovir in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children unless specifically directed by a specialist and in controlled clinical settings.

**Topical Dosage (for mucocutaneous herpes simplex):**  A 1% Cidofovir gel, compounded by a pharmacy, can be applied once daily for five days.


### Side Effects

Cidofovir can cause various side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  The severity and frequency of these side effects can vary from person to person.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Fatigue


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage): This is a major concern and can lead to kidney failure.
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count): This increases the risk of infection.
* Fanconi syndrome (a kidney disorder affecting the tubules)
*  Metabolic acidosis (build-up of acid in the body)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)

**If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persist, consult your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

Cidofovir is a nucleotide analog.  Once inside cells, it's converted into its active form (cidofovir diphosphate). This active metabolite interferes with the replication of DNA viruses, like CMV, by directly inhibiting DNA polymerase, an enzyme essential for viral DNA replication.  Essentially, it tricks the virus into incorporating cidofovir diphosphate into its own genetic material, halting further replication and thus suppressing the viral infection.


### Precautions

* **Kidney function:** Cidofovir is highly nephrotoxic (harmful to the kidneys).  Kidney function must be closely monitored before, during, and after treatment.  Pre-existing kidney disease is a contraindication for Cidofovir use.
* **Other nephrotoxic drugs:**  Avoid using Cidofovir concurrently with other drugs that can harm the kidneys (e.g., aminoglycosides, NSAIDs).
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Cidofovir is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its potential risks to the fetus are unknown.  It's not recommended during pregnancy unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Breastfeeding is also discouraged due to the potential for the drug to pass into breast milk.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Individuals with a known allergy to Cidofovir or probenecid should avoid using this medication.
* **Children:** The safety and efficacy in children haven't been established.
* **Neutropenia:** Cidofovir can cause a reduction in neutrophils (a type of white blood cell), increasing the risk of infection.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Cidofovir to work?**  A: The time it takes for Cidofovir to become effective varies.  Improvement in CMV retinitis might be observed within weeks, but sustained treatment is usually required.
* **Q: How is Cidofovir stored?** A: Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist. Generally, medications should be kept at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Cidofovir?** A: Discuss this with your doctor. Alcohol can interact with medications and potentially worsen side effects.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Cidofovir if I feel better?** A: No, you should continue treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better. Stopping early can lead to recurrence of the infection.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.  Never double up on a dose without professional guidance.
