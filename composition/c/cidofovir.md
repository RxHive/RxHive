# Cidofovir

**Generic Name:** Cidofovir

**Usage:** Cidofovir is an antiviral medication used to treat certain serious viral infections, primarily:

* **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis:** A serious eye infection common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS.
* **CMV infections in immunocompromised patients:**  Can affect other organs besides the eyes, though retinitis is the most common indication.

Cidofovir is typically used when other antiviral treatments have failed or are unsuitable.  It's often administered intravenously (IV) in a hospital setting due to the potential for serious side effects.


**Side Effects:** Cidofovir can cause a range of side effects, some of which can be severe.  These include:

* **Kidney problems (nephrotoxicity):** This is the most common and serious side effect.  It can range from mild elevations in creatinine levels to acute kidney failure.  Prophylactic hydration and probenecid are often used to mitigate this risk.
* **Low white blood cell count (leukopenia):**  Increases the risk of infection.
* **Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia):** Increases the risk of bleeding.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Common gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Diarrhea:**  Common gastrointestinal side effect.
* **Elevated liver enzymes:**  Indicating potential liver damage.
* **Headache:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Muscle pain (myalgia):**


**How it Works:** Cidofovir is a nucleotide analog antiviral. This means it resembles a building block of DNA and RNA.  It interferes with the replication of DNA viruses, specifically CMV, by incorporating itself into the viral DNA. This prevents the virus from making copies of itself, thereby halting or slowing its spread.


**FAQs:**

* **Is cidofovir a first-line treatment for CMV infections?** No, it's usually reserved for treating serious CMV infections that don't respond to other antiviral medications (like ganciclovir or valganciclovir), or for situations where those medications are contraindicated.

* **How is cidofovir administered?** Typically intravenously (IV) in a clinical setting due to the risk of kidney damage.

* **What are the precautions before using cidofovir?**  Kidney function tests are essential before and during treatment.  Patients often receive hydration and probenecid to help protect their kidneys.  Blood counts should also be monitored regularly.

* **Are there any drug interactions?** Yes, cidofovir can interact with other medications, particularly those that affect kidney function. It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

* **What are the long-term effects of cidofovir?** Long-term use can increase the risk of cumulative kidney damage.  Regular monitoring of kidney function is vital.
