# Cisatracurium
### Generic Name
Cisatracurium

### Usage
Cisatracurium is a neuromuscular-blocking drug used as an adjunct to general anesthesia.  Its primary use is to facilitate tracheal intubation (insertion of a breathing tube) in adults and children (1 month to 12 years).  It also provides skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery in adults and children (2-12 years) and aids in mechanical ventilation, particularly in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients, especially those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  Note that some uses, like preventing ventilator asynchrony in ARDS patients, are considered off-label.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Cisatracurium dosages are highly individualized due to patient variability.  Adequate pain control and sedation are crucial before and during administration.

**Adults:**

* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Paralysis:**
    * **Facilitating Mechanical Ventilation in ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 150) or Relieving Shivering from Therapeutic Hypothermia (up to 48 hours):**  0.1-0.2 mg/kg loading dose IV, immediately followed by an infusion of 1-3 mcg/kg/min (0.06-0.18 mg/kg/h).  Adjust the rate as needed.
    * **Preventing Ventilator Asynchrony in ARDS (off-label):** Non-weight-based regimen: 15 mg loading dose IV, followed by 37.5 mg/h for 48 hours.  Rapid boluses of 20 mg may be given during infusion if needed (e.g., if end-inspiratory plateau pressure remains >32 cm H2O).  Dosage range: 0.5-10 mcg/kg/min (0.03-0.6 mg/kg/h).

* **Neuromuscular Blockade for Intubation, Surgery, or Mechanical Ventilation (adjunct to general anesthesia):**
    * **Intubating Dose:** 0.15-0.2 mg/kg bolus IV.  Higher doses (up to 0.4 mg/kg) may be used. In patients with neuromuscular diseases (myasthenia gravis, etc.), the maximum initial bolus is 0.02 mg/kg. After succinylcholine for intubation, the initial dose is 0.1 mg/kg.
    * **Maintenance Dose:**
        * **Intermittent Bolus:** 0.03 mg/kg every 40-50 minutes (after 0.15 mg/kg initial dose) or 60 minutes (after 0.2 mg/kg initial dose), as needed.
        * **Continuous Infusion:** Start with 3 mcg/kg/min (0.18 mg/kg/h) to rapidly counteract recovery. Reduce to 1-2 mcg/kg/min (0.06-0.12 mg/kg/h) for maintenance.  Reduce infusion rate by 30-40% with stable inhalational anesthesia (isoflurane, enflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane).

**Pediatric (Neuromuscular Blockade):**

* **Infants and Children <2 years:** 0.15 mg/kg IV intermittent dose over 5-10 seconds.
* **Children ≥2 years and Adolescents:** 0.1-0.15 mg/kg IV intermittent dose over 5-10 seconds, or continuous infusion starting with 0.15-0.2 mg/kg IV bolus, followed by 3 mcg/kg/min infusion, titrated down to 1-2 mcg/kg/min based on response.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the labeling for hepatic or renal impairment, but longer half-lives of metabolites are seen in these conditions requiring careful monitoring.  For obese patients, use ideal body weight (IBW) for weight-based calculations.  In extremely obese patients (BMI ≥50 kg/m²), consider using 40% adjusted body weight (AdjBW) calculation (expert opinion), where AdjBW = [0.4 × (total body weight - IBW) + IBW].  Titrate to clinical effect after the initial dose.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are rare but may include bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), and flushing.  

Less common, but serious side effects, especially with prolonged use, include bronchospasm, muscle calcification, and myopathy (including acute quadriplegic syndrome).  Pruritus (itching) and skin rash have also been reported.  Any adverse effect necessitates immediate consultation with a healthcare provider.


### How it Works
Cisatracurium works by competitively binding to acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This prevents acetylcholine from binding, blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles, resulting in muscle relaxation.  It's a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, meaning it doesn't initially cause muscle contractions like depolarizing agents.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to cisatracurium or any formulation component; use of 10 mL multiple-dose vials in neonates <1 month and low-birth-weight infants (benzyl alcohol content).

**Increased Risk:** Anaphylaxis, bradycardia, residual paralysis.

**Use with Caution:** In elderly patients and those with prior anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blockers.

**Drug Interactions:**  Cisatracurium can interact with numerous drugs, including cardiac glycosides, corticosteroids, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, inhalational anesthetics, and many others.  Consult a comprehensive drug interaction database before co-administering cisatracurium with other medications.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Cisatracurium is categorized as pregnancy category B (animal studies show no risk, but human studies are lacking). Excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Cisatracurium administered?** A:  Cisatracurium is administered intravenously (IV) only.  Do not administer intramuscularly.  Bolus doses are given undiluted over 5-10 seconds; continuous infusions require an infusion pump.

* **Q: How long does the effect of Cisatracurium last?** A: The duration depends on the dose, infusion rate, and patient factors. It can range from minutes to hours.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop administration immediately and contact your doctor or healthcare provider.

* **Q: How is Cisatracurium stored?** A: Follow the manufacturer's storage instructions carefully.

* **Q: Is Cisatracurium safe for children?** A: Cisatracurium can be used in children, but only under close medical supervision and with appropriate dosage adjustments.

* **Q:  What monitoring is needed during Cisatracurium administration?** A:  Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate) and the degree of muscle paralysis (using a peripheral nerve stimulator and clinical assessment) are essential.  Monitor for prolonged paralysis and myopathy, especially in patients on long-term therapy.
