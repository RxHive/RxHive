# Cerliponase alfa
### Generic Name
Cerliponase alfa

### Usage
Cerliponase alfa is a medication used to treat late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2 disease), also known as tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) deficiency.  This is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects children.  The primary use of cerliponase alfa is to slow the loss of the ability to walk (ambulation) in symptomatic children aged 3 years and older with CLN2 disease.  Currently, it does not treat other symptoms associated with the condition.

### Dosage
Cerliponase alfa is administered intravenously (IV) into the ventricles of the brain (intraventricularly).  The standard dosage for children aged 3 years and older is 300 mg (10 mL) given once every other week.  This requires a surgically implanted device to deliver the medication directly into the brain.  The first dose is given 5-7 days after the device is implanted.  The medication is administered over 4.5 hours alongside intraventricular electrolytes included in the administration kit.  A pre-treatment with antihistamines, with or without antipyretics or corticosteroids, 30-60 minutes before infusion is recommended.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10%):

* ECG abnormalities
* Abnormal proteins in cerebrospinal fluid
* Seizures
* Abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (pleocytosis)
* Headache
* Irritability
* Vomiting
* Hematoma
* Hypersensitivity reactions (including pyrexia with vomiting, pleocytosis, and irritability)
* Antibody development
* Fever

Less common side effects (1-10%):

* Bradycardia
* Hypotension
* Jitteriness
* Catheter infection

Rare side effects (<1%):

* Hypoxia

**Important:**  Any adverse effects, especially serious ones, should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Cerliponase alfa is a proenzyme that, once activated, breaks down proteins in the lysosomes (cellular compartments involved in waste removal).  In CLN2 disease, a buildup of these proteins causes damage to the brain and nervous system.  By breaking down these proteins, cerliponase alfa helps slow the progression of the disease and delays the loss of ambulation.

### Precautions
Cerliponase alfa is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to cerliponase alfa or its components
* Acute intraventricular access device complications (leakage, failure, infection)
* Ventriculoperitoneal shunts
* Acute, unresolved localized infection near the device insertion site
* Suspected or confirmed CNS infection

Increased risk of side effects exists in patients with:

* History of bradycardia, conduction disorder, or structural heart disease.

Caution is advised in using this drug with other medications. Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new medication while on cerliponase alfa.  The safety of cerliponase alfa during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.  Use caution if using this medicine during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is cerliponase alfa stored?**  A: Cerliponase alfa should be stored upright in a freezer at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F) in its original carton, protected from light. Thawed vials can be stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 24 hours. Do not shake, refreeze, dilute, or mix with other drugs.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss rescheduling your dose.  Do not attempt to adjust the dosage yourself.

* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects?** A: Long-term effects are still being studied. Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is essential to assess the patient's response to treatment and manage any potential side effects.

* **Q: Who should not use cerliponase alfa?** A: Individuals with hypersensitivity to cerliponase alfa or its components, acute intraventricular device complications, ventriculoperitoneal shunts, or active CNS infections should not use this medication.

* **Q: What monitoring is needed while on this medication?** A: Regular monitoring of vital signs, skin integrity, device function, cerebrospinal fluid samples, and ECG are crucial.  Your healthcare professional will determine the appropriate frequency of monitoring.
