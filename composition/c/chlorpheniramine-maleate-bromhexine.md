# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Bromhexine

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Bromhexine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory illnesses.  Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that reduces runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes. Bromhexine is an expectorant that helps loosen mucus and makes it easier to cough up.  Therefore, this combination targets both the watery, runny symptoms and the congestion associated with these illnesses.  It's typically used for short-term relief of symptoms.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect of chlorpheniramine maleate.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth:** This is another common side effect.
* **Constipation:**  Increased fluid intake can help mitigate this.
* **Nausea:** Less common, but possible.
* **Dizziness:** Especially in older adults.
* **Headache:**  Occasional.
* **Insomnia:**  More likely if taken late in the day.
* **Heart palpitations:** Rare, but seek medical attention if this occurs.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, a serious allergic reaction (such as hives, swelling, difficulty breathing) is possible and requires immediate medical attention.

**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine.  Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction or illness. It causes symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes. Chlorpheniramine blocks the action of histamine, reducing these symptoms.

* **Bromhexine:** This is an expectorant. It works by thinning and loosening mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up phlegm and clear the airways.
