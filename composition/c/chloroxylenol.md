# Chloroxylenol
### Generic Name
Chloroxylenol

### Usage
Chloroxylenol, also known as para-chloro-meta-xylenol (PCMX), is primarily used as an antiseptic and disinfectant. Its main application is in topical disinfection of the skin, preparing it for procedures like injections or minor surgery.  It's also used in cleaning surgical instruments.  Furthermore, chloroxylenol finds its place in various household disinfectants and wound cleaning products.


### Dosage
**Antisepsis (Topical Application):**

* **Adult and Pediatric:**  A 4.8% solution is typically used.  The recommended dilution is 1 tablespoon (15 mL) in 10 ounces (300 mL) of water.  Apply the diluted solution to the affected area and cover with a gauze or bandage.  

**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specified in manufacturer's labeling.  Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance, especially in cases of impaired organ function.


### Side Effects
* Irritation and redness at the application site are possible.

While rare, serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning reaction after using chloroxylenol, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Chloroxylenol is a phenolic antiseptic.  Its mechanism involves binding to proteins within bacterial cell membranes, disrupting the membrane's integrity. This disruption causes leakage of the cell's contents.  Chloroxylenol then enters the bacterial cell, further binding to proteins and enzymes to inhibit their function, leading to bacterial cell death. At high concentrations, chloroxylenol can coagulate proteins and nucleic acids, causing rapid cell death.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Chloroxylenol is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the substance.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Chloroxylenol is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, use during breastfeeding should be approached cautiously and under medical supervision.
* **General Use:** This preparation is for external use only. Avoid contact with eyes and extensive application to large areas of the body.
