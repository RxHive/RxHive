# Cabazitaxel
### Generic Name
Cabazitaxel

### Usage
Cabazitaxel is primarily used in combination with prednisone to treat patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer.  This means it's used for prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and no longer responds to hormone therapy.  It's specifically indicated for patients who have already received treatment with a docetaxel-containing regimen.  There are currently no other primary uses approved.

### Dosage
Cabazitaxel is administered intravenously (IV) over one hour.  The typical dosage for adults with metastatic prostate cancer is 20 mg/m² once every three weeks, given in combination with oral prednisone at 10 mg/day.  In certain patients, and at the discretion of their healthcare provider, a higher dose of 25 mg/m² every three weeks may be used, again with concurrent prednisone.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Premedication:**  Approximately 30 minutes before each Cabazitaxel dose, premedication with an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine IV 25mg or equivalent), a corticosteroid (e.g., dexamethasone 8mg IV or equivalent), and an H2 antagonist is recommended. Antiemetic prophylaxis (oral or IV) is also advised to prevent nausea and vomiting.
* **Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary based on factors such as hepatic (liver) and renal (kidney) function.  Specific adjustments are detailed below.  Patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times the upper limit of normal) should not use Cabazitaxel.  In patients with mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment, reduced doses and close monitoring are crucial.  Obesity also requires careful consideration, often using actual body weight for dosage calculation as per ASCO guidelines.
* **Toxicity Management:** Dose reductions are implemented based on the severity of side effects. Specific guidelines for managing hematologic (blood cell-related) and non-hematologic toxicities are available from a healthcare professional.
* **Pediatric Use:**  The safety and efficacy of Cabazitaxel in children have not been established.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Fatigue
* Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, or pain in the extremities)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite
* Anemia
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count – a type of white blood cell)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Weakness
* Back pain
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Cough
* Fever


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less frequent):**

* Severe hypersensitivity reactions (requiring immediate discontinuation of the infusion)
* Febrile neutropenia (fever with low neutrophil count)
* Neutropenic infection
* Hemorrhagic cystitis (bleeding in the bladder)
* Pulmonary symptoms (new or worsening, potentially indicating interstitial lung disease or other serious conditions)
* Renal failure
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Cabazitaxel is a taxane derivative and a microtubule inhibitor.  Microtubules are essential components of cells, involved in cell division and other crucial processes. Cabazitaxel binds to tubulin, a protein that forms microtubules. This binding promotes microtubule assembly and inhibits their disassembly, ultimately stabilizing the microtubules.  This process disrupts cell division, leading to cell death, particularly in cancer cells, and inhibiting tumor growth.  Unlike other taxanes, Cabazitaxel has low affinity for multidrug resistance proteins, making it effective even in some tumors resistant to other similar drugs.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Severe hypersensitivity to Cabazitaxel or any component of the formulation, including polysorbate 80.
* Neutrophil count ≤1500/mm³.
* Severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin concentration >3 times ULN).
* Concomitant yellow fever vaccination.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Bone Marrow Suppression:**  Cabazitaxel can significantly suppress bone marrow function, leading to neutropenia. Close monitoring of blood cell counts is crucial.  Filgrastim (a medication to stimulate white blood cell production) is often recommended as primary prophylaxis in high-risk patients.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Severe hypersensitivity reactions can occur.  Premedication is essential, and the infusion should be stopped immediately if a reaction occurs.
* **Gastrointestinal Toxicity:** Cabazitaxel can cause significant gastrointestinal side effects. Close monitoring and supportive care are necessary, especially in patients at increased risk (e.g., elderly, those with prior pelvic radiation).
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Cabazitaxel should be used cautiously in patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment, with appropriate dose adjustments.
* **Pulmonary Toxicity:**  Monitor for any new or worsening pulmonary symptoms.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Cabazitaxel can interact with other medications, particularly strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Cabazitaxel is categorized as pregnancy category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus. Effective contraception should be used during treatment and for three months after the last dose.  It's unknown if Cabazitaxel is excreted in breast milk.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Cabazitaxel stored?** A: Follow your pharmacist's instructions carefully.  Specific storage conditions vary depending on the preparation and dosage form.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The response to Cabazitaxel varies among individuals, and it's crucial to work closely with your healthcare provider to assess treatment efficacy.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss a plan.  Do not attempt to adjust the dosage on your own.
* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking Cabazitaxel?** A: Discuss any dietary concerns with your healthcare provider.  Maintaining adequate hydration is vital, especially considering the risk of diarrhea.
* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while on Cabazitaxel?** A:  Fatigue and neuropathy are common side effects that could affect your ability to safely drive or operate machinery. Follow your healthcare provider's guidance.
