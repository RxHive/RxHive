# Chloramphenicol (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Chloramphenicol (Systemic)

### Usage
Chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.  Its primary use is in treating serious bacterial infections where other, less toxic antibiotics are ineffective or contraindicated.  Specific indications include:

*   **Bacterial Meningitis:**  A serious infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
*   **Bacteremia:**  The presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. This is particularly relevant when caused by bacteria like *Chlamydiaceae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Rickettsia*, and *Salmonella* species (in acute infections).
*   **Cystic Fibrosis Exacerbations:**  Worsening of symptoms in individuals with cystic fibrosis, often due to bacterial lung infections.


Chloramphenicol is reserved for severe infections due to its potential for serious side effects. It's not suitable for treating minor infections like colds or the flu.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the severity of the infection, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (intravenous or oral).  Always follow a healthcare provider's instructions precisely.  The information below is for general understanding and should not replace professional medical advice.

**Adults:** For serious infections, the typical dose is 50-100 mg/kg/day, administered intravenously (IV) or orally in divided doses every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose is usually 4 g/day.

**Children:** Dosage for children is also calculated based on weight and the severity of the infection.  For meningitis and pneumococcal infections, intravenous doses of 18.75-25 mg/kg every 6 hours are common, with a maximum daily dose of 4 g/day. For severe infections, higher doses (up to 100 mg/kg/day) might be necessary, but this should be reduced to 50 mg/kg/day as soon as possible.  Infants and children with potentially immature metabolic functions may require lower doses (e.g., 25 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours).

**Dosage Adjustments:** Specific adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not explicitly detailed in manufacturer labeling, but caution is advised, and adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient needs and clinical assessment.


### Side Effects

Chloramphenicol can cause a range of side effects, some common and some rare but serious.  **It's crucial to report any unusual symptoms to a doctor immediately.**

**Common Side Effects:**

*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea and vomiting
*   Stomach upset
*   Skin rash
*   Headache

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

*   **Blood dyscrasias (bone marrow suppression):** This includes aplastic anemia (a severe reduction in red blood cells), hypoplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and granulocytopenia (low white blood cell count).  These are life-threatening and can be fatal.
*   **Gray baby syndrome (in newborns):** This is a serious condition characterized by cyanosis (bluish skin), respiratory problems, and circulatory collapse.
*   **Optic neuritis:** Inflammation of the optic nerve, potentially causing vision problems.
*   **Allergic reactions:**  Anaphylaxis, angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), and other hypersensitivity reactions.


### How it Works

Chloramphenicol is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, meaning it inhibits the growth of bacteria rather than directly killing them. It achieves this by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit within bacterial cells.  This prevents the bacteria from synthesizing proteins necessary for their survival and replication, effectively halting their growth and allowing the body's immune system to clear the infection.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Chloramphenicol is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components. It should not be used for minor infections or as a preventative measure.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Chloramphenicol can interact with numerous other medications.  It's essential to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.  Interactions can lead to either decreased effectiveness of chloramphenicol or increased risk of side effects from other drugs.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Chloramphenicol is categorized as a Category C drug in the US (meaning potential risks to the fetus) and Category A in Australia (meaning it's considered safe).  However, use during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, should be carefully considered due to the risk of bone marrow suppression in the newborn.  It's generally avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to the risk of gray baby syndrome and the excretion of the drug in breast milk.
*   **Patients with Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency:** Individuals with G6PD deficiency are at increased risk of hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells) when using chloramphenicol.
*   **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney disease.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the infection and the dosage, but improvement is usually observed within a few days.

*   **Q: Can I take it with other medications?** A:  No, inform your physician or pharmacist of all medications you take to avoid potential drug interactions.

*   **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store according to the instructions on the packaging, usually in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.

*   **Q: Is chloramphenicol safe for everyone?** A: No, chloramphenicol has several contraindications and precautions. It carries a significant risk of serious blood disorders and should only be used when absolutely necessary under the guidance of a qualified medical professional.
