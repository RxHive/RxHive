# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Menthol

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to temporarily relieve symptoms of the common cold or flu in adults and children (as directed on the product label).  Specifically, it targets:

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  This is an antihistamine that helps relieve runny nose and sneezing.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This is a cough suppressant (antitussive) that helps reduce coughing.
* **Menthol:** This provides a cooling sensation, offering some relief from nasal congestion and throat irritation.

This medication is typically used for symptomatic relief and does *not* cure the underlying illness.  Always follow the dosage instructions carefully and consult a doctor if symptoms worsen or persist for more than a week.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect of chlorpheniramine.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth:**  Drink plenty of fluids to alleviate this.
* **Constipation:** Increase fluid and fiber intake.
* **Nausea:**  If severe, consult a doctor.
* **Dizziness:** Avoid activities requiring alertness.
* **Headache:** Usually mild and transient.
* **Irritability (especially in children):** This is more common with higher doses.

More serious, though less common, side effects can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Hives, swelling, difficulty breathing.
* **Fast heartbeat:**  Tachycardia.
* **Seizures:**  Especially with higher doses or pre-existing conditions.
* **Hallucinations:** More common with higher doses of dextromethorphan.

This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects may occur. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for complete information.


**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This helps reduce runny nose and sneezing.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
* **Menthol:** Creates a cooling sensation on the skin and mucous membranes, which can temporarily relieve discomfort from nasal congestion and sore throat.  The mechanism is primarily a local effect.
