# Cefixime

**Generic Name:** Cefixime

**Usage:** Cefixime is an oral cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Respiratory tract infections:** Bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, pharyngitis (sore throat), tonsillitis.
* **Ear infections (otitis media):**  Especially in children.
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** Cystitis, pyelonephritis.
* **Gonorrhea:**  Specifically, uncomplicated cervicitis and urethritis.  (Note:  Cefixime is *not* recommended for treating disseminated gonococcal infection.)
* **Typhoid fever:**  Although fluoroquinolones are generally preferred.

**Important Note:** Cefixime is only effective against bacteria; it will not treat viral infections like the common cold or flu.  Always consult a doctor to determine if cefixime is the appropriate treatment for your infection.  Improper use can lead to antibiotic resistance.


**Side Effects:** Like all medications, cefixime can cause side effects, although many people experience none or only mild ones.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Diarrhea (sometimes severe), nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives. In rare cases, more serious allergic reactions like angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) or anaphylaxis can occur.  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any signs of a severe allergic reaction.**
* **Headache:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis):**  Antibiotics can disrupt the natural balance of gut and vaginal flora.
* **Increased risk of *Clostridium difficile* infection:** This bacterium can cause severe diarrhea and colitis.

Less common but more serious side effects can also occur.


**How it Works:** Cefixime is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that works by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a vital component of bacterial cell walls.  This weakens the cell wall, leading to bacterial cell death.  Different bacteria have varying susceptibility to cefixime.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take cefixime with other medications?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking, as interactions are possible.  Certain medications can affect how cefixime works, or vice versa.
* **What if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **How long should I take cefixime?**  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Stopping treatment early can lead to treatment failure and the development of antibiotic resistance.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking cefixime?**  While there's no direct contraindication, alcohol can sometimes worsen gastrointestinal side effects.  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking cefixime unless your doctor advises otherwise.
* **Is cefixime safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Consult your doctor before taking cefixime if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  The risks and benefits should be carefully weighed.
* **What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** Stop taking cefixime and seek immediate medical attention.
