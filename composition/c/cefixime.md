# Cefixime
### Generic Name
Cefixime

### Usage

Cefixime is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the cephalosporin family.  Its primary use is in treating bacterial infections. Specifically, it's effective against a range of bacteria causing infections in various parts of the body.  The conditions it commonly treats include:

* **Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):**  Cefixime is used to treat UTIs that are not complicated by other health issues, such as kidney stones or an underlying medical condition.
* **Acute Otitis Media (Middle Ear Infection):** It effectively combats bacterial infections in the middle ear, a common cause of earaches, especially in children.
* **Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis (Strep Throat):** Cefixime can treat strep throat, caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, especially in individuals with mild penicillin allergies (always under the guidance of a physician).  
* **Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis:** This antibiotic helps manage flare-ups of chronic bronchitis, often caused by bacterial infections.
* **Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (Cervical/Urethra):** Although not the first-line treatment according to the CDC (Ceftriaxone is preferred), Cefixime can be used to treat uncomplicated gonorrhea in cases where Ceftriaxone is unavailable.  It's typically used in combination with another antibiotic like azithromycin.

It's crucial to understand that Cefixime is only effective against bacterial infections. It won't work against viral infections like the common cold or flu.  The use of Cefixime for other conditions, such as typhoid fever or acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, is often considered off-label, meaning it's used outside its officially approved indications and requires careful consideration by a physician.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the infection being treated, the patient's age and weight, and kidney function.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  The information below is for general guidance only and should not replace professional medical advice.

**Adults:**  The usual dose ranges from 200mg to 400mg daily, taken once or twice daily, depending on the severity and type of infection. For uncomplicated gonorrhea, a single 400mg dose is usually prescribed, often combined with azithromycin.

**Children:** The dose for children is typically calculated based on their weight, usually 8mg per kilogram of body weight per day, divided into two doses.  The maximum daily dose is 400mg.  Pediatric dosages should always be determined by a pediatrician.

**Forms:** Cefixime is available in different forms, such as tablets (including chewable tablets), and oral suspension (liquid).

**Administration:**  Tablets should be swallowed whole with water, unless specified otherwise (chewable tablets should be chewed). Oral suspensions should be shaken well before each dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be needed for individuals with kidney problems.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on your kidney function.


### Side Effects

Like all medications, Cefixime can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Dizziness

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from rash to anaphylaxis - a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Pseudomembranous colitis (a severe intestinal infection)
* Increased liver enzyme levels
* Kidney problems


If you experience any side effects, especially severe ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Cefixime is a beta-lactam antibiotic that works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  Specifically, it inhibits the enzymes responsible for building the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall.  This disruption causes the bacterial cell wall to weaken and eventually break down, leading to the death of the bacteria.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Cefixime should not be used by individuals with known allergies to cephalosporins or penicillins, as cross-reactivity can occur.
* **Kidney Problems:**  People with kidney disease require careful monitoring and potential dose adjustments when taking Cefixime.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of Cefixime during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Interactions:** Cefixime may interact with other medications. Inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are currently taking.
* **Alcohol:** While there is no direct interaction noted, excessive alcohol consumption can stress the liver, which could negatively impact Cefixime metabolism and increase the risk of side effects. Moderation is advised.
* **Gastrointestinal Issues:** Cefixime can cause gastrointestinal upset. Consider taking it with food to minimize this risk.


### FAQs

* **Can I take Cefixime with food?**  It can generally be taken with or without food, but taking it with food may help reduce stomach upset.

* **How should I store Cefixime?** Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep it out of children's reach.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Can I stop taking Cefixime early if I feel better?** No, complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you start feeling better. Stopping early can lead to incomplete treatment and potential recurrence of the infection.

* **Is Cefixime safe for everyone?** Cefixime may not be suitable for everyone.  Pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and individuals with underlying medical conditions (particularly kidney disease) should talk to their doctor before taking it.

* **What if I have an allergic reaction?**  Stop taking Cefixime immediately and seek medical attention if you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as rash, itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing.
