# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ammonium Chloride

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ammonium Chloride

**Usage:**  This combination medication is an expectorant and antihistamine used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or flu, including:

* Runny nose
* Sneezing
* Coughing (specifically a cough with mucus)
* Itching, watery eyes

**Note:**  This combination is less frequently prescribed now due to concerns about the potential harm of ammonium chloride.  Doctors often prefer to prescribe separate antihistamines and expectorants, or alternative treatments, to better manage individual symptoms.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect of chlorpheniramine maleate.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth, nose, and throat:** This is common with antihistamines.
* **Constipation:**  A potential side effect.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Less common but possible.
* **Headache:**  May occur.
* **Dizziness:** Possible side effect.
* **Increased heart rate (tachycardia):**  Less common but possible.
* **Ammonium Chloride specific side effects:**  These include  acidification of the blood (metabolic acidosis), especially in patients with kidney problems or those on certain diets.  Symptoms of metabolic acidosis can include weakness, nausea, and vomiting.

**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body in response to allergens or infection. By blocking histamine, it helps relieve symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes.
* **Ammonium Chloride:** This is an expectorant that helps thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.  It works by increasing the acidity of the urine and possibly the respiratory secretions.
