# Chlorpheniramine Maleate
### Generic Name
Chlorpheniramine Maleate

### Usage
Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergies.  Its main use is to treat the runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, and itching associated with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and other upper respiratory allergies.  It's also sometimes used to treat urticaria (hives) and other allergic skin reactions. While it can help with some cold symptoms, it's not effective against the underlying viral infection causing the cold.  It's important to note that chlorpheniramine maleate primarily targets the symptoms of allergies and not the root cause.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on the formulation (tablet, syrup, injection), the patient's age and weight, and the severity of symptoms.  **Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions precisely.**  The information below is for general guidance only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

* **Oral (Adults):** Typical adult doses range from 4 to 8 mg every 4 to 6 hours, not exceeding 24 mg in 24 hours.  Specific tablet or syrup strengths will determine how many tablets or milliliters are needed to achieve the prescribed dose.

* **Oral (Children):**  Dosage for children is strictly weight-based and should only be determined by a healthcare professional.  Never administer adult dosages to children.  Liquid formulations are usually preferred for children, and the correct dosage will be measured using a calibrated measuring device, not a household spoon.

* **Intravenous (IV):** IV administration is typically reserved for hospitalized patients and is administered under strict medical supervision. Dosages are determined by the healthcare professional based on the patient's condition and response.

**Important Note:**  Overdosing on chlorpheniramine maleate can be dangerous.  Always adhere to the prescribed dosage and consult a healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns.

* Drowsiness

* Dizziness
* Blurred vision

If you experience any serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Chlorpheniramine maleate is a first-generation antihistamine. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body in response to allergens.  Histamine causes many of the uncomfortable symptoms of allergies, such as runny nose, sneezing, and itching. By blocking histamine receptors, chlorpheniramine maleate reduces or prevents these symptoms.
