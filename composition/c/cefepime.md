# Cefepime

**Generic Name:** Cefepime

**Usage:** Cefepime is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Serious infections of the lungs (pneumonia):** Particularly those caused by gram-negative bacteria.
* **Infections of the urinary tract (UTIs):** Including complicated UTIs and pyelonephritis.
* **Infections of the abdomen:** Such as peritonitis.
* **Infections of the skin and skin structures:** Including cellulitis and abscesses.
* **Meningitis:** Infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
* **Septicemia (bloodstream infection):**  A severe and potentially life-threatening condition.
* **Other serious infections:** Where other antibiotics have failed or are unsuitable.


**Side Effects:** Like all medications, cefepime can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  These can range from mild to severe. Common side effects include:

* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are relatively common gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Diarrhea:**  Can range from mild to severe (in rare cases, potentially *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea).
* **Rash:** Allergic skin reactions can occur.
* **Headache:**  A relatively common side effect.
* **Pain at the injection site (if administered intravenously or intramuscularly):**  This is common with injections.
* **Eosinophilia:** An increase in eosinophils (a type of white blood cell).
* **Elevated liver enzymes:**  This can be indicative of liver impairment.

**Less common but more serious side effects include:**

* **Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis):**  A severe, life-threatening allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention.  Symptoms can include swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat; difficulty breathing; and a rapid heartbeat.
* **Seizures:** Especially at high doses or in patients with pre-existing seizure disorders.
* **Pseudomembranous colitis:** A severe bowel infection caused by *Clostridium difficile*.
* **Kidney problems:**  This is more likely in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Blood clotting disorders:** Though rare.

**How it Works:** Cefepime is a beta-lactam antibiotic.  It works by inhibiting the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  This disruption weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to cell lysis (rupture) and bacterial death. Cefepime is effective against a broad range of gram-negative bacteria and some gram-positive bacteria.
