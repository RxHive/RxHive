# Clobetasol + Salicylic Acid + Coal Tar

**Generic Name:**  Clobetasol propionate + Salicylic acid + Coal tar

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid (clobetasol propionate), a keratolytic (salicylic acid), and a coal tar preparation. It's used to treat various inflammatory skin conditions characterized by scaling, itching, and inflammation, often associated with psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis.  The specific conditions treated might vary depending on the formulation and doctor's recommendation. It's crucial to only use this medication as prescribed by a physician.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the concentration, duration of use, and individual sensitivity.  Common side effects include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, stinging, redness, dryness, itching, rash
* **Skin thinning (atrophy):** Prolonged use, especially on sensitive areas, can lead to skin thinning.
* **Stretch marks (striae):**  Possible with prolonged use.
* **Acne:**  Increased acne breakouts in some individuals.
* **Telangiectasia:**  Visible small blood vessels on the skin.
* **Hypopigmentation:** Loss of skin color (lightening).
* **Hypertrichosis:** Increased hair growth.
* **Allergic contact dermatitis:** Allergic reaction to one or more of the ingredients.
* **Systemic effects:** While rare with topical use, prolonged or extensive use can lead to systemic absorption and potential side effects such as adrenal suppression (especially in children and with large surface area application).


**How it Works:**

* **Clobetasol propionate:**  A potent corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response in the skin.
* **Salicylic acid:**  A keratolytic agent that helps soften and remove scales and thickened skin by breaking down the bonds between skin cells.
* **Coal tar:**  A complex mixture of chemicals with anti-inflammatory and keratolytic properties.  It helps reduce scaling, itching, and inflammation, and may slow the growth of skin cells.  The exact mechanism of action of coal tar is not fully understood.

The combination of these three ingredients works synergistically to treat the symptoms of inflammatory skin conditions more effectively than using any single agent alone.  The corticosteroids reduce inflammation, salicylic acid removes scales, and coal tar further helps control inflammation and scaling.
