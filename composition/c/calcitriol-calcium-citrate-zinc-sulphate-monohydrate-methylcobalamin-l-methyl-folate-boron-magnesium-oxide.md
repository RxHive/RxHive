# Calcitriol + Calcium citrate + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Methylcobalamin + L-Methyl Folate + Boron + Magnesium Oxide
### Generic Name:  Calcitriol + Calcium Citrate + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Methylcobalamin + L-Methylfolate + Boron + Magnesium Oxide


This combination is not a single generic medicine with an official name. It represents a multi-nutrient formula often used to address nutritional deficiencies and support bone health.  Each component plays a distinct role:

### Usage

This combined formulation is primarily used to address deficiencies and support the following:

* **Bone health:** Calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D), calcium citrate, and magnesium oxide are crucial for bone formation and mineralization.  Zinc plays a supporting role in bone metabolism.
* **Calcium deficiency:** Calcium citrate provides supplemental calcium to correct deficiencies.
* **Vitamin D deficiency:** Calcitriol addresses low vitamin D levels.
* **Vitamin B12 deficiency:** Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) is essential for nerve function and red blood cell formation.
* **Folate deficiency:** L-methylfolate (the active form of folate, vitamin B9) is vital for cell growth and development.
* **Zinc deficiency:** Zinc sulfate monohydrate provides supplemental zinc, supporting various bodily functions including immune function and wound healing.
* **Boron deficiency:** Boron may play a role in bone health, brain function, and other metabolic processes although research is ongoing. Magnesium oxide supplements magnesium levels.


The specific uses and indications depend on the individual's diagnosed deficiencies and health status.  A healthcare provider will determine the appropriateness of this combination therapy based on individual needs and test results.

### Dosage

There is no standardized dosage for this combination as formulations vary widely depending on the manufacturer.  Dosage instructions are **always** provided on the product label and should be followed precisely.  It is critical to consult with a doctor or pharmacist to determine the appropriate dosage based on individual requirements, including age, weight, underlying health conditions and the results of any blood tests.  Oral administration is typical for all components in this combination. Intravenous (IV) administration is not standard for these nutrients.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, constipation, diarrhea, upset stomach (often related to calcium and magnesium).
* **Headache**
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling.


Less common but potentially serious side effects:

* **Hypercalcemia:**  Elevated blood calcium levels (due to excessive calcium intake). Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, constipation, weakness, and confusion.
* **Hypervitaminosis D:**  Excessive vitamin D levels. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, weakness, and kidney problems.
* **Kidney stones** (a risk with high calcium intake)

**Note:** This list is not exhaustive.  Any unusual or persistent side effects should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Each component in this multi-nutrient formula works independently to address specific nutritional deficiencies or support bodily functions:

* **Calcitriol:** Increases calcium absorption in the gut and promotes bone mineralization.
* **Calcium Citrate:** Provides readily absorbable calcium, the primary building block of bones and teeth.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** Plays a crucial role in numerous enzymatic processes and supports immune function.
* **Methylcobalamin:**  Essential coenzyme involved in DNA synthesis, nerve function, and red blood cell formation.
* **L-Methylfolate:** Important for cell growth, DNA synthesis, and the prevention of neural tube defects.
* **Boron:** Its role in human physiology is less well understood but it is thought to play some role in bone health and may affect magnesium and calcium metabolism.
* **Magnesium Oxide:** Involved in hundreds of enzymatic processes, muscle function, nerve function, and bone health.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This combination should be avoided by individuals with hypercalcemia, hypervitaminosis D, kidney stones, or known allergies to any of the ingredients.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This combination may interact with certain medications, such as diuretics, heart medications, and some antibiotics.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using this combination during pregnancy or breastfeeding, as appropriate dosages may need adjustment.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.  Careful monitoring is often recommended.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Patients with kidney disease should use this combination with caution due to the risk of hypercalcemia and potential strain on the kidneys.
* **Storage:** Store as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place.
