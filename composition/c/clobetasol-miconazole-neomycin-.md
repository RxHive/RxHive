# Clobetasol - + Miconazole + Neomycin -

**Generic Name:** Clobetasol propionate + Miconazole nitrate + Neomycin sulfate

**Usage:** This triple-combination topical cream or ointment is used to treat skin conditions that involve inflammation, fungal infection, and bacterial infection simultaneously.  Specific conditions it might be prescribed for include:

* **Infected eczema (dermatitis) with a suspected fungal or bacterial component:**  This is a common application where the anti-inflammatory (clobetasol), antifungal (miconazole), and antibacterial (neomycin) properties are all needed.
* **Infected tinea infections (ringworm) with significant inflammation:** The combination combats the fungal infection and the inflammatory response.


**It is crucial to note that this medication should only be used as prescribed by a doctor. Self-treating can be dangerous.**  The doctor will assess whether the combination is appropriate for your specific condition and skin area.

**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the duration of use. Common side effects include:

* **Burning, stinging, or itching at the application site:** This is often mild and temporary.
* **Skin thinning (atrophy):** Prolonged use of clobetasol can lead to skin thinning and other skin changes.
* **Skin discoloration (hypopigmentation):** The skin may become lighter in the treated area.
* **Stretch marks (striae):**  This is a potential long-term side effect of corticosteroid use.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Reactions such as redness, swelling, and blistering can occur, especially to neomycin.  Neomycin allergy is relatively common.
* **Fungal or bacterial resistance:** Prolonged use can lead to the development of resistant strains.
* **Systemic effects (rare):** Absorption of the corticosteroids into the body can occur, particularly with widespread application, leading to systemic side effects like Cushing's syndrome (though rare with topical use).


**How it Works:** This combination medication works through the combined actions of its three components:

* **Clobetasol propionate (corticosteroid):** Reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response in the skin.
* **Miconazole nitrate (antifungal):** Kills fungi by interfering with their cell membranes, thus treating fungal infections like ringworm or yeast infections.
* **Neomycin sulfate (antibiotic):** Kills bacteria by interfering with their protein synthesis, treating bacterial infections.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any severe or persistent side effects.
* **Can I use this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.  The benefits must outweigh the potential risks.
* **Can I use this on children?** Use in children should only be under strict medical supervision due to the risk of increased absorption and side effects.
