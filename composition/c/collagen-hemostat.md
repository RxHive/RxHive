# Collagen Hemostat
### Generic Name
Collagen Hemostat

### Usage
Collagen hemostat is a topical hemostatic agent used in surgical procedures.  Its primary use is to control bleeding when standard methods like sutures or cautery are insufficient or impractical.  It's used as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, other bleeding control techniques.  While primarily used during surgery, it aids in controlling bleeding from various sources within the surgical field.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** The dosage is determined by the amount needed to achieve hemostasis (stopping the bleeding).  It's applied topically as a powder, sheet, or sponge directly to the bleeding site.  For capillary bleeding, approximately 1 gram may suffice for a 50 cm² area; however, more may be required for severe bleeding.  Excess material should be removed after approximately 5-10 minutes.  If bleeding persists, additional collagen hemostat can be applied as needed.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of collagen hemostat in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
* **Common:** Adhesion formation, allergic reactions, edema (swelling), foreign body reaction, hematoma (blood clot), inflammation, and increased risk of infection.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Numbness, pain, paralysis, subgaleal seroma (fluid collection under the scalp), alveolalgia (toothache), and transient laryngospasm (temporary spasm of the voice box – specifically reported with dental use).

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Collagen hemostat is made from purified bovine (cow) collagen, processed into tiny fibers.  Its large surface area attracts platelets (blood cells essential for clotting).  Platelets adhere to the collagen fibers, triggering a cascade of events that leads to the formation of a blood clot (thrombus), effectively stopping the bleeding.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Collagen hemostat should not be used to close skin incisions or applied to bone surfaces where prosthetic materials are attached with methylmethacrylate adhesives.

**Increased Risk:** There's an increased risk of pain, numbness, or paralysis, particularly if the product is used improperly or in inappropriate locations.

**General Precautions:**
* **Topical Use Only:**  This medication is for topical application during surgical procedures only. It is not intended for injection, intraocular (within the eye), or intravascular (within blood vessels) use.
* **Wet Surfaces:** The material adheres to wet surfaces, so the bleeding site should be dried thoroughly before application. Dry forceps should be used.
* **Removal of Excess:** After hemostasis is achieved (typically 5-10 minutes), remove any excess material.
* **Contaminated Wounds:** Use in contaminated or infected wounds may increase the risk of infection.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Collagen hemostat contains bovine serum protein.  Individuals with known sensitivities to bovine-derived collagen should avoid using this product.
* **Avoidance in Certain Situations:** Avoid using in areas with pooled blood, submerged hemorrhage points, or in situations of forceful arterial bleeding, as it may obscure the bleeding source.  It shouldn't be used with autologous blood salvage circuits.
* **Single Use Only:** Do not reuse, reprocess, resterilize, or repackage the product.
