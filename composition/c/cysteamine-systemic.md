# Cysteamine (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Cysteamine (Systemic)

### Usage
Cysteamine (systemic) is primarily used to treat nephropathic cystinosis.  This is a rare genetic disorder where cystine, an amino acid, builds up in the body's cells, causing significant damage to various organs, most notably the kidneys.  Cysteamine helps reduce the cystine levels in these cells, thereby slowing the progression of the disease and potentially mitigating its harmful effects.  Currently, it's the only medication approved for this specific condition.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Treatment should begin as soon as a diagnosis of nephropathic cystinosis is confirmed.  Dosage is highly individualized and depends on factors like age, weight, and response to treatment, specifically white blood cell (WBC) cystine levels.  Regular monitoring of WBC cystine levels is crucial to adjust the dosage appropriately.  The goal is to maintain WBC cystine concentrations below 1 nmol/half-cystine/mg protein; however, patients who don't tolerate higher doses might still benefit from lower doses that keep levels below 2 nmol/half-cystine/mg protein.

**Adults:**

* **Oral, Immediate-Release:**  Starts at 1/6 to 1/4 of the target maintenance dose, gradually increasing over 4-6 weeks to a maintenance dose of 2g/day divided into four doses. The maximum dose is 1.95 g/m²/day or 90 mg/kg/day.
* **Oral, Delayed-Release:** Starts at 0.2-0.3 g/m²/day divided every 12 hours, gradually titrated upwards over 4-6 weeks to a maintenance dose of 1.3 g/m²/day, divided every 12 hours.  The maximum dose remains at 1.95 g/m²/day.  Dosage adjustments should be made in 10% increments.

**Children:**

Dosage for children is complex and depends on both body surface area (BSA) and weight, with variations based on age.  The initial dose is typically 1/6 to 1/4 of the maintenance dose and is gradually increased. Specific weight-based recommendations are provided in the manufacturer's labeling.  Refer to the prescribing information for precise dosing schedules.

**Switching Between Immediate and Delayed Release:** If switching from immediate-release to delayed-release Cysteamine, the initial daily dose of the delayed-release should match the total daily dose of the immediate-release formulation, divided into two doses per day.  Close monitoring of WBC cystine levels is essential after switching.

**Dosage Adjustments for Impaired Liver or Kidney Function:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.

### How it Works

Cysteamine is a medication that acts within the body's lysosomes (cellular compartments). It participates in a chemical reaction that reduces the amount of cystine, a harmful amino acid, in cells.  By lowering cystine levels, Cysteamine helps prevent or slow the damage caused by cystine accumulation in nephropathic cystinosis.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Cysteamine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to Cysteamine, penicillamine, or any component of the formulation.

**Drug Interactions:** Concurrent use of Cysteamine with proton-pump inhibitors, drugs containing bicarbonate or carbonate, and alcohol should be avoided or managed carefully due to potential interactions that can alter Cysteamine's effectiveness and safety.

**Warnings:**  Patients should be closely monitored for potential side effects, especially neurological symptoms (depression, seizures, etc.), skin reactions, and gastrointestinal problems.  There's an increased risk of Ehlers-Danlos-like syndrome, a connective tissue disorder.  Use with caution in neonates (formulations containing propylene glycol).  Pregnant women should carefully weigh the risks and benefits before using Cysteamine. Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking Cysteamine.


### FAQs

**Q: How should I store Cysteamine?** A:  Store Cysteamine as directed on the product label. Generally, this involves storing it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: The instructions for handling missed doses vary depending on whether you are taking immediate-release or delayed-release Cysteamine.  Always refer to the prescribing information for the specific instructions.  Generally, it's advised not to double the dose.

**Q: Can I take Cysteamine with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting Cysteamine.  Some medications can interact negatively.

**Q: Are there long-term effects of Cysteamine use?** A:  Long-term use of Cysteamine can have various potential side effects, as previously described. Regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor your health and adjust the dosage as needed are essential.

**Q:  What are the signs of a serious allergic reaction?** A: Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, and hives.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
