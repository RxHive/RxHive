# Calcium

**Generic Name:** Calcium (various salts, e.g., Calcium Carbonate, Calcium Citrate, Calcium Gluconate)

**Usage:**

Calcium supplements are used to treat or prevent low blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia).  They are also used to treat and prevent conditions caused by low calcium such as osteoporosis (weak bones), osteomalacia (soft bones), and hypoparathyroidism (a condition where the parathyroid glands don't produce enough parathyroid hormone).  Certain calcium salts are also used as antacids to relieve heartburn and indigestion.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women often require supplemental calcium.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects of calcium supplements vary depending on the specific salt used and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Constipation:** This is a very common side effect.
* **Gas:**  Bloating and flatulence can occur.
* **Nausea:**  Some individuals experience nausea, especially with higher doses.
* **Abdominal pain:**  Cramps or discomfort in the abdomen.
* **Kidney stones:**  High calcium intake can increase the risk of kidney stones in susceptible individuals, particularly those with a history of kidney stones.  This is more of a concern with prolonged high-dose supplementation.


**Rare but serious side effects:**

* **Milk-alkali syndrome:**  A rare but potentially life-threatening condition that occurs with excessive calcium and alkali (bicarbonate) intake. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, constipation, kidney problems, and confusion.


**How it Works:**

Calcium is an essential mineral for many bodily functions, including:

* **Bone health:** Calcium is a major component of bone, providing strength and structure.
* **Muscle function:** Calcium plays a critical role in muscle contraction and relaxation.
* **Nerve function:**  Calcium is involved in nerve impulse transmission.
* **Blood clotting:** Calcium is essential for blood clotting.
* **Heart rhythm:** Calcium helps regulate the heart's rhythm.

Calcium supplements work by increasing the amount of calcium in the blood, helping to correct deficiencies and support these vital processes.  The body's absorption of calcium can vary depending on the type of calcium salt (carbonate, citrate, gluconate, etc.) and other factors like the presence of vitamin D.

**FAQs:**

* **What type of calcium supplement should I take?**  This depends on individual needs and factors like absorption.  Calcium carbonate is usually less expensive and contains more elemental calcium per tablet, but requires stomach acid for better absorption. Calcium citrate is better absorbed even without much stomach acid. Your doctor can recommend the best type for you.
* **How much calcium should I take?**  The recommended daily allowance of calcium varies with age and other factors.  It's crucial to consult a doctor or registered dietitian to determine the appropriate dosage for your specific needs.  Excessive intake can be harmful.
* **Should I take calcium with food?**  Taking calcium with food can help reduce the risk of stomach upset.  However, food may also decrease absorption, so this should be considered.
* **Can I get enough calcium from diet alone?**  For many individuals, a balanced diet rich in calcium-rich foods (dairy, leafy greens, fortified foods) is sufficient. However, some people may need supplements to meet their daily needs.
* **What are the interactions with other medications?** Calcium can interact with certain medications, such as some antibiotics, thyroid medications, and certain heart medications.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking.
