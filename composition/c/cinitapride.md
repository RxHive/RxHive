# Cinitapride
### Generic Name
Cinitapride

### Usage
Cinitapride is a prokinetic agent primarily used to treat gastrointestinal motility disorders.  Its main applications include managing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), ulcer dyspepsia (indigestion with or without ulcers), and functional gastrointestinal disorders characterized by slow gastric emptying.  Essentially, it helps improve the movement of food through the digestive tract.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** The typical adult dose for GERD, ulcer dyspepsia, and functional gastrointestinal motility disorders is 1 mg three times a day (TID) orally.  This should be taken at least 15 minutes before meals with a full glass of water.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Cinitapride is contraindicated in children; its use is not recommended for pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The safety and efficacy of cinitapride have not been established in patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Therefore, adjustments are not recommended, and use should be approached cautiously if at all in this population with close monitoring.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Headache
* Drowsiness or dizziness
* Worsening of existing stomach problems
* Loss of appetite
* Nausea or vomiting
* Stomach discomfort
* Diarrhea or constipation
* Muscle or joint pain
* Discolored urine or stools
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible.  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Cinitapride works by affecting the release and action of serotonin and dopamine in the gastrointestinal tract. It blocks serotonin receptors and increases serotonin release, leading to enhanced serotonergic activity. It also shows antidopaminergic effects. This dual action improves the contractions of the stomach and intestines, facilitating the efficient movement of food through the digestive system, thus relieving symptoms associated with the conditions it treats.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Cinitapride is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, and those with gastrointestinal bleeding, mechanical obstruction, or perforation.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution in elderly patients as it may enhance the action of acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter).  There is an increased risk of tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements) with prolonged use in the elderly.
* **Patients with History of Dyskinesia:** Use with caution in patients with a history of neuroleptic-induced dyskinesia.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety and efficacy of cinitapride have not been established during pregnancy and lactation. Therefore, its use is not recommended in pregnant or breastfeeding women.

**Alcohol Interaction:**  Limit alcohol intake as it may worsen side effects.

**Driving and Machinery:**  Cinitapride may cause drowsiness, blurred vision, or dizziness.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until these effects are known.
