# Cinitapride

**Generic Name:** Cinapride

**Usage:**  Cinitapride is **no longer available in most countries** due to safety concerns.  It was previously used to treat gastrointestinal disorders, specifically focusing on improving gastric motility (the movement of food through the stomach and intestines).  Its primary use was in treating dyspepsia (indigestion) and gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying).  **It is crucial to understand that due to its removal from the market, it should not be used unless specifically prescribed by a doctor and obtained through legitimate channels (which are likely extremely limited).**

**Side Effects:**  Cinitapride carries significant risks of serious side effects, which contributed to its withdrawal from the market. These included:

* **Cardiac arrhythmias:**  This is the most serious risk, potentially leading to life-threatening conditions.
* **Extrapyramidal symptoms:**  These neurological side effects can manifest as muscle stiffness, tremors, involuntary movements, and restlessness.
* **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):** A rare but potentially fatal complication characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  Could lead to dizziness and fainting.
* **Gastrointestinal disturbances:**  Including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
* **Drowsiness and fatigue:**
* **Prolactin elevation:** This can lead to galactorrhea (breast milk production in non-breastfeeding individuals), menstrual irregularities, and gynecomastia (breast enlargement in males).


**How it Works:** Cinitapride is a prokinetic agent. It works by blocking dopamine receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. This action increases the contractions of the stomach and intestines, facilitating the movement of food through the digestive system.  However, its action on dopamine receptors in the brain is what contributes to the significant risk of side effects.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is cinitapride still available?** A: No, it is no longer widely available in most countries due to safety concerns.
* **Q: What are the alternatives to cinitapride?** A:  Several other prokinetic agents are available, but they have their own potential side effects and should only be used under medical supervision.  Your doctor can discuss suitable alternatives based on your individual needs.
* **Q: Is it safe to take cinitapride?** A: No, due to the significant risk of serious cardiac and neurological side effects, cinitapride is considered unsafe and should not be used unless specifically prescribed and monitored by a doctor in a very limited exceptional circumstance (which is highly unlikely).
* **Q:  I have some old cinitapride. Should I use it?** A: No, do not use any leftover cinitapride.  Dispose of it properly according to your local regulations.  Consult your pharmacist or doctor for guidance on safe disposal.
