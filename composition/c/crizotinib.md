# Crizotinib
### Generic Name
Crizotinib

### Usage

Crizotinib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat certain types of cancer.  Its main application is in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) where the tumor cells are positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1.  This means the cancer's growth is driven by the abnormal activity of these specific genes.  An FDA-approved test is required to confirm ALK or ROS1 positivity before Crizotinib is prescribed for NSCLC.

Beyond lung cancer, Crizotinib is also indicated for:

* **Relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL):** This is a type of lymphoma (a cancer of the lymphatic system) in children aged 1 year and older, and young adults, where the cancer cells are ALK-positive.  "Relapsed" means the cancer has returned after treatment, and "refractory" means it hasn't responded to previous treatments.
* **Unresectable, recurrent, or refractory inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT):** This is a rare tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, particularly in children aged 1 year and older.  Again, ALK-positivity must be confirmed before Crizotinib is considered.  "Unresectable" means the tumor cannot be surgically removed, "recurrent" means it has returned after treatment, and "refractory" means it hasn't responded to prior therapies.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific cancer being treated, the patient's age, and weight (particularly for children).  It's crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions precisely.  Crizotinib is typically administered orally (as capsules).

**Adults:**

* **Metastatic ALK- or ROS1-positive NSCLC:** The usual dose is 250 mg twice daily (BID) until disease progression or unacceptable side effects.
* **Unresectable, recurrent, or refractory ALK-positive IMT:**  The usual dose is 250 mg twice daily (BID) until disease progression or unacceptable side effects.

**Pediatric Patients (1 year and older):**

Dosage for ALCL and IMT is usually calculated based on body surface area (BSA) and is typically 280 mg/mÂ² twice daily (BID).  Specific dose ranges based on BSA are outlined in the prescribing information.  Always refer to this for precise guidance.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary based on factors like liver or kidney function, and the occurrence of side effects.  Specific guidelines for dose modifications are provided in the prescribing information.  These adjustments should only be made under the direction of a healthcare professional.

### Side Effects

Crizotinib, like other cancer therapies, can cause side effects.  The frequency and severity of these side effects vary from person to person.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Decreased appetite
* Vision problems
* Elevated liver enzyme levels

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs)
* QT interval prolongation (an abnormality in the heart's electrical activity)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Severe visual loss
* Severe liver damage


**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  Tyrosine kinases are enzymes that play a crucial role in cell signaling pathways involved in cell growth and division.  In ALK-positive or ROS1-positive cancers, mutations cause these kinases to become abnormally active, leading to uncontrolled cell growth.  Crizotinib works by binding to and inhibiting these abnormal kinases, blocking their activity and helping to slow or stop the cancer's growth.

### Precautions

* **Liver and Kidney Function:** Crizotinib's metabolism and excretion are affected by liver and kidney function. Dose adjustments might be needed in patients with impaired liver or kidney function. Regular monitoring of these functions is essential.
* **Drug Interactions:** Crizotinib interacts with certain medications, particularly those metabolized by the CYP3A enzyme system. Consult your doctor about all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements) you are taking to avoid potential harmful interactions. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided while taking Crizotinib.
* **Heart Rhythm:** Crizotinib can prolong the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), potentially increasing the risk of irregular heartbeats.  Careful monitoring of the heart's rhythm is necessary, especially in patients with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Crizotinib can harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for a period after treatment ends.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during Crizotinib therapy and for a specified time thereafter.
* **Other Precautions:** Crizotinib may increase photosensitivity; therefore, protection from sun exposure is recommended.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Crizotinib with food?** A: Yes, Crizotinib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose unless the next dose is due within 6 hours.

* **Q: How should I store Crizotinib?** A: Store Crizotinib as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and light.

* **Q:  Are there long-term effects associated with Crizotinib?** A: Long-term effects are possible and vary from patient to patient. Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is essential.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects to your doctor immediately.  Some side effects can be managed, while others may necessitate dose adjustment or discontinuation of the medication.
