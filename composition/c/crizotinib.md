# Crizotinib

**Generic Name:** Crizotinib

**Usage:** Crizotinib is a targeted therapy used to treat certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that have a specific genetic abnormality called an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1 rearrangement.  It may also be used in other cancers with these genetic alterations.  The specific use will depend on the individual's cancer type and stage, as determined by a physician.

**Side Effects:**  Crizotinib, like many cancer treatments, can cause a range of side effects.  These can vary in severity from person to person. Some common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite, abdominal pain.
* **Vision:** Blurred vision, vision changes.
* **Liver:** Elevated liver enzymes (indicated by blood tests).
* **Pulmonary:** Cough, shortness of breath.
* **Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy (numbness or tingling in the extremities),  somnolence (sleepiness).
* **Other:**  Weight loss, edema (swelling), elevated triglycerides, increased ALT and AST levels (liver function tests), QT interval prolongation (can affect the heart rhythm).


Serious side effects, though less common, are possible and require immediate medical attention. These may include:

* **Interstitial lung disease:** Inflammation and scarring of the lungs.
* **Severe liver problems:**  hepatotoxicity
* **Severe vision problems:**
* **Severe cardiac events:**  Arrhythmias


This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary. It is crucial to report any new or worsening symptoms to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by blocking the activity of the ALK and ROS1 proteins. These proteins are involved in the growth and spread of certain cancer cells. By inhibiting these proteins, crizotinib can slow or stop the growth of cancer cells that have these genetic alterations.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is crizotinib administered?** A: Crizotinib is usually taken orally (as a tablet).
* **Q: How long do I need to take crizotinib?** A: The duration of treatment will depend on your individual response to the medication and the progression of your cancer. Your oncologist will determine the appropriate treatment course.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions.
* **Q: What are the drug interactions of Crizotinib?** A: Crizotinib can interact with other medications.  It is essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided.
* **Q:  What are the monitoring requirements while on Crizotinib?** A:  Regular blood tests to monitor liver function, and sometimes other blood work will be needed to check for side effects and ensure the drug is working effectively.  Eye exams and ECGs may also be necessary.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Crizotinib?** A: Long-term effects vary greatly depending on individual response and duration of treatment.  Some patients may experience lingering side effects even after stopping the medication. It is important to discuss concerns about long-term effects with your oncologist.
