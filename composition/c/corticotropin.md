# Corticotropin
### Generic Name
Corticotropin

### Usage

Corticotropin is a systemic corticosteroid hormone used to treat a variety of conditions characterized by inflammation or immune system dysfunction.  Its primary use is in the management of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, providing symptomatic relief and potentially slowing disease progression.  It also finds use in treating other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions including:

* **Rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritic conditions:**  Corticotropin can reduce joint inflammation and pain in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.
* **Inflammatory bowel disease (though less common now):** While other medications are generally preferred, corticotropin might be used in severe cases where other treatments have failed.
* **Lupus:** Corticotropin can help manage the symptoms of lupus, particularly during periods of flare-up.
* **Severe allergic reactions:** In cases of severe, life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), corticotropin might be used in conjunction with other treatments to stabilize the patient.
* **Breathing disorders:** Corticotropin can help manage certain breathing disorders associated with inflammation and swelling of the airways.
* **Infantile spasms (West syndrome):** This is a specific neurological condition in infants, and corticotropin is a treatment option.
* **Nephrotic syndrome:** Corticotropin can help reduce protein loss in the urine associated with nephrotic syndrome.
* **Inflammatory eye conditions:** It can be used to manage severe inflammation of the eyes.


It's crucial to understand that corticotropin is not a first-line treatment for most of these conditions; its use is often reserved for severe cases or when other therapies haven't been effective.


### Dosage

Dosage of corticotropin varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the response to therapy.  Always follow a healthcare professional's precise instructions.  The following are examples and should not be considered a substitute for personalized medical advice:

**Adults:** Dosages are typically given intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SubQ).  The specifics, such as the number of units per dose and the frequency of administration, vary widely depending on the indication.  For example, in acute multiple sclerosis exacerbations, doses of 80-120 units per day for 2-3 weeks might be used, while for other conditions, lower doses at less frequent intervals may suffice.

**Children:** Pediatric dosages are calculated based on weight (units/kg/day) or body surface area (units/mÂ²/day).  Dosage adjustments are frequently needed based on the child's response. In infantile spasms (West syndrome), a specific regimen involving initial high doses followed by gradual tapering is typically followed.


**Forms:** Corticotropin is available in injectable forms.  It is crucial to follow the specific administration guidelines provided with the medication.


### Side Effects

Corticotropin, like other corticosteroids, can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but more serious.  

**Common Side Effects:**

* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Increased appetite and weight gain
* Mood changes (irritability, anxiety, depression)
* Fluid retention
* Increased blood sugar
*  Decreased glucose tolerance


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Cushingoid features (moon face, buffalo hump)
* Osteoporosis (weakening of bones)
* Infections (increased susceptibility)
*  Gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding
*  Muscle weakness
*  Electrolyte imbalances
*  Behavioral changes


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult a doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Corticotropin is a synthetic version of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).  It stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and other corticosteroids.  These hormones have widespread effects throughout the body, including:

* **Anti-inflammatory effects:**  Corticosteroids reduce inflammation by suppressing the immune system's response.
* **Immunosuppressive effects:** They reduce the activity of the immune system, which is beneficial in autoimmune conditions.

By increasing the body's production of cortisol, corticotropin helps control inflammation and suppress the immune system's activity, thereby alleviating symptoms associated with various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Corticotropin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the medication (especially those with allergies to porcine-derived products since it's often derived from pigs), and in certain situations like systemic fungal infections or recent surgeries.  Patients with scleroderma, osteoporosis, peptic ulcers, or uncontrolled hypertension should generally avoid this drug.
* **Interactions:**  Corticotropin can interact with various other drugs, including CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Corticotropin is classified as a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its effects on the developing fetus are not fully understood.  It's also excreted in breast milk.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using corticotropin if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Elderly and Children:** Special caution is warranted in elderly patients, who may be more susceptible to side effects like osteoporosis and infections.  Children, particularly infants, require careful dose adjustments and monitoring for growth and development.
* **Immunosuppression:** Corticotropin suppresses the immune system, making patients more vulnerable to infections. Avoid contact with individuals who are sick.
* **Sudden Withdrawal:** Abrupt discontinuation can cause adrenal insufficiency.  Always taper the dose gradually under medical supervision.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Corticotropin to work?**  A: The onset of effects varies depending on the condition and the dose.  Some individuals may experience improvements within days, while others might take longer.

* **Q: How is Corticotropin stored?** A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.  Generally, it should be stored in a refrigerator.

* **Q: Can I take Corticotropin with other medications?** A:  This is crucial to discuss with your doctor.  Interactions with other drugs are possible.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance; do not try to double up on the missed dose.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of using Corticotropin?** A: Long-term use can increase the risk of osteoporosis, cataracts, infections, and other adverse effects.  Your doctor will monitor you closely.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Corticotropin suddenly?** A: No, it's vital to taper off corticotropin gradually under medical supervision to avoid potentially serious withdrawal symptoms.
