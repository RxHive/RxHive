# Choline Magnesium Trisalicylate
### Generic Name
Choline Magnesium Trisalicylate

### Usage
Choline magnesium trisalicylate is a non-acetylated salicylate primarily used to manage acute painful shoulder conditions and fever (pyrexia).  It also finds application as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other suitable conditions.  This medication provides relief from mild to moderate pain and helps manage the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other arthritic conditions, both in the long term and during acute flares.

### Dosage

**Dosage is based on the salicylate content.**  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Acute painful shoulder, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, other severe arthritis:**  The usual dose is 1.5 grams twice daily (BID) or 3 grams once daily (OD) at bedtime.  The dose should be adjusted based on individual response. Treatment may last 2-3 weeks for optimal effects.

* **Analgesia (mild to moderate pain) or pyrexia:** The typical dose is 2-3 grams daily, divided into two or three doses.  Adjust the dose to achieve the best therapeutic response.  Treatment may last 2-3 weeks for optimal effects.


**Children and Adolescents:**

* **Inflammatory conditions (e.g., juvenile idiopathic arthritis) and analgesia (mild to moderate pain):**  Dosage is individualized based on weight and response.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose.  Refer to the prescribing information for specific weight-based recommendations or consult your doctor or pharmacist. Treatment may last 2-3 weeks for optimal effects.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for liver impairment. Use with caution and monitor salicylate levels.  Adjust the dose as needed under medical supervision.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Similar to hepatic impairment, specific dosage adjustments aren't provided for kidney problems. Use cautiously, avoid in severe renal impairment, and monitor salicylate levels closely.  Adjust the dose as needed under medical supervision.
* **Geriatric Patients:**  A typical starting dose might be 750 mg three times daily (TID), but this should be adjusted to achieve optimal response.  Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible in elderly patients.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 20% of patients):**

* Gastrointestinal issues: Constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, epigastric pain, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting.
* Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in less than 20% of patients):**

* Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, lethargy
* Auditory impairment
* Anorexia, asthma, bruising, confusion, duodenal ulcer, dysgeusia (altered taste), edema, epistaxis (nosebleed), erythema multiforme (skin rash), esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus), gastric ulcer, hallucination, hearing loss (potentially irreversible), increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, increased liver enzyme levels, increased serum creatinine levels, occult blood in stools, pruritus (itching), skin rash, and weight gain.


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Choline magnesium trisalicylate is a salicylate that weakly inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. This reduces the formation of prostaglandins, molecules that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever.  Besides COX inhibition, other mechanisms might also contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects, such as  inhibition of chemotaxis (movement of cells to a stimulus), alteration of lymphocyte activity, inhibition of neutrophil aggregation/activation, and a decrease in proinflammatory cytokine levels. These additional mechanisms are not fully understood.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Do not use choline magnesium trisalicylate if you are allergic to it, other salicylates (including aspirin), or any of its ingredients.
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects (such as nausea, vomiting, and upset stomach) and tinnitus.
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution if you have asthma, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, hepatic impairment, or renal impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during late pregnancy should be avoided because of potential effects on the fetal cardiovascular system. Choline magnesium trisalicylate is excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Children and Adolescents:** Avoid using salicylates in children and teenagers recovering from or with chickenpox, influenza, or flu-like symptoms because of the risk of Reye's syndrome (a rare but serious condition).


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store choline magnesium trisalicylate?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is it safe to take choline magnesium trisalicylate long-term?** A: Long-term use requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional to assess for side effects and effectiveness.
