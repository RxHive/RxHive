# Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12)
### Generic Name
Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12)

### Usage

Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic form of vitamin B12 primarily used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency.  This deficiency can arise from various causes, including inadequate dietary intake (particularly in vegans or vegetarians), impaired absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (pernicious anemia, gastritis, Crohn's disease, etc.), or certain medical conditions and treatments (e.g., gastric bypass surgery).  Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in several bodily functions, including the formation of red blood cells (hematopoiesis), nerve function, and DNA synthesis.  Consequently, deficiency leads to a range of symptoms, from fatigue and anemia to neurological problems like numbness, tingling, and cognitive impairment. Cyanocobalamin is also sometimes used off-label to treat recurrent aphthous ulcers, although more research is needed to establish its effectiveness in this context.

### Dosage

Dosage of cyanocobalamin varies significantly depending on the reason for treatment, the severity of the deficiency, the patient's age, and the route of administration.  The following are guidelines only, and a healthcare professional should always determine the appropriate dosage for each individual case:

* **Adults:** Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) is 2.4 mcg.  However, treatment for deficiency often involves much higher doses, ranging from 100 mcg to 2000 mcg, depending on the route of administration (oral, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal) and severity of deficiency.  Treatment may involve initial high doses followed by maintenance doses.  Specific regimens for different conditions (pernicious anemia, mild deficiency, severe deficiency, post-bariatric surgery) are detailed in the prescribing information and should be followed by a medical professional.

* **Children:**  The RDA varies with age, ranging from 0.4 mcg daily for infants to 1.8 mcg daily for 9-13 year olds.  Treatment for deficiency in children usually involves intramuscular or subcutaneous injections, with dosages determined by a healthcare professional considering the child's age, weight, and the severity of the deficiency.

* **Administration:** Cyanocobalamin is available in various forms, including oral tablets (some sublingual), intramuscular injections, subcutaneous injections, and intranasal sprays. Oral forms have variable absorption rates and may not be suitable for all individuals.  Intramuscular or subcutaneous injections generally provide better absorption and are often preferred for treating severe deficiencies. Intranasal administration is a convenient option for some individuals.

* **Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list of dosages. Always follow the dosage prescribed by a physician or other qualified healthcare professional.  Self-treating vitamin B12 deficiency can be risky.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and infrequent, including headache, diarrhea and skin rash.  However, more serious, though rarer, side effects can occur, such as:

* Anaphylactic shock (with injection)
* Pulmonary edema
* Cardiac failure
* Thrombosis (peripheral)
* Polycythemia vera
* Thrombocythemia

If any adverse effects occur, especially severe ones, contact a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Cyanocobalamin acts as a coenzyme in various metabolic pathways crucial for cell growth, function, and division.  It's essential for the synthesis of DNA and RNA, the metabolism of fatty acids and carbohydrates, and the proper functioning of the nervous system.  By replenishing vitamin B12 levels, cyanocobalamin corrects the metabolic deficiencies causing the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to improvement in energy levels, blood cell production, and neurological function.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Cyanocobalamin should not be used by individuals with known allergies to cyanocobalamin, cobalt, or any of its components.
* **Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women:** While generally safe,  pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before taking cyanocobalamin supplements, as recommended daily allowances are slightly higher during these periods.
* **Drug Interactions:** Cyanocobalamin generally does not interact significantly with other medications, but it's still essential to inform healthcare providers of all medications being taken to prevent potential issues.
* **Kidney Impairment:** Individuals with severely impaired kidney function may require dosage adjustments because the body may not be able to effectively process excess cyanocobalamin.
* **Liver Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are not typically needed for liver impairment but should be discussed with a physician.
* **Folate Deficiency:**  High doses of cyanocobalamin can mask the symptoms of folate deficiency.  It is important to rule out folate deficiency before beginning treatment.
* **Leber's Disease:** Use with caution in individuals with early Leber's disease.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take cyanocobalamin if I'm already taking a multivitamin containing B12?** A:  It's advisable to discuss this with a healthcare professional, especially if you suspect or have been diagnosed with a B12 deficiency. Taking high doses of B12 without medical supervision is not recommended.

* **Q: How should I store cyanocobalamin?** A:  Store according to the label instructions, typically at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Is cyanocobalamin safe for long-term use?** A:  When used under the guidance of a healthcare professional to treat a deficiency, long-term use is often necessary to maintain adequate levels.  However, regular monitoring is important.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it is near the time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: Are there any other forms of vitamin B12?** A: Yes, there are other forms, such as hydroxocobalamin and methylcobalamin.  These may be more suitable for certain conditions or individual preferences, but the choice of B12 form should be made in conjunction with a physician.

* **Q:  How long does it take to see results from Cyanocobalamin treatment?** A: This depends on the severity of the deficiency and the treatment approach. Some improvement might be seen within weeks, while significant improvement may take longer, potentially months.
