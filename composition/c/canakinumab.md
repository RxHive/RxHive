# Canakinumab
### Generic Name
Canakinumab

### Usage
Canakinumab is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat several rare, inherited inflammatory conditions known as periodic fever syndromes.  These include:

* **Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS):** This group encompasses familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID).  These syndromes cause recurring episodes of fever, rash, and joint pain.
* **Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS):** TRAPS is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, rash, and abdominal pain.
* **Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD):** HIDS/MKD is marked by recurring fevers, rash, and inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF):** FMF is a hereditary condition causing attacks of fever, abdominal pain, and chest pain.
* **Active Still's disease:** This encompasses both adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), causing symptoms such as high fever, rash, joint pain, and inflammation of internal organs.


While not its primary indication, Canakinumab has also been used off-label in the treatment of acute gout flares in certain situations.  This is usually reserved for individuals with frequent, debilitating flares who haven't responded well to other treatments.

### Dosage

Canakinumab is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) as an injection.  Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's weight, and their response to the medication.  Precise dosing instructions must come directly from a healthcare provider.  The following information is for general knowledge only and should not be considered a substitute for medical advice.


**Adults:**

* **CAPS:**  >40 kg: 150 mg every 8 weeks; 15-40 kg: 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks (potentially increased to 3 mg/kg if needed).
* **TRAPS/FMF/HIDS/MKD:** >40 kg: 150 mg every 4 weeks (potentially increased to 300 mg if needed); ≤40 kg: 2 mg/kg every 4 weeks (potentially increased to 4 mg/kg if needed).
* **AOSD:** 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks, up to a maximum of 300 mg per dose.
* **Acute Gout Flare (Off-label):** 150 mg as a single dose.


**Children:**  Dosage for children is significantly weight-based and varies depending on the specific condition and age.  Always follow the instructions provided by your child's healthcare provider.  The information below is not a substitute for their professional guidance.  Dosage for children younger than 2 years old is not established for all conditions.


**General Considerations for All Ages:**  Before starting Canakinumab, patients should undergo testing for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection.  Healthcare providers will need to monitor for potential side effects and adjust dosages accordingly.

### How it Works

Canakinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and neutralizes interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β).  IL-1β is a protein that plays a significant role in inflammation.  By blocking the action of IL-1β, Canakinumab reduces inflammation, thereby alleviating the symptoms of the conditions it treats.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Canakinumab is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components and those with active, severe infections.
* **Interactions:**  The use of Canakinumab with other medications, particularly other biologic agents such as TNF-blockers or other IL-1 inhibitors, may increase the risk of serious infections and neutropenia (low neutrophil count).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Canakinumab is a Pregnancy Category C medication. The safety of Canakinumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Discussions with a healthcare provider are crucial before using this medication if pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Infections:**  Canakinumab increases the risk of infections.  Patients should be up-to-date on their vaccinations before starting therapy and should report any signs of infection to their doctor immediately.  Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with Canakinumab.
* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with pre-existing conditions that increase infection risk should be closely monitored.  Regular blood tests are usually recommended to monitor blood cell counts and other important parameters.
