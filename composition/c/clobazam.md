# Clobazam
### Generic Name
Clobazam

### Usage
Clobazam is primarily used as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients aged 2 years and older.  This means it's used *in addition* to other anti-seizure medications, not as a standalone treatment.  While its primary use is for LGS, clobazam is also sometimes used off-label (meaning it's not officially approved for this purpose but is sometimes prescribed by doctors) for other seizure disorders, particularly those that are treatment-resistant (meaning other medications haven't been effective).  Another off-label use is in managing catamenial epilepsy, where seizures worsen around menstruation.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the patient's age, weight, and the specific condition being treated.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's precise instructions.  Here's a summary, but this is *not* a substitute for personalized medical advice:

**Adults (Seizures associated with LGS):**

* **Patients weighing >30 kg:** The initial dose is typically 10 mg daily, divided into two doses. This can be gradually increased to 20 mg daily after a week, and then to 40 mg daily after another week, depending on the patient's response and tolerance.
* **Patients weighing ≤ 30 kg:** The initial dose is typically 5 mg daily, which may be increased to 10 mg daily after a week, and then 20 mg daily after another week, based on response and tolerance.
* **CYP2C19 poor metabolizers:** These individuals require a slower titration schedule starting with lower doses.  A doctor will provide specific instructions.

**Adults (Treatment-refractory seizures – off-label):**

* The initial dose is usually between 5-15 mg/day, gradually increased to 40 mg/day (or potentially up to 80 mg/day in some cases), depending on response and tolerance.  Higher doses are usually divided throughout the day.

**Pediatric Dosage (Seizures associated with LGS):**

* **Children aged ≥ 2 years:** Dosage is similar to that of adults, adjusted for weight.
* **Children aged < 2 years:**  The safety and effectiveness of clobazam have not been established in this age group.  Use only under strict medical supervision.
* **Generalized or partial seizures (off-label):**  Dosages are typically lower, starting at 0.5-1 mg/kg/day in divided doses. The maximum daily dose is usually limited to 10 mg/day in children under 2 and up to 40mg/day for children aged 2-16.


**Dosage Forms:** Clobazam is available in tablets, oral film, and oral suspension (liquid).  Administration instructions vary based on the form. Always follow the directions provided with your prescription.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment or for older adults.  These adjustments should be made under strict medical supervision.

**Important Note:**  Never change your dosage or stop taking clobazam without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to serious withdrawal symptoms.

### How it Works

Clobazam is a benzodiazepine that works by enhancing the effects of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), a neurotransmitter in the brain that inhibits nerve impulses.  By increasing GABA's activity, clobazam helps reduce the excessive neuronal excitability that causes seizures. It binds to specific receptors in the brain, leading to a calming effect.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Clobazam is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to clobazam or its components, myasthenia gravis, severe hepatic or respiratory disease, narrow-angle glaucoma, sleep apnea, and a history of substance abuse. It should also not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy or during breastfeeding.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Clobazam can interact with many other medications, including other sedatives, opioids, and certain antidepressants.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Clobazam is a Category C pregnancy medication, meaning its potential risks to a developing fetus are unknown. Use during pregnancy should only occur when the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Clobazam is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is generally not advised during treatment.

* **Older Adults:** Older adults are more susceptible to the sedative effects of clobazam and may require lower doses.

* **Children:**  Use in children under 2 years old should only be done under strict medical supervision due to a lack of sufficient data on safety and effectiveness.

* **Alcohol and other CNS Depressants:**  Avoid alcohol and other central nervous system depressants while taking clobazam as they can intensify its sedative effects.

* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Clobazam can impair cognitive function and coordination.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for clobazam to start working?** A: The onset of effect varies, but you might notice some improvement within a few days to weeks.  It often takes several weeks to reach the full therapeutic effect.

* **Q: Can I stop taking clobazam suddenly?** A: No.  Abruptly stopping clobazam can lead to withdrawal symptoms, which can be serious.  Always taper off the medication under your doctor's supervision.

* **Q: How should I store clobazam?** A: Store clobazam at room temperature, away from light and moisture.  Follow the specific storage instructions on your prescription label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I take clobazam with other medications?** A: It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: Is clobazam addictive?** A: Like other benzodiazepines, clobazam carries a risk of dependence with prolonged use.  Your doctor will monitor you for signs of dependence and help you manage this risk.  It’s important to only take it as prescribed.
