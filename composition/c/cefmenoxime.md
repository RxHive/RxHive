# Cefmenoxime
### Generic Name
Cefmenoxime

### Usage

Cefmenoxime is a broad-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic.  Its primary use was in treating various bacterial infections, particularly those affecting the gynecological and obstetrical systems. This included infections caused by both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.  It was also used to treat infections of the ear (otitis externa, otitis media) and sinuses (sinusitis).  It's important to note that Cefmenoxime is no longer available in the United States.

### Dosage

**Note:**  Dosage information provided here is for historical reference only, as Cefmenoxime is no longer marketed in the US.  Do not attempt to obtain or use this medication without a prescription and guidance from a healthcare professional.

The dosage of Cefmenoxime varied depending on the infection's severity, the patient's age, and renal function.  It was typically administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM).

* **Adults:** For susceptible infections, the usual dosage was 1-4 grams per day, divided into 2-4 doses.  In severe infections, the maximum daily dose could reach 9 grams.

* **Children:** Dosages for children were weight-based.  Neonates (newborns) might receive 40-60 mg/kg/day in 2-3 divided doses, while older children might receive 40-80 mg/kg/day in 2-4 divided doses.  

* **Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal impairment significantly impacted Cefmenoxime dosage.  Lower doses and less frequent administration were necessary for patients with reduced kidney function.  Dosage adjustments were also needed for patients undergoing hemodialysis.  Hepatic impairment did not generally require dosage adjustment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of Cefmenoxime included:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Pain at the injection site (with IM administration)
* Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein, with IV administration)

Less common but serious side effects included:

* Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage)
* Convulsions (seizures)
* Central nervous system toxicity
* Hepatic dysfunction (liver problems)
* Hematologic disorders (blood disorders)
* Pseudomembranous colitis (a severe intestinal infection)
* Superinfection (new infection developing during treatment)


If you experience any adverse effects while taking Cefmenoxime (or any medication), contact a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Cefmenoxime, like other cephalosporins, is a beta-lactam antibiotic. It works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.  Specifically, it binds to and inactivates bacterial enzymes called transpeptidases, which are essential for the final step in building the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall.  Without a functioning cell wall, bacteria cannot survive.  Cefmenoxime's resistance to certain beta-lactamases (enzymes produced by bacteria to break down beta-lactam antibiotics) contributes to its broad-spectrum activity.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cefmenoxime was contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to cephalosporin antibiotics.

* **Warnings:**  Caution was advised in patients with a history of penicillin allergy (as cross-reactivity can occur), renal impairment, or porphyria (a genetic disorder affecting heme production).

* **Interactions:**  Probenecid reduced the renal clearance of Cefmenoxime, potentially leading to higher blood levels and increased risk of side effects.  Alcohol consumption could cause disulfiram-like reactions (similar to those seen with Antabuse).


* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Cefmenoxime during pregnancy and breastfeeding was not fully established.
