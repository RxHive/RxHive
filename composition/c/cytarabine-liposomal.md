# Cytarabine (Liposomal)
### Generic Name
Cytarabine (Liposomal)

### Usage
Cytarabine (liposomal) is primarily used for the intrathecal (directly into the cerebrospinal fluid) treatment of lymphomatous meningitis.  This is a type of cancer that affects the lining of the brain and spinal cord.  It's a targeted treatment designed to reach the cancer cells within the cerebrospinal fluid, where systemic chemotherapy might not be effective.  This formulation is not intended for other types of cancer or other conditions.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  The dosage regimen for lymphomatous meningitis involves intrathecal administration.  It's crucial to note that dexamethasone (4 mg twice daily, orally or intravenously) should be given for five days, starting on the day Cytarabine (liposomal) is administered.

* **Induction:** 50 mg every 14 days for a total of 2 doses (weeks 1 and 3).
* **Consolidation:** 50 mg every 14 days for 3 doses (weeks 5, 7, and 9), followed by an additional dose at week 13.
* **Maintenance:** 50 mg every 28 days for 4 doses (weeks 17, 21, 25, and 29).

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Cytarabine (liposomal) in children haven't been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, for neurotoxicity (problems affecting the nervous system), the dose may be reduced to 25 mg. If toxicity persists, treatment should be stopped.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Nervous system: Headache, confusion, fatigue, abnormal gait, dizziness, lethargy, insomnia, memory impairment, pain, chemical arachnoiditis.
* Cardiovascular: Peripheral edema.
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, decreased appetite.
* Endocrine and metabolic: Dehydration.
* Genitourinary: Urinary tract infection.
* Hematologic: Anemia, thrombocytopenia.
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Weakness, back pain, limb pain, neck pain, arthralgia, neck stiffness.
* Ophthalmic: Blurred vision.
* Other: Fever.


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10% or less):**  A wide range of less frequent side effects have been reported, including but not limited to agitation, hypoesthesia, myasthenia, depression, anxiety, various types of neuropathy, cardiovascular issues (tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, syncope, edema), various gastrointestinal problems, dermatological issues, electrolyte imbalances, hematologic abnormalities, respiratory issues, and others.


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  Serious side effects, although rare, include anaphylaxis, bladder problems, blindness, brain disease, cauda equina syndrome, cranial nerve palsies, deafness, drowsiness, fecal incontinence, hemiplegia, hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure,  meningitis (infectious), myelopathy, other neurological deficits, numbness, papilledema, and visual disturbances.  Seek immediate medical attention if any serious side effects occur.


### How it Works
Cytarabine (liposomal) is a sustained-release version of cytarabine, an antimetabolite that disrupts DNA synthesis.  It's cell-cycle specific, meaning it primarily targets cells undergoing DNA replication (S-phase). Cytarabine is converted into its active form, ara-CTP, which inhibits DNA polymerase, preventing DNA synthesis and repair.  The liposomal formulation provides a slow, controlled release of the drug, prolonging its effects.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cytarabine (liposomal) is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to cytarabine or any formulation component, and those with active meningeal infections.
* **Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of chemical arachnoiditis (inflammation of the arachnoid membrane), transient increases in cerebrospinal fluid protein and white blood cell counts, and neurotoxicity (including myelopathy).
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Conventional cytarabine has been linked to fetal malformations during the first trimester. While systemic exposure after intrathecal administration is minimal, women of childbearing age should avoid pregnancy during treatment.  The excretion in breast milk is unknown; a decision to discontinue breastfeeding or treatment should be made considering the mother's health needs.
* **Other:**  Proper handling, storage, preparation, and disposal procedures must be followed.  Intrathecal administration requires careful technique, slow injection, and post-injection monitoring for immediate reactions.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Cytarabine (liposomal) administered?** A: It is administered intrathecally (directly into the cerebrospinal fluid) via lumbar puncture or an intraventricular reservoir.

* **Q: How long does treatment typically last?** A: The treatment duration varies based on the treatment phase (induction, consolidation, maintenance) and individual response.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects to your healthcare provider immediately. Some side effects may require dose adjustment or treatment discontinuation.

* **Q: How should Cytarabine (liposomal) be stored?** A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.

* **Q: Is Cytarabine (liposomal) safe for everyone?** A: No.  It has contraindications and precautions, particularly for pregnant women, individuals with certain medical conditions, and those with hypersensitivity to cytarabine.  Always consult with your doctor before starting treatment.
