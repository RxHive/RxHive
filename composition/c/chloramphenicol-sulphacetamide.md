# Chloramphenicol + Sulphacetamide
### Generic Name
Chloramphenicol + Sulphacetamide

**Note:**  Chloramphenicol and Sulphacetamide are often combined in ophthalmic (eye) preparations.  This information pertains to that specific combination.  Individual use of Chloramphenicol or Sulphacetamide may have different indications, dosages, and side effects. Always refer to the specific product labeling for complete information.


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat bacterial infections of the eye, such as conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and other bacterial inflammations of the eyelids and surrounding structures.  It's effective against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.  The Chloramphenicol component acts as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, while Sulphacetamide provides additional antibacterial action, particularly against certain gram-negative bacteria. This synergistic effect broadens the spectrum of bacterial infections it can effectively target.  It is important to note that this combination is specifically for *external* eye use and should *never* be ingested.

### Dosage

Dosage is strictly determined by a physician based on the specific infection and the individual's condition.  Generally, for ophthalmic use, the medication is applied as eye drops or ointment.  The typical regimen involves instilling one or two drops in the affected eye(s) every 2-4 hours or applying a small amount of ointment several times a day.  The frequency and duration of treatment will vary.  **Children's dosage should be determined solely by a pediatrician or ophthalmologist.**  There are no IV formulations of this specific combination.

**Important Note:**  Never exceed the prescribed dosage.  Improper use can lead to complications.

### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Burning, stinging, or temporary blurred vision upon application.  Mild irritation or redness.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Allergic reactions (such as rash, itching, swelling), eye pain, increased discharge, persistent redness, or vision changes.  In rare instances, Chloramphenicol can cause aplastic anemia (a severe blood disorder), though this is much rarer with topical application.
* **If you experience any of the above side effects, contact your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.**


### How it Works

Chloramphenicol interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, preventing bacteria from producing essential proteins necessary for growth and survival.  Sulphacetamide inhibits the synthesis of folic acid, a vital nutrient for bacterial growth. By targeting different steps in bacterial metabolic pathways, the combination effectively combats a wider range of bacteria than either drug would alone. This combined action reduces the chance of bacterial resistance.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Known allergies to chloramphenicol, sulphacetamide, or any components of the formulation.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using this medication.
* **Drug Interactions:**  The interaction of this topical medication with other drugs is generally low; however, inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you're taking.
* **Warnings:** Avoid touching the tip of the dropper or ointment tube to any surface to prevent contamination.  Do not wear contact lenses while using this medication, unless otherwise instructed by your doctor.  If symptoms worsen or don't improve after a few days, seek medical attention.  Prolonged use could increase the risk of developing resistant bacteria.
