# Chlorthalidone
### Generic Name
Chlorthalidone

### Usage
Chlorthalidone is primarily used as a diuretic (water pill) to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by helping the kidneys remove excess salt and water from the body, thus lowering blood pressure.  It's also used as an adjunctive therapy (in addition to other treatments) for edema (swelling) associated with conditions like congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and treatments with corticosteroids or estrogen.  While not its primary use, it may also be used off-label in certain situations like preventing calcium kidney stones or managing some aspects of hypoparathyroidism.  Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate use of chlorthalidone in your specific case.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The dosage of chlorthalidone varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the individual's response.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Edema:**  Initial doses range from 50-100 mg once daily or 100 mg every other day, with a maximum daily dose of 200 mg.  For refractory edema (edema that doesn't respond well to treatment), lower starting doses (12.5-25 mg daily) are often used, increasing gradually as needed, up to a maximum of 100mg/day.

* **Hypertension:** Initial doses typically range from 12.5-25 mg once daily, potentially increasing to 50 mg daily.  The usual maintenance dose is between 12.5-25mg daily, with a maximum daily dose of 100mg.

* **Off-label uses:**  Dosage for conditions like preventing calcium kidney stones or managing hypoparathyroidism are determined on a case-by-case basis by your physician and will vary based on individual needs and response.


**Pediatric Dosage:** Use in children is less common and should only be undertaken under strict medical supervision. Dosage is determined by weight and condition.  Typically, for hypertension in children and adolescents, the starting dose is 0.3 mg/kg/day, with a maximum dose of 2 mg/kg/day or 50 mg/day, whichever is lower.  For peripheral edema in children aged 2-12, the dosage is 1-2 mg/kg/day.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Kidney function significantly impacts chlorthalidone dosage.  If your kidney function is impaired, your doctor will need to adjust the dosage or possibly discontinue the medication.  For those with liver impairment, careful monitoring is necessary, and dosage adjustments are not typically specified in manufacturer labeling.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Lightheadedness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach upset
* Muscle cramps
* Dehydration

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include:

*  Low potassium levels (hypokalemia) â€“ this can be life-threatening and needs immediate medical attention.
*  Low sodium levels (hyponatremia)
*  High blood sugar (hyperglycemia)
*  High uric acid levels (hyperuricemia), which can worsen gout
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Jaundice
* Pancreatitis


**If you experience any side effects, particularly serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic. It works by increasing the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the kidneys.  This reduces blood volume and subsequently lowers blood pressure.  The reduced blood volume also contributes to the relief of edema.  The exact mechanism by which it lowers blood pressure isn't fully understood but involves multiple pathways in the kidneys and blood vessels.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Chlorthalidone is contraindicated in individuals with an allergy to sulfonamides (including chlorthalidone itself) and those with anuria (lack of urine production).

* **Interactions:** Chlorthalidone can interact with many other medications, including those used to treat diabetes, gout, and high cholesterol. It can also interact with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and alcohol.  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Particular caution should be exercised in individuals with liver or kidney disease, diabetes, gout, or a history of electrolyte imbalances.  Chlorthalidone can cause electrolyte abnormalities (such as low potassium), and monitoring of these is crucial.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before taking this medication.  The use of chlorthalidone in children should only be done under the close supervision of a pediatrician.  Older adults are more susceptible to the side effects and require close monitoring.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking chlorthalidone?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking chlorthalidone, as it can increase the risk of dehydration and low blood pressure.

* **Q:  How should I store chlorthalidone?** A: Store chlorthalidone at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to catch up.

* **Q: Can I stop taking chlorthalidone suddenly?** A: No, you should never stop taking chlorthalidone suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can cause a rebound effect, leading to a sudden increase in blood pressure.
