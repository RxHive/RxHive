# Chlorprothixene
### Generic Name
Chlorprothixene

### Usage

Chlorprothixene is a typical antipsychotic medication belonging to the thioxanthene class.  Its primary use is in the treatment of psychotic disorders, most notably schizophrenia.  It's also effective in managing acute mania, a phase of bipolar disorder characterized by elevated mood, racing thoughts, and impulsive behavior.  While primarily used for these conditions,  a physician might consider it for other uses based on individual patient needs.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the individual, their condition's severity, age, and response to treatment.  Always follow a doctor's prescription precisely.

**Adults:**

* **Psychoses (oral):**  Treatment typically begins with 25-50 mg three or four times daily. The daily dose can be increased, up to 600mg or more if needed, to achieve the best therapeutic effect.  However, higher doses require careful monitoring.  Elderly patients may require a lower dose.
* **Psychoses (intramuscular):**  25-50mg as needed, although this may be adjusted upward, generally not exceeding 200 mg daily. Intramuscular administration is usually temporary, transitioning to oral medication as soon as feasible.  Elderly patients may require lower doses.

**Children:**

* **Psychoses (oral):**  The safety and effectiveness of oral chlorprothixene haven't been established for children under 6. For children aged 6-12, the starting dose is usually 10-25 mg three or four times a day.
* **Psychoses (intramuscular):** The safety and effectiveness of intramuscular chlorprothixene haven't been established for children under 12. For those 12 and older, the dosage may be similar to adults, but this must be determined by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment; however, caution is warranted in these cases.


### Side Effects

Chlorprothixene, like many medications, can cause side effects. Common ones include:

* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Urinary retention
* Blurred vision
* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Agitation
* Insomnia
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Postural hypotension (a drop in blood pressure when standing)
*  Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as muscle stiffness, tremors, restlessness, and difficulty with movement.
*  Nasal congestion

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Severe allergic reactions
* Agranulocytosis (a dangerous drop in white blood cells)
* Seizures
* Jaundice
* Severe skin reactions

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Chlorprothixene primarily works by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter implicated in schizophrenia and mania. By reducing dopamine activity in specific brain regions, chlorprothixene helps alleviate psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, as well as the mood instability associated with mania.  It also affects other neurotransmitters and systems in the body, contributing to its overall effects.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Chlorprothixene is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, coma, CNS depression, pheochromocytoma, circulatory collapse, severe cardiovascular disease, concomitant use of drugs prolonging QT interval, malignant neuroleptic syndrome, and uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.
* **Interactions:** Chlorprothixene can interact with several other medications, including lithium (requiring close monitoring of lithium levels), opioids (requiring dose reduction of opioids), tramadol (contraindicated), benzodiazepines and barbiturates (additive sedative effects), and other anticholinergic drugs (potential for delirium, especially in elderly).
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, history of jaundice, cardiovascular disease, angle-closure glaucoma, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, depression, myasthenia gravis, prostatic hypertrophy, severe respiratory disease, blood dyscrasias, and breastfeeding women.  This drug is category C for pregnancy, meaning its use during pregnancy should be carefully considered.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take chlorprothixene with alcohol?**  A: No, combining chlorprothixene with alcohol is strongly discouraged due to the risk of increased sedation and other adverse effects.
* **Q: How should I store chlorprothixene?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, as directed on the packaging.
* **Q: Can I stop taking chlorprothixene suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping chlorprothixene can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually reducing the dose.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Never double up on doses.
* **Q:  Is chlorprothixene habit-forming?** A:  Chlorprothixene is not considered habit-forming in the same way as opioids, but it's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions and not discontinue the medication without their guidance.
