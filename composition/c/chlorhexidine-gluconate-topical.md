# Chlorhexidine gluconate (Topical)
### Generic Name
Chlorhexidine Gluconate (Topical)

### Usage

Chlorhexidine gluconate topical is a broad-spectrum antiseptic used for various purposes.  Its primary use is as an antimicrobial agent to prevent and treat acne.  It's also commonly used for:

* **Preoperative skin preparation:**  Cleaning the skin before surgery to reduce the risk of infection.
* **Wound care and general skin cleansing:**  Treating minor wounds like cuts, scrapes, burns, and abrasions, as well as cleansing generally infected skin.
* **Surgical scrub and antiseptic hand rinse:**  Used by healthcare professionals to sterilize hands and forearms before surgical procedures.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific application and formulation (gel, lotion, cream, solution). Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or the product labeling.  Here's a summary:

**Acne Treatment and Prevention:**

* **Gel (0.5%), Lotion (1%):** Apply twice daily (morning and evening) to affected areas.

**Antiseptic Uses (Surgical scrub, handwash, preoperative skin prep, wound care):**

Dosage instructions for antiseptic uses are highly variable depending on the product and intended use.  See the detailed instructions below for examples. Always adhere to the specific instructions on the product packaging or as directed by a healthcare professional.

* **Surgical Scrub:** Typically involves scrubbing hands and forearms for a specific duration (often 3-5 minutes) with a specified amount (e.g., ~5 mL) of solution, paying close attention to nails and interdigital spaces. Thorough rinsing is crucial.
* **Hand Antiseptic:** Application varies depending on the formulation. Some require a 15-second wash and rinse with a specific volume.
* **Preoperative Skin Preparation:**  Liberal application to the surgical site, often requiring multiple applications and allowing adequate drying time before surgery, especially if electrocautery is used. Drying times can vary significantly based on hair and moisture presence at the surgical site.
* **Wound Care and General Skin Cleansing:** Apply a minimal amount to cover the affected area, washing gently and rinsing thoroughly afterward.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Use in infants under 2 months old should be approached with caution due to the potential for irritation or chemical burns.  Preoperative skin preparation and wound cleansing in older children generally follow similar protocols as in adults, but always consult a pediatrician for specific guidance.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and include:

* Skin irritation (erythema, dryness)
* Allergic reactions (rare but potentially serious)

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Facial edema (swelling of the face)
* Nasal congestion

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed above, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Chlorhexidine gluconate is a cationic antiseptic that disrupts bacterial cell membranes.  It binds to negatively charged bacterial cell walls, altering their permeability and disrupting cellular functions. At lower concentrations, this action is bacteriostatic (inhibits bacterial growth); at higher concentrations, it's bactericidal (kills bacteria).  It's also effective against some fungi (yeasts).


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Do not use if you are allergic to chlorhexidine or any component of the formulation.
* **Hypersensitivity:** A serious allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, is possible.
* **Premature Neonates and Infants <2 Months:** Use with extreme caution due to increased risk of irritation.
* **Eyes and Ears:** Avoid contact with eyes and ears.
* **Flammable:** Some formulations may be flammable; avoid open flames until completely dry.
* **Staining:** Chlorhexidine can stain fabrics (brown stain).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe, consult your doctor before using chlorhexidine during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Currently no significant interactions are documented, but inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store chlorhexidine gluconate?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effect is relatively immediate as an antiseptic, providing immediate antimicrobial activity, however, acne treatment takes time to show results.
