# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide
### Generic Name
Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, influenza (the flu), and other upper respiratory infections.  It's a dual-action formulation addressing both the runny nose/sneezing and the cough.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine that works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.  In this combination, it helps to dry up nasal secretions.

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This is a cough suppressant (antitussive). It works in the brain to reduce the urge to cough. It's most effective for coughs that are dry and non-productive (not bringing up mucus).  It doesn't treat the underlying cause of the cough, but rather the symptom itself.


This combination is typically not recommended for treating coughs associated with excessive mucus production (productive coughs) or coughs caused by conditions such as whooping cough or bronchitis, where a different approach to treatment might be necessary.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific product formulation (tablet, syrup, etc.), the age of the patient, and the severity of symptoms. Always follow the instructions on the product label carefully or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.  **Never exceed the recommended dosage.**

* **Adults and Children 12 years and older:**  Dosage will vary depending on the specific product formulation. Carefully read the product label.

**Oral Administration:** Tablets or syrups should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. For syrups, use the provided measuring device to ensure accurate dosage.

### How it Works

As explained in the "Usage" section, this medication is a combination of an antihistamine (chlorpheniramine) and a cough suppressant (dextromethorphan). Chlorpheniramine works by blocking histamine receptors, reducing the symptoms of a runny nose and sneezing. Dextromethorphan works in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.  Together, they alleviate common cold and flu symptoms.
