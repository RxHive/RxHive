**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes.

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This is a cough suppressant (antitussive). It works in the brain to reduce the cough reflex.  It is *not* effective for treating coughs with mucus (productive coughs).
