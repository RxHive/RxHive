# Calcium Carbonate + Magnesium Hydroxide + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Vitamin D

**Generic Name:** Calcium Carbonate + Magnesium Hydroxide + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (Cholecalciferol)  *(Note:  The specific salts and vitamin D form may vary slightly depending on the manufacturer.)*


**Usage:** This combination is typically used as a dietary supplement to address deficiencies or insufficient intake of calcium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D.  It's often recommended for:

* **Osteoporosis prevention and treatment:** Calcium and vitamin D are crucial for bone health. Magnesium also plays a supporting role.
* **Improving bone density:**  All four components contribute to stronger bones.
* **Supporting immune function:** Zinc and vitamin D are vital for a healthy immune system.
* **Addressing deficiencies:**  This supplement helps correct deficiencies in these essential nutrients.
* **Muscle function:** Calcium and magnesium are key for muscle contraction and relaxation.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and infrequent but can include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, stomach upset (especially with high doses).
* **Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium):**  Rare, but possible with excessive intake. Symptoms can include fatigue, weakness, constipation, kidney stones.
* **Hypermagnesemia (high blood magnesium):**  Rare, usually seen with kidney impairment. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, weakness, low blood pressure.
* **Zinc toxicity:**  Rare, usually only with excessive doses. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps.
* **Vitamin D toxicity (hypervitaminosis D):** Rare, but can lead to high blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia) with prolonged high doses.


**How it Works:**

* **Calcium Carbonate:** Provides calcium, essential for bone health, muscle function, and nerve transmission. It's absorbed better with stomach acid.
* **Magnesium Hydroxide:** Supplies magnesium, important for bone health, muscle function, nerve function, and blood sugar control.  It also acts as a mild laxative.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:**  Provides zinc, a crucial mineral for immune function, wound healing, and enzyme activity.
* **Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (Cholecalciferol):**  A fat-soluble vitamin that aids in calcium absorption from the gut, promoting bone mineralization and supporting immune function.
