# Chlorhexidine Gluconate + Metronidazole

**Generic Name:** Chlorhexidine Gluconate + Metronidazole

**Usage:** This combination is typically used topically for the treatment of gingivitis (gum inflammation) and periodontitis (gum disease) associated with plaque and gingivitis caused by susceptible microorganisms. It may be prescribed as a mouthwash or gel.  Specific formulations and strengths may vary depending on the manufacturer and the intended use.  **Always follow the prescribed usage instructions provided by your dentist or healthcare professional.** Do not use this medication without professional guidance.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the formulation and individual sensitivity, but common ones include:

* **Mouth:** Altered taste (dysgeusia), burning sensation, staining of teeth (especially with prolonged use), dry mouth.
* **Other:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), nausea.  Rarely, more serious side effects can occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Chlorhexidine Gluconate:** This is a broad-spectrum antiseptic that works by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane, leading to cell death. It's effective against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as some fungi.

* **Metronidazole:** This is an antimicrobial agent that interferes with the DNA of susceptible microorganisms, preventing their growth and reproduction. It is particularly effective against anaerobic bacteria, which often contribute to gum disease.

The combination of these two active ingredients provides a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity, targeting both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria involved in periodontal disease.
