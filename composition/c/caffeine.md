# Caffeine
### Generic Name
Caffeine

### Usage
Caffeine is primarily used to treat apnea of prematurity, a condition where premature infants experience pauses in breathing.  It acts as a central nervous system stimulant, increasing the respiratory drive and improving muscle contractions involved in breathing.  Off-label uses include augmentation of seizure induction during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), reversal of adverse reactions to certain cardiac stress test medications (dipyridamole or regadenoson), and treatment of post-dural puncture headache.  These off-label uses are supported by clinical experience but lack the same level of rigorous scientific evidence as its primary use in apnea of prematurity.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the indication and the patient's age and overall health.  Always follow the instructions provided by a healthcare professional.

**Adult Dosage:**

* **CNS Stimulation (over-the-counter):** 100-200 mg of caffeine base every 3-4 hours as needed, orally.
* **ECT Augmentation (off-label):** 500-1000 mg of caffeine and sodium benzoate (equivalent to 250-500 mg caffeine base) intravenously as an initial dose.  Subsequent doses may be adjusted.
* **Cardiac Stress Test Reversal (off-label):** 60 mg of caffeine citrate intravenously over 3-5 minutes.
* **Post-Dural Puncture Headache (off-label):** 500 mg of caffeine and sodium benzoate (equivalent to 250 mg caffeine base) intravenously, followed by additional fluids.  A second dose might be administered if necessary.  Oral doses of 300 mg caffeine base as a single dose have also been used.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **CNS Stimulation (over-the-counter; children â‰¥12 years):** 100-200 mg of caffeine base every 3-4 hours as needed, orally.  **Important Note:**  Caffeine use in children younger than 12 requires strict medical supervision due to potential side effects and the need for precise dosage adjustment based on weight and other factors.  


**Important Note:** Caffeine citrate and caffeine and sodium benzoate formulations are *not* interchangeable.  The dosage instructions above reflect this distinction where applicable.

### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Nervous system effects: Agitation, anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, headache, dizziness, tremors, irritability.
* Cardiovascular effects: Increased heart rate (tachycardia), palpitations, high blood pressure (in some cases).
* Gastrointestinal effects: Upset stomach, nausea.
* Other:  Increased urination (diuresis).


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:  hallucinations, seizures, irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias),  and severe gastrointestinal issues.   Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Caffeine works by blocking the effects of adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep and relaxation. By inhibiting adenosine, caffeine increases activity in the central nervous system, stimulating alertness and increasing respiratory drive.  In the case of apnea of prematurity, this increased respiratory drive helps prevent breathing pauses.  The mechanism of action varies slightly depending on the specific indication for its use.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Caffeine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to caffeine or any formulation component, and  neonates (sodium benzoate is contraindicated in neonates).
* **Drug Interactions:** Caffeine can interact with numerous medications. Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with a healthcare provider before using caffeine.  Interactions can significantly affect the effectiveness and safety of both caffeine and other drugs.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Caffeine use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered due to potential risks to the developing fetus and infant.  Consult a healthcare professional before using caffeine if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Other Precautions:**  Use caution in patients with liver or kidney problems, heart conditions, anxiety disorders, peptic ulcers, or gastroesophageal reflux disease.
