# Cefixime + Levofloxacin
### Generic Name
Cefixime + Levofloxacin  (Combination)

**Note:**  Cefixime and Levofloxacin are typically prescribed as separate medications, not always as a pre-mixed combination.  A doctor might prescribe them together for specific infections where their combined action is beneficial.  This information addresses the individual drugs and their combined use as directed by a physician.  Never take these medications together without a doctor's explicit prescription.


### Usage

This combination is primarily used to treat severe bacterial infections where a broader spectrum of antibacterial activity is needed.  The specific infections may vary depending on the doctor's assessment. Cefixime, a third-generation cephalosporin, is effective against a range of Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria. Levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, has a broader spectrum, including activity against many Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria, as well as atypical bacteria (like those causing pneumonia).  Together, they offer coverage against a wider variety of bacterial pathogens than either drug alone.  Common uses might include treating complicated urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections (such as pneumonia), and some skin and soft tissue infections when a single antibiotic isn't sufficient.


### Dosage

**Dosage must be determined and prescribed by a physician. The information below is for general understanding only and should not be used for self-medication.**

There is no standard pre-mixed combination dosage as this is usually prescribed as two separate medications.  The physician will determine the appropriate dose of each drug based on the individual's infection, age, weight, and kidney function.

* **Cefixime:** Dosages typically range from 200mg to 400mg once or twice daily for adults, depending on the infection severity.  Children's dosages are significantly lower and must be carefully calculated by a physician based on weight.  Cefixime is usually given orally (tablet or suspension).

* **Levofloxacin:** Dosages typically range from 250mg to 750mg once daily for adults, depending on the infection severity and the type of infection being treated.  Children’s dosages are weight-based and are generally not recommended due to the risk of adverse effects.  Levofloxacin is usually given orally (tablet) or intravenously (IV) depending on the severity of the illness and the patient’s ability to tolerate oral medication. IV administration requires medical supervision.


### Side Effects

**Cefixime:**

* Common: Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, rash.
* Less Common but Serious:  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), pseudomembranous colitis (severe bowel inflammation).

**Levofloxacin:**

* Common: Nausea, diarrhea, headache, dizziness.
* Less Common but Serious: Tendonitis or tendon rupture (especially in older adults or those with kidney problems), seizures, prolonged QT interval (heart rhythm disturbance), peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage).


**Combined Side Effects:**  When taken together, the likelihood of experiencing side effects from either drug, or a combination of side effects, increases. It's crucial to report any unusual symptoms immediately to your doctor.


### How it Works

Cefixime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, preventing bacteria from building and maintaining their protective outer layer.  This weakens the bacteria, making them susceptible to destruction.  Levofloxacin works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, essential enzymes for DNA replication and repair in bacteria.  By blocking these enzymes, levofloxacin prevents bacterial reproduction and leads to bacterial death.  The combined effect provides broader-spectrum antibacterial activity against a wider range of pathogens than each drug alone.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Do not take either Cefixime or Levofloxacin if you have a known allergy to cephalosporins (for Cefixime) or fluoroquinolones (for Levofloxacin) or any of their components.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Dosage adjustments are crucial for both drugs if you have impaired kidney function.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use of both drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding needs careful consideration by your physician as they may pose risks to the developing fetus or nursing infant.
* **Interactions:** These drugs can interact with other medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), antacids, and some medications metabolized by the liver.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Tendinitis/Tendon Rupture:** Levofloxacin carries an increased risk of tendon problems, particularly in older adults or those taking corticosteroids.
* **Other precautions:**  Avoid prolonged sun exposure during Levofloxacin treatment as it can increase photosensitivity.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this combination without a prescription?**  A: No, you should never take any medication, especially antibiotics, without a doctor's prescription.
* **Q: How long will I need to take this medication?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the type and severity of the infection and will be determined by your doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to catch up.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store both medications as directed on the label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.
