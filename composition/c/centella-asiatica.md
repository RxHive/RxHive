# Centella asiatica
### Generic Name
Centella asiatica (Gotu Kola)

### Usage
Centella asiatica, commonly known as gotu kola, is a medicinal plant used primarily for wound healing and skin conditions.  Its main application is in treating minor wounds, promoting the healing of hypertrophic wounds (raised scars), and aiding in the management of burns.  It's also been traditionally used, and in some cases studied for its potential benefits in treating conditions like psoriasis and scleroderma, though more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness in these areas.  The primary mechanism involves stimulating collagen production and fibroblast activity, essential processes in tissue repair.

### Dosage
The recommended dosage of Centella asiatica extracts is variable and depends on the specific formulation and its standardization for active compounds like asiaticoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid.  Generally, for oral administration in adults, a daily dose of 60-120mg of a standardized extract is considered typical.  However, it's crucial to follow the dosage instructions provided on the specific product you are using, as concentrations vary significantly between brands and preparations.  There is currently limited information on specific pediatric dosing, and its use in children should be under strict medical supervision.  Topical applications are also common, but the concentration and application method will vary depending on the product formulation and the condition being treated.  Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized dosage recommendations.

### Side Effects
While generally considered safe, Centella asiatica can cause some side effects, although their frequency isn't well-defined in research.  The most notable side effect is:

*   Contact dermatitis (skin irritation or allergic reaction).

If any adverse effects occur, it is important to discontinue use and seek medical advice.


### How it Works
Centella asiatica's therapeutic benefits stem from its active compounds, primarily pentacyclic triterpenes such as asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid.  These compounds stimulate fibroblast proliferation (the growth of cells that produce collagen) and increase the synthesis of collagen and fibronectin, a protein vital for tissue structure.  This enhanced collagen production and improved tissue structure accelerate wound healing and improve the tensile strength of newly formed skin.  Furthermore, Centella asiatica exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, helping to reduce the inflammatory response associated with hypertrophic scars and keloids.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Individuals with known allergies or hypersensitivity to Centella asiatica or its components should avoid using it.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Centella asiatica may have emmenagogue effects (stimulating menstruation), so its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally discouraged.  Consult a healthcare professional before use.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While limited information exists on specific drug interactions, caution is advised when using Centella asiatica concurrently with other medications.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Other:**  Always start with a low dose and gradually increase it as tolerated.  Topical applications should be tested on a small area of skin first to check for any allergic reactions.


### FAQs
