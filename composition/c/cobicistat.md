# Cobicistat
### Generic Name
Cobicistat

### Usage
Cobicistat is an antiretroviral medication used specifically to boost the effectiveness of other HIV-1 medications, atazanavir and darunavir.  It doesn't treat HIV-1 on its own; instead, it works by increasing the levels of atazanavir or darunavir in the bloodstream. This allows these primary antiretroviral drugs to more effectively suppress the HIV-1 virus.  Cobicistat is not interchangeable with ritonavir for boosting all protease inhibitors; it's specifically formulated to enhance atazanavir and darunavir.  It's always used in combination with other antiretroviral agents as part of a comprehensive HIV-1 treatment regimen.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical adult dose is 150 mg once daily. This is always taken *with* either 300 mg of atazanavir or 800 mg of darunavir, and other necessary antiretroviral medications.  The specific combination and dosage will be determined by a physician based on the patient's individual health status and treatment history.

**Children and Adolescents:** For children and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (approximately 77 lbs), the dosage is also 150 mg once daily, taken with atazanavir (300 mg).  For those weighing at least 40 kg (approximately 88 lbs) and without darunavir resistance-associated substitutions, the dose is 150 mg once daily with 800 mg of darunavir.  Again, precise dosing is always determined by a healthcare professional considering the child's weight, overall health, and HIV status.  Cobicistat is not approved for use in children weighing less than the specified weights.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be needed for patients with certain liver or kidney problems. Individuals with mild to moderate hepatic impairment generally don't require dosage changes, but  severe hepatic impairment necessitates careful consideration, and a physician's guidance is crucial.  If a patient is also taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and has a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of less than 70 mL/min, Cobicistat is usually not recommended.  For patients *not* taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, no dosage adjustment is typically necessary regardless of renal function.  Always consult with a doctor for personalized dosage recommendations.  

Cobicistat is administered orally as a tablet.  It should be taken with food at the same time as the boosted protease inhibitor.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Abnormal dreams
* Depression
* Fatigue
* Insomnia
* Diarrhea
* Upper abdominal pain
* Vomiting
* Skin rash
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT)
* Increased bilirubin levels

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Jaundice
*   Increased serum creatine kinase
*   Rhabdomyolysis
*   Proximal tubular nephropathy
*   Nephrolithiasis
*   Renal insufficiency
*   Decreased neutrophil count
*   Fanconi's syndrome
*   Hyperglycemia
*   Hyperlipidemia (increased cholesterol and triglycerides)

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the less common serious ones, it's vital to seek medical advice immediately.

### How it Works

Cobicistat is a cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitor.  CYP3A is an enzyme in the liver that breaks down many medications, including atazanavir and darunavir. By inhibiting CYP3A, Cobicistat prevents the rapid breakdown of these drugs, leading to higher and more sustained levels in the bloodstream.  These increased drug levels allow for better viral suppression.  It is crucial to understand that Cobicistat itself does *not* directly fight HIV-1; its role is purely to enhance the activity of other antiretroviral drugs.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cobicistat is contraindicated with various medications due to potential dangerous interactions.  Never take Cobicistat with these medications without explicit physician approval.  A complete list is available from prescribing information or a healthcare professional.  
* **Drug Interactions:** Cobicistat interacts with many other drugs.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to prevent potentially dangerous interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While Cobicistat is categorized as Pregnancy Category B,  its use during pregnancy requires careful monitoring by a physician.  Breastfeeding is not recommended for women with HIV due to the risk of viral transmission.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with liver or kidney problems. Close monitoring of renal function is particularly important when Cobicistat is co-administered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.
* **Immune Reconstitution Syndrome:** Patients may experience immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS) as their immune system recovers.
* **Other Important Considerations:**  Cobicistat should be administered with food and at the same time as atazanavir or darunavir. Using Cobicistat with HIV-1 protease inhibitors other than atazanavir or darunavir administered once daily is generally not recommended.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Cobicistat alone to treat HIV?** A: No. Cobicistat must be used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, specifically atazanavir or darunavir, as part of a complete HIV-1 treatment regimen.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose. Contact your doctor if you have concerns about missed doses.

* **Q: How should I store Cobicistat?** A: Store Cobicistat at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of taking Cobicistat?** A: Long-term effects are not fully known, but regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is crucial to detect and manage any potential issues.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Cobicistat if I feel better?** A: No. Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to the development of drug resistance and treatment failure.  Your doctor should always determine when and how to stop therapy.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed treatment plan.
