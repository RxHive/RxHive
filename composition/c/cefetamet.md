# Cefetamet

**Generic Name:** Cefetamet pivoxil

**Usage:**

Cefetamet pivoxil is an oral cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, primarily in the respiratory and skin/skin structure areas.  Specific infections treated may include:

* Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis
* Community-acquired pneumonia
* Skin and skin structure infections (e.g., cellulitis, abscesses)

It's important to note that cefetamet pivoxil is *not* effective against all types of bacteria, and its use should be guided by a doctor's prescription and based on bacterial susceptibility testing whenever possible.

**Side Effects:**

Like all antibiotics, cefetamet pivoxil can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash

More serious, but less common, side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis â€“ seek immediate medical attention if this occurs)
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (a serious intestinal infection)
* Liver problems (jaundice, elevated liver enzymes)
* Seizures (particularly in patients with pre-existing seizure disorders or kidney problems)
* Blood disorders (e.g., neutropenia)

This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult a doctor or pharmacist for complete information and to report any concerning side effects.

**How it Works:**

Cefetamet pivoxil is a prodrug; this means it's inactive until it's metabolized in the body into its active form, cefetamet.  Cefetamet works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  This disruption prevents the bacteria from properly building and maintaining their cell walls, leading to their death.  It's primarily bactericidal (kills bacteria), though it can have bacteriostatic effects (inhibits bacterial growth) at lower concentrations.

**FAQs:**

* **Is cefetamet pivoxil available over-the-counter?** No, it requires a prescription from a doctor.
* **Can I take cefetamet pivoxil with alcohol?**  It's generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking antibiotics, as it can interact negatively and worsen side effects.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific advice.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **How long should I take cefetamet pivoxil?**  The duration of treatment depends on the type and severity of the infection.  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Do not stop taking the medication early, even if you feel better.
* **What should I do if I experience a severe allergic reaction?** Seek immediate medical attention.  Allergic reactions to cephalosporins can be life-threatening.
