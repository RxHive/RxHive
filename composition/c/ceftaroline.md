# Ceftaroline
### Generic Name
Ceftaroline

### Usage
Ceftaroline is a powerful antibiotic belonging to the cephalosporin family.  Its primary use is in treating two specific bacterial infections:

* **Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP):** This is a lung infection contracted outside of a hospital setting. Ceftaroline is particularly effective against certain types of bacteria that cause this pneumonia, including those resistant to other antibiotics like methicillin.

* **Acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSI):** This encompasses various bacterial infections affecting the skin and underlying tissues, such as cellulitis, abscesses, and wound infections.  Again, Ceftaroline's effectiveness against methicillin-resistant bacteria makes it a valuable treatment option for these infections.


While not its primary indication, Ceftaroline is sometimes used off-label for treating pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis in children and adolescents and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.  Always follow your doctor's instructions and do not self-medicate with Ceftaroline.


### Dosage

**Dosage information is complex and varies greatly based on the condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, and kidney function.  The information below is for general understanding only and should not be considered a substitute for guidance from a healthcare professional.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist for precise dosing instructions.**

**Adults (IV administration):**

* **Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP):** Typically 600 mg every 12 hours, infused over 5-60 minutes for 5-7 days.
* **Acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSI):** Typically 600 mg every 12 hours, infused over 5-60 minutes for 5-14 days.

**Children (IV administration):**  Dosage for children is weight-based and varies widely depending on age and the specific infection being treated.  Doses range from 6 mg/kg every 8 hours to 15 mg/kg every 8 hours (with a maximum of 600 mg per dose), and the duration of treatment varies (5-14 days).  Precise instructions must be obtained from a pediatrician or infectious disease specialist.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are sometimes necessary for patients with impaired kidney function.  Reduced doses are recommended based on creatinine clearance (CrCl) levels.  Individuals undergoing hemodialysis require special dosing considerations.

### Side Effects

The following is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Skin rash
* Pruritus (itching)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Seizures
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
*  Clostridioides difficile colitis (a serious bowel infection)
*  Blood abnormalities (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Liver enzyme elevations
* Kidney problems


**If you experience any of these side effects, particularly severe or persistent ones, seek immediate medical attention.**

### How it Works

Ceftaroline is a beta-lactam antibiotic. It works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to build their cell walls. It does this by binding to specific proteins (penicillin-binding proteins) within the bacterial cell. This disruption leads to bacterial cell death.  Ceftaroline is particularly effective against bacteria that are resistant to many other antibiotics, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Ceftaroline should be avoided if you have a known severe allergy to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactam antibiotics.  A history of penicillin allergy does increase the risk of allergic reactions.
* **Kidney Function:**  Individuals with impaired kidney function require careful dose adjustments to avoid building up harmful levels of the drug.
* **Liver Function:** Ceftaroline can affect liver enzymes; liver function should be monitored during treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of Ceftaroline during pregnancy and breastfeeding isn't fully established.  Consult your doctor before using it if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Ceftaroline can interact with other medications, including certain vaccines and anticoagulants (blood thinners).  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.
* **Superinfections:** Long-term use of Ceftaroline can increase the risk of developing other infections, such as fungal or bacterial superinfections.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Ceftaroline?**  A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.  Generally, Ceftaroline should be stored at a controlled room temperature.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Ceftaroline?** A:  Alcohol can sometimes interact negatively with antibiotics. Check with your doctor or pharmacist regarding alcohol consumption while on this medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for advice. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q: Is Ceftaroline safe for children?** A:  Ceftaroline can be used in children under strict medical supervision and with careful dose adjustments based on weight and age. A pediatrician or infectious disease specialist should determine the appropriate dose and duration of treatment.
* **Q: How long does it take for Ceftaroline to work?** A:  The timeframe for improvement will depend on factors like the severity of the infection. You should start to feel better within a few days, but the complete course of treatment must be followed.
