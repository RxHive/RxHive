# Carbenoxolone
### Generic Name
Carbenoxolone

### Usage
Carbenoxolone is primarily used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and mouth ulceration.  In GERD, it helps protect the lining of the esophagus and stomach from the damaging effects of stomach acid. For mouth ulcers, it's applied topically to promote healing.  While primarily used for these conditions, its application may extend to other areas, but this should always be under the strict guidance of a physician.

### Dosage

**Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD):**

* **Adults:** The usual dose is 20mg three times a day (TID) orally.  This should be taken before meals.

**Mouth ulceration:**

* **Adults:**  A 2% gel is applied directly to the affected area four times a day (QID).


**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of carbenoxolone have not been established in children under 3 years old.  It's contraindicated in this age group.  Dosage for children older than 3 years is not established and should only be determined by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with these conditions.  A doctor should carefully assess the need and dosage based on the individual's health status.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are not clearly defined in available literature.  However, potential side effects can include:

* Sodium and water retention
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects can also occur.  It's crucial to seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning symptoms.

### How it Works

Carbenoxolone is a derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid.  It works by strengthening the protective mucosal barrier in the gastrointestinal tract. This barrier protects the lining of the esophagus and stomach from the damaging effects of stomach acid and pepsin.  It also enhances the production of mucin, a lubricating substance that further protects the mucosal lining.  In mouth ulcers, this protective and healing action helps facilitate faster recovery.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to carbenoxolone or any component of its formulation.
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels).
* Cardiac failure (heart failure).
* Patients currently receiving cardiac glycosides (heart medications).
* Children under 3 years of age.
* Pregnancy (carbenoxolone is contraindicated during pregnancy).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Use with caution in patients with cardiac diseases like hypertension (high blood pressure).
* Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.
*  Alcohol should be avoided while taking carbenoxolone.  
* Adequate hydration is important.

**Drug Interactions:**

* Carbenoxolone can antagonize (counteract) the effects of amiloride and spironolactone (potassium-sparing diuretics).  Concurrent use should be avoided.
* It can worsen hypokalemia caused by diuretics.  Concurrent use should be avoided.
*  The risk of toxicity increases when used with digitalis glycosides. Concurrent use should be avoided.
