# Cefalexin

**Generic Name:** Cefalexin

**Usage:** Cefalexin is an antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Skin infections:** such as impetigo, cellulitis, and abscesses.
* **Ear infections:** such as otitis media (middle ear infection).
* **Respiratory tract infections:** such as bronchitis and pneumonia (although it's less commonly used for these now due to resistance).
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** such as cystitis and pyelonephritis.
* **Bone and joint infections:** although often used in combination with other antibiotics.


**Note:** Cefalexin is only effective against bacteria; it will not treat viral infections like the common cold or flu.  Always consult a doctor to determine the appropriate antibiotic for your infection.  Improper use can lead to antibiotic resistance.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, cefalexin can cause side effects.  These can range from mild to severe. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  These are often mild and may resolve on their own.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives. In rare cases, more severe allergic reactions like anaphylaxis can occur (this is a medical emergency requiring immediate attention).
* **Vaginal yeast infection:**  Cefalexin can disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in the vagina, leading to a yeast infection.
* **Changes in blood counts:** Although rare, cefalexin can affect blood cell counts.
* **Kidney problems:**  In rare cases, cefalexin can damage the kidneys, especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney disease.


**How it Works:** Cefalexin is a beta-lactam antibiotic. It works by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  By disrupting cell wall formation, cefalexin prevents bacteria from growing and reproducing, ultimately leading to their death.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking cefalexin?**  While there's no direct interaction, alcohol can worsen some of cefalexin's side effects, particularly gastrointestinal issues. It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.
* **Can I take cefalexin if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Consult your doctor.  While generally considered safe in moderate doses during pregnancy and breastfeeding, the benefits must be weighed against potential risks.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.
* **What should I do if I experience a severe allergic reaction?**  Seek immediate medical attention.  Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, and hives.
* **How long should I take cefalexin?**  The duration of treatment depends on the type and severity of the infection.  Always follow your doctor's instructions and complete the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better.  Stopping early can lead to recurrence of the infection and antibiotic resistance.
* **Can I take cefalexin with other medications?**  Inform your doctor about all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking, as interactions are possible.
