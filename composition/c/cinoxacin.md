# Cinoxacin
### Generic Name
Cinoxacin

### Usage
Cinoxacin is primarily used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs).  It's a synthetic antibacterial agent effective against various bacteria commonly causing UTIs. While its primary application is treating active UTIs, it also finds use in preventing UTIs (prophylaxis), particularly in individuals with a recurrent history of infections.  The decision to use cinoxacin for prophylaxis versus treatment should always be made in consultation with a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Treatment of UTIs:** The typical dose is 500 mg twice daily (BID) for 7 to 14 days.  The duration of treatment depends on the severity of the infection and the individual's response to therapy.
* **Prophylaxis of UTIs:** A single 500 mg dose at bedtime can be used for up to 5 months.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of cinoxacin in children under 18 years of age have not been established.  Therefore, it is not recommended for use in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (reduced creatinine clearance).  The specific adjustments depend on the creatinine clearance rate (CrCl) and should be determined by a healthcare professional.  Generally, lower doses and less frequent administration are required.  Cinoxacin should be avoided in patients with anuria (absence of urine production).
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's label doesn't specify dosage adjustments for patients with liver impairment. However, caution is advised, and close monitoring is essential.

**Administration:** Cinoxacin is usually administered orally as tablets.  It can be taken with or without food, but consistency in administration (always with or always without food) is recommended.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Skin reactions (pruritus, rash, edema),  tingling sensations, insomnia, drowsiness, toxic psychosis, convulsions, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, ALP), tendon rupture, hypersensitivity reactions.

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Cinoxacin is a quinolone antibiotic. It works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase, an enzyme essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. By blocking this enzyme, cinoxacin prevents bacterial cells from multiplying and ultimately leads to their death. This mechanism targets the bacteria causing the UTI, allowing the body's immune system to clear the infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cinoxacin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to cinoxacin or any component of the formulation and those with convulsive disorders.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Cinoxacin may interact with several other medications.  Concomitant use with probenecid, ciclosporin, oral anticoagulants, NSAIDs, xanthines, and nitrofurantoin should be avoided or carefully managed under medical supervision. Acetovanillone may enhance cinoxacin's neuroexcitatory effects.
* **Warnings:**  Use caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, CNS disorders, porphyria, G6PD deficiency, or those at risk for phototoxicity (increased sensitivity to sunlight).  It's categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Phototoxicity:**  Cinoxacin can increase sensitivity to sunlight.  Patients should minimize sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take cinoxacin with food?** A:  You can take cinoxacin with or without food, but maintain consistency in your approach (always with or always without).

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store cinoxacin?** A:  Store cinoxacin as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I take cinoxacin if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  Consult your doctor before taking cinoxacin if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.  It is categorized as pregnancy category C, and its excretion in breast milk is unknown.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.
