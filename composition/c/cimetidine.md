# Cimetidine
### Generic Name
Cimetidine

### Usage
Cimetidine is primarily an H2 receptor antagonist used to reduce stomach acid production.  Its main uses are in treating and preventing stomach and duodenal ulcers, and managing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also known as heartburn or acid reflux.  It's also sometimes used off-label for conditions like interstitial cystitis (bladder pain syndrome) and stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients, though these uses require careful consideration and monitoring by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and the route of administration (oral or intravenous).  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  The following are examples and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **GERD:**  Oral: 800 mg twice daily or 400 mg four times daily for up to 12 weeks.  
* **Ulcers (duodenal or gastric):** Oral: 800 mg at bedtime, 400 mg every 12 hours, or 300 mg every 6 hours.
* **Upper GI Bleeding/Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome:** Intravenous: Continuous infusion up to 75 mg/hour, or intermittent doses of 200 mg every 4-6 hours (maximum 2g/day).
* **Heartburn (prevention/symptomatic treatment):** Oral: 200 mg twice daily (maximum 400 mg/day).  May be taken 30 minutes before meals or drinks that trigger heartburn.
* **Interstitial Cystitis (off-label):** Oral: 200 mg three times daily, or 300-400 mg twice daily.
* **Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis (off-label):** Oral/Nasogastric tube: 300 mg four times daily.  Use is generally limited to patients with significant risk factors (e.g., coagulopathy, prolonged mechanical ventilation, sepsis) and should be discontinued once those risks resolve.


**Children:** Dosage in children is generally limited to adolescents (12 years and older) and  is highly condition-specific,  requiring careful determination by a physician based on the individual's weight and health status.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  Individuals with severe kidney impairment often require reduced dosages and altered dosing schedules.  Geriatric patients may also require dosage adjustments due to an increased risk of side effects.  Always consult with a doctor for appropriate adjustments.


### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Diarrhea
* Gynecomastia (breast enlargement in men)

**Less Common but Serious:**

* Confusion
* Agitation
* Hallucinations
* Liver problems (increased liver enzymes)
* Kidney problems (increased creatinine levels)
* Blood disorders (agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia)
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)

Note:  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Cimetidine works by blocking histamine H2 receptors in the stomach lining.  Histamine stimulates the production of stomach acid. By blocking these receptors, cimetidine reduces the amount of acid produced, helping to heal ulcers and alleviate symptoms of GERD and other acid-related conditions.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cimetidine should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to cimetidine.
* **Interactions:** Cimetidine can interact with numerous other medications, affecting their absorption or effectiveness.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Particular attention should be paid to potential interactions with anticoagulants, theophylline, phenytoin, ketoconazole, and other drugs metabolized by the liver.
* **Specific Populations:** Caution is advised in patients with liver or kidney disease, immunocompromised individuals, the elderly, and children.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration of the benefits versus risks.
* **Other Precautions:** Patients should report any signs of confusion, changes in mental status, or unusual bleeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take cimetidine with antacids?** A:  It's best to avoid taking cimetidine with antacids simultaneously, as antacids can interfere with its absorption.  Consult your doctor for proper spacing of these medications.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The time to notice symptom relief varies depending on the condition and individual response.  It can take several days to several weeks for full therapeutic effect.
* **Q: How should I store cimetidine?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Can I stop taking cimetidine abruptly?** A:  It is generally recommended to taper off cimetidine under the guidance of a doctor, rather than stopping suddenly.  Abrupt cessation can potentially lead to a rebound increase in stomach acid production.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double up on doses.
