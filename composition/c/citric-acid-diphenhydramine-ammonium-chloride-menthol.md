# Citric Acid + Diphenhydramine + Ammonium Chloride + Menthol

It's crucial to understand that combining Citric Acid, Diphenhydramine, Ammonium Chloride, and Menthol in a single formulation is **not a standard or approved pharmaceutical combination**.  There is no generic drug product that uses this specific quartet of ingredients in a pre-mixed form.  While each ingredient has its own uses, their combined effect is unpredictable and potentially unsafe without proper pharmaceutical formulation and testing.  Therefore, the following information is based on the individual components and their known effects, *not* a hypothetical combination.  **Do not attempt to create or use such a combination without explicit guidance from a qualified healthcare professional.**

* **Diphenhydramine:** An antihistamine used to treat allergies, cold symptoms, and insomnia.
* **Ammonium Chloride:** Used as an expectorant (helps loosen phlegm) and in some diuretics.  It can also be found in some electrolyte solutions.
