# Calcium Carbonate + Vitamin D + Methylcobalamin + L-Methyl Folate Calcium + Pyridoxal-

**Generic Name:** Calcium Carbonate + Vitamin D + Methylcobalamin + L-Methylfolate Calcium + Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (Note:  The generic name is incomplete;  "Pyridoxal-" needs to be completed.  Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate is assumed here as it's a common active form of Vitamin B6.)

**Usage:** This combination supplement addresses several nutritional deficiencies simultaneously.  Its primary use is to prevent and treat deficiencies in calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin), folate (L-methylfolate calcium), and vitamin B6 (pyridoxal-5'-phosphate). These deficiencies can contribute to various health problems.

* **Calcium & Vitamin D:**  Essential for strong bones and teeth, preventing osteoporosis and osteomalacia.  Vitamin D aids in calcium absorption.  Deficiencies can lead to bone pain, weakness, and increased fracture risk.

* **Vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin):** Crucial for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. Deficiency (pernicious anemia) can cause fatigue, weakness, numbness, tingling, and neurological problems. Methylcobalamin is a readily usable form of B12.

* **Folate (L-Methylfolate Calcium):**  A key nutrient for cell growth and division, especially important during pregnancy.  Deficiency can lead to anemia, birth defects (neural tube defects), and other health issues. L-methylfolate is a superior form of folate for many individuals.

* **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate):** Involved in numerous metabolic processes, including red blood cell formation, brain development, and immune function. Deficiency is less common but can cause anemia, skin problems, and neurological symptoms.

Secondary uses might include supporting overall health and well-being in individuals with increased nutritional needs (e.g., pregnant women, older adults, strict vegetarians).  However, it's crucial to remember this is a *supplement* and not a treatment for underlying medical conditions.


**Dosage:** Dosage varies significantly depending on individual needs, age, health status, and the specific formulation.  **Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or the product label.**  There is no single universal dosage.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dose based on a thorough assessment.  The supplement may come in tablet, capsule, or syrup form.

**Side Effects:**

* **Common:**  Mild gastrointestinal upset (nausea, constipation, diarrhea), headache, flushing.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), kidney stones (with high calcium intake).
* **Note:**  While rare, high doses of certain vitamins can have adverse effects.  Consult a doctor immediately if you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects.


**How it Works:** This supplement works by directly replenishing essential nutrients.  Calcium and Vitamin D strengthen bones.  Methylcobalamin and L-methylfolate support nerve function and red blood cell production. Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate plays a role in numerous metabolic processes.  The combined action of these nutrients contributes to overall health and well-being by addressing potential deficiencies.
