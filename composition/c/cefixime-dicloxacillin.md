# Cefixime + Dicloxacillin
### Generic Name
Cefixime + Dicloxacillin (Combination)

**Note:**  Cefixime and Dicloxacillin are typically prescribed as individual medications, not a pre-mixed combination.  A doctor might prescribe them together to address specific infections, tailoring the dosage and duration to the patient's needs. This information discusses the individual components and their combined potential use, but it is crucial to follow your doctor's specific instructions for any prescribed medication.


### Usage

This combination is not a standard pre-mixed formulation. However, doctors may prescribe Cefixime and Dicloxacillin together to treat bacterial infections, particularly those suspected to involve both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

* **Cefixime:** A third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, effective against a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria causing infections like bronchitis, pneumonia, ear infections (otitis media), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and gonorrhea.

* **Dicloxacillin:** A penicillinase-resistant penicillin antibiotic, effective against various Gram-positive bacteria causing skin infections, respiratory infections, and bone infections.


The combined use is intended to broaden the antibiotic coverage, targeting infections potentially caused by a mix of bacterial types.  The decision to use this combination must be made by a doctor based on the specific infection, bacterial sensitivity testing (if available), and the patient's overall health.


### Dosage

**Dosage is entirely dependent on the prescribing physician and should never be self-determined.**  The doctor considers factors such as the infection's severity, the patient's age, weight, kidney function, and any other health conditions. There is no standard "combined" dosage, as each medication is usually prescribed separately.

* **Cefixime:** Dosage varies significantly depending on the infection being treated and the patient's characteristics.  Oral forms are common, with doses ranging from 200mg to 400mg once or twice daily. Intravenous administration is possible but requires hospitalization.

* **Dicloxacillin:** Dosage also depends on the infection and patient factors.  Oral forms are standard, usually 250mg to 500mg four times a day. Intravenous administration is available but less common.


**Children's Dosage:**  Pediatric dosages for both Cefixime and Dicloxacillin are carefully calculated based on weight and the specific infection.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage.


### Side Effects

**Cefixime:**

* Common: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
* Less Common but Serious:  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), pseudomembranous colitis (severe intestinal inflammation).


**Dicloxacillin:**

* Common: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps.
* Less Common but Serious: Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling),  hepatitis (liver inflammation).


**Combined Side Effects:**  When taken together, the possibility of experiencing side effects from either drug increases.  Always report any adverse reactions to your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

* **Cefixime:** Interferes with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.  This is effective against Gram-negative bacteria.

* **Dicloxacillin:**  Also inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, but it's resistant to breakdown by enzymes (penicillinases) produced by some bacteria, making it effective against penicillinase-producing Gram-positive bacteria.


The combination provides a broader spectrum of antibacterial activity by targeting both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria through a shared mechanism.



### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Individuals with known allergies to cephalosporins (Cefixime) or penicillins (Dicloxacillin) should not take these medications.  A history of allergic reactions to one might increase the risk of reacting to the other.

* **Kidney Problems:**  Both drugs are processed by the kidneys.  Dosage adjustments might be necessary for people with kidney impairment.

* **Liver Problems:**  Dicloxacillin can potentially affect liver function.  Individuals with liver disease should be closely monitored.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult a doctor before taking these medications during pregnancy or breastfeeding, as both drugs may pass into breast milk and could potentially affect the developing fetus or infant.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Cefixime and Dicloxacillin can interact with certain medications. Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Alcohol Consumption:** Combining these antibiotics with alcohol is generally not advised, as it can potentially increase side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking these medications if I feel better?**  A: No.  Complete the entire course of antibiotics prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better, to prevent recurrence of the infection and development of antibiotic resistance.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention.

* **Q: How should I store these medications?** A: Store them as directed on the prescription label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Are these medications safe for children?** A:  They can be, but only under a doctor's supervision and with properly calculated dosages.

* **Q: Can I take these medications with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor about all other medications you take to prevent harmful interactions.  Never start or stop medications without your doctor's advice.
