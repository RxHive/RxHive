# Cefixime + Dicloxacillin

It's crucial to understand that **Cefixime and Dicloxacillin are not typically combined in a single medication**.  They are two separate antibiotics with different mechanisms of action and are prescribed individually based on the specific infection. Combining them without a doctor's prescription is dangerous and could lead to adverse interactions or ineffective treatment.

Therefore, providing information on a "generic Cefixime + Dicloxacillin" is inaccurate and potentially harmful.  Information will be provided separately for each antibiotic.

**Cefixime:**

**Generic Name:** Cefixime

**Usage:** Cefixime is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the ears, nose, throat, lungs (pneumonia), urinary tract, and skin.  It's effective against a range of gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria.  Specific usage is determined by a doctor based on the infection.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and headache.  More serious, though rare, side effects can include allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), seizures, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.

**How it Works:** Cefixime works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to build their cell walls, ultimately leading to their death.


**Dicloxacillin:**

**Generic Name:** Dicloxacillin

**Usage:** Dicloxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin antibiotic used to treat infections caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcal infections of the skin, bones, and lungs.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and rash.  More serious side effects, though rare, can include allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), jaundice, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.


**How it Works:** Dicloxacillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial death.
