# Cetrimide + Gamma Benzene Hexachloride
### Generic Name
Cetrimide + Gamma Benzene Hexachloride (Note: Gamma Benzene Hexachloride is also known as Lindane)

### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used topically to treat various skin infestations caused by parasites, specifically lice (pediculosis) and scabies (scabies infestation).  Cetrimide, a quaternary ammonium compound, possesses antiseptic and detergent properties, aiding in the removal of parasites and their eggs. Gamma Benzene Hexachloride (Lindane), an organochlorine insecticide, is the active ingredient that directly kills the parasites.  While effective against lice and scabies, it's crucial to understand that this combination is not used for other skin conditions or infections.  The use should be strictly directed by a medical professional.

### Dosage
Dosage instructions vary greatly depending on the specific product formulation, the age of the patient, and the severity of the infestation.  Therefore, it is absolutely crucial to follow the instructions printed on the product packaging and/or given by a healthcare professional.  There is no standardized dosage that can be provided here.  Generally, for topical application, the medication is applied to the affected areas, following the precise instructions for the productâ€™s application method (e.g., washing, leaving on for a specific duration, and rinsing).  Oral or intravenous (IV) administration of this combination is not recommended and is not a standard practice.  Children require particularly careful dosage monitoring and adult supervision to prevent accidental ingestion.

### Side Effects
* **Common:** Skin irritation (itching, redness, burning sensation), dryness, rash.  These are often mild and temporary.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Neurological symptoms such as seizures (especially in children, individuals with a history of seizures, or those with impaired liver or kidney function), headache, dizziness, tremors.  Allergic reactions (skin rashes, swelling, difficulty breathing).  These require immediate medical attention.
* **Note:** Lindane is absorbed through the skin, and systemic absorption, even with topical application, can lead to adverse effects.


### How it Works
Cetrimide works by disrupting the cell membranes of the parasites, leading to their death.  It also acts as a detergent, aiding in the removal of parasites and their eggs from the skin.  Gamma Benzene Hexachloride (Lindane) acts as a neurotoxin in parasites.  It interferes with their nerve impulse transmission, eventually leading to paralysis and death.  The combined action of both ingredients enhances the effectiveness of parasite removal and elimination.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This combination should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to any of its components (Cetrimide or Lindane).  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should generally avoid using Lindane due to its potential for harm to the developing fetus or infant.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Interactions with other medications are possible, though not extensively documented for this specific combination.  It's vital to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes (nose, mouth), and broken skin.  Do not use on large areas of the body.  Wash hands thoroughly after application.  Do not reuse the medication.  Keep out of reach of children.  Seek immediate medical attention if any serious side effects occur.  Lindane should be used with extreme caution in children and infants, due to a higher risk of neurotoxicity.
