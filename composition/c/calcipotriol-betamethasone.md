# Calcipotriol + Betamethasone
### Generic Name
Calcipotriol + Betamethasone

### Usage

Calcipotriol and Betamethasone combination is a topical treatment primarily used for plaque psoriasis in patients 12 years and older.  Plaque psoriasis is a chronic skin condition characterized by raised, red, scaly patches. This combination therapy works by combining the actions of two different active ingredients to effectively manage the symptoms.  Calcipotriol, a vitamin D analogue, helps regulate skin cell growth, reducing the rapid production of skin cells that causes psoriatic plaques. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation and itching associated with the condition.  It is important to note that this medication treats the symptoms of psoriasis, not the underlying cause.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the formulation (cream, ointment, foam, gel, suspension) and the area of the body being treated.  Always follow your doctor's prescription and the instructions provided with your medication.   The following are *general guidelines* and should not replace professional medical advice:


* **Adults:** Dosage varies based on the formulation and typically involves applying a thin layer once daily to the affected area(s).  Maximum weekly doses are usually specified for each formulation (e.g., 100g/week for certain creams and ointments;  60g every 4 days for some foams). Treatment should continue until the psoriasis is controlled, and then the medication should be discontinued.

* **Children (â‰¥12 years):** The safety and efficacy of this combination haven't been fully established in children under 12. For those 12 and older, the dosage is generally similar to that of adults, but maximum weekly doses may be lower for younger adolescents, as determined by a physician. Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

* **Dosage Forms:** The medication comes in various forms, including cream, ointment, foam, gel, and suspension. Each form has its own specific application instructions and maximum dosages.


**Crucial Note:**  Never exceed the recommended dosage.  Applying more medication will not make it work faster and can increase the risk of side effects.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients in some studies) can include:

* HPA-axis suppression (affecting hormone production)
* Burning sensation or irritation at the application site
* Itching, redness, or other skin reactions

Less common but serious side effects can include:

* Headache
* Exfoliative dermatitis (severe skin peeling)
* Acne-like rash
* Allergic reactions
* Increased calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia)

If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Calcipotriol and Betamethasone work synergistically to treat psoriasis. Calcipotriol, a vitamin D analogue, slows down the overproduction of skin cells characteristic of psoriasis. This is achieved by binding to vitamin D receptors in skin cells, thus regulating their growth and differentiation.  Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the release of inflammatory chemicals in the skin. The combination of these two actions leads to a reduction in the size, redness, and scaling of psoriatic plaques.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used if you are allergic to calcipotriol, betamethasone, or any other ingredients. It's also contraindicated in several skin infections (fungal, bacterial, viral), certain skin conditions (e.g., acne, rosacea, perioral dermatitis), and in cases of severe liver or kidney disease (for certain formulations).  See the product information for complete details.


* **Interactions:**  This medication may interact with other drugs, particularly those affecting calcium metabolism (e.g., thiazide diuretics) or those with potential interactions with vitamin D analogues and corticosteroids. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.


* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy should be carefully considered, with low-potency alternatives preferred when possible.  The decision to breastfeed while using this medication should be made in consultation with your doctor, considering the potential risk to the infant.  Avoid applying the medication directly to the breasts if breastfeeding.


* **Children:**  Use in children under 12 years old is not recommended due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.

* **Large Surface Areas:**  Applying the medication to large areas of the body should be done with caution under strict medical supervision.


* **Sun Exposure:** Minimize exposure of treated skin to sunlight or UV radiation to avoid potential photosensitivity.
