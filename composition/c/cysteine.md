# Cysteine
### Generic Name
Cysteine

### Usage

Cysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid primarily used to meet the nutritional needs of individuals unable to produce sufficient quantities on their own.  Its main application is in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for:

* **Newborn infants:**  Especially those requiring TPN due to various medical reasons.  Cysteine is a crucial component for their growth and development.
* **Adults and children with severe liver disease:**  Liver disease can impair the body's ability to process amino acids, including cysteine synthesis.  Supplementing with cysteine helps provide essential building blocks for protein production.

Secondary uses include adding cysteine to amino acid solutions to create a more complete amino acid profile for improved protein synthesis in patients undergoing TPN.


### Dosage

Cysteine dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors including the patient's age, weight, overall health, and the specific nutritional requirements.  It's *always* administered as part of a complete parenteral nutrition solution, never given alone.  Dosages are usually expressed in milligrams of cysteine hydrochloride per gram of amino acids in the TPN solution.

**Adults:**

* **Stable patients (maintenance):**  Typically 7 mg cysteine hydrochloride/gram of amino acids (equivalent to 5 mg cysteine/gram amino acids).
* **Critically ill patients (severe stress):**  May require a higher dose, often 7 mg cysteine hydrochloride/gram of amino acids (equivalent to 5 mg cysteine/gram amino acids), but the total amount of amino acids given will be higher.

**Pediatrics:**

Dosage is complex and varies significantly by age and health status.  Consult specific guidelines for the appropriate dose, as recommended by ASPEN (American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition).  Generally:

* **Infants:**  Dosages range from 20-40 mg cysteine hydrochloride/gram of amino acids, depending on the severity of the condition and availability of cysteine.
* **Infants and children (≤11 years):**  A lower dose (e.g., 22 mg cysteine hydrochloride/gram of amino acids) is often recommended, along with appropriate adjustment of the total protein intake.
* **Children (≥12 years and adolescents):**  Dosage recommendations approach those of adults.


**Administration:** Cysteine is always administered intravenously (IV) as part of a carefully prepared TPN solution.  The solution should be administered through a central venous catheter if its osmolality exceeds 900 mOsm/L.  Healthcare professionals determine the appropriate concentration and infusion rate.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Localized warmth
* Flushing
* Localized erythema (redness)
* Nausea

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur, particularly with high doses or in individuals with underlying conditions. These include:

* Hyperammonemia (high blood ammonia levels)
* Metabolic acidosis (increased acidity in the blood)
* Infusion-site reactions (pain, swelling, redness at the injection site)
* Injection-site phlebitis (inflammation of the vein)
* Venous thrombosis (blood clot in a vein)
* Fever

**Important:** Any adverse effects, regardless of severity, should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Cysteine is a conditionally essential amino acid, meaning the body can usually produce it, but needs to be supplied externally in certain situations. Cysteine is a crucial component of many proteins and plays important roles in cellular processes.  It is a precursor to glutathione, a potent antioxidant, and taurine, an important compound for several functions. In patients unable to synthesize sufficient cysteine, providing it through TPN helps support protein synthesis, improves antioxidant defenses, and contributes to overall health.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cysteine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity, inborn errors of amino acid metabolism, pulmonary edema or acidosis from low cardiac output, hepatic coma, and certain metabolic disorders.
* **Interactions:** Although not extensively studied for direct drug interactions, it is important to inform the healthcare provider of all medications being taken, especially those that may affect kidney or liver function.
* **Special Populations:**  Careful monitoring is necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, as cysteine metabolism and excretion may be affected.  Use caution in patients with pulmonary disease, acid-base imbalances, or electrolyte abnormalities.  Adjustments may be needed during pregnancy and lactation due to increased amino acid requirements, but this should be guided by a healthcare provider.
* **Aluminum Toxicity:** Some formulations contain aluminum; this should be taken into consideration in patients with renal impairment.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take cysteine on its own as a supplement?**  A: No. Cysteine for medical use is administered only as part of a carefully formulated parenteral nutrition solution by a healthcare professional.  Do not attempt self-medication.

* **Q: How is cysteine stored?** A: Storage requirements will vary depending on the specific formulation.  Always follow the storage instructions provided by the manufacturer.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of cysteine therapy?** A: Long-term effects depend on the underlying condition and the duration of TPN.  Regular monitoring is necessary to assess its efficacy and manage potential adverse effects.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects to your healthcare provider immediately.  They can assess the severity of the reaction and take appropriate measures.
