# Cetirizine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Generic Name:** Cetirizine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or other upper respiratory allergies.  Cetirizine is an antihistamine that relieves runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes. Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant (antitussive) that reduces coughing.  It's important to note that this combination is typically used for *coughs with allergic symptoms*, not for coughs caused by other conditions (e.g., bronchitis, whooping cough).  Always consult a doctor before using this medication, especially if your cough is persistent or severe, or if it's accompanied by a fever, rash, or difficulty breathing.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, nausea, and fatigue.  More serious, though less common, side effects are possible.  These can include allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), fast heartbeat, hallucinations, seizures, and liver problems.  Stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.

**How it Works:** Cetirizine blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking histamine, it helps reduce allergic symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes. Dextromethorphan works in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.  It doesn't treat the underlying cause of the cough but helps to reduce the frequency and intensity of coughing fits.
