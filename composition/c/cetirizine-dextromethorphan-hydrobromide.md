# Cetirizine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide
### Generic Name
Cetirizine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide


### Usage

This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold or upper respiratory allergies.  It combines two active ingredients: cetirizine and dextromethorphan hydrobromide.

* **Cetirizine:** This is an antihistamine that works to reduce allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes, and hives.  It blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This is a cough suppressant (antitussive). It works in the brain to reduce the urge to cough.  It's effective for a dry, non-productive cough, meaning a cough that doesn't produce mucus.  It's generally not recommended for coughs that produce phlegm (productive coughs).


This combination medicine is primarily used for symptomatic relief of cold and allergy symptoms *together*.  It's important to understand that it doesn't treat the underlying cause of the illness (like a viral infection) but rather helps manage the unpleasant symptoms.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific brand and formulation of the medication. Always follow the instructions provided on the product label or by your healthcare provider.  **Never exceed the recommended dosage.**

**Generally, for adults and children (age restrictions vary greatly by product, check individual product labeling):**

* **Oral:** The medication usually comes in tablet or syrup form.  Dosage will be clearly stated on the product's packaging and should be followed carefully.  Generally, it's taken once or twice a day, depending on the formulation and your doctor's recommendation.
* **IV:**  This combination medication is not typically administered intravenously (IV).  Cetirizine and dextromethorphan are usually given orally.

**Important Considerations:**  Dosage may need adjustment for individuals with kidney or liver problems.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medication if you have any pre-existing health conditions.  Children's dosages are significantly lower than adult dosages and are usually determined based on age and weight.  Always check the product labeling for precise instructions regarding pediatric use.



### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Fatigue

Less common, but potentially more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Fast heartbeat
* Hallucinations (especially with high doses of dextromethorphan)
* Seizures


If you experience any serious side effects, stop taking the medication immediately and seek medical attention.


### How it Works

Cetirizine blocks histamine receptors, preventing histamine from binding and causing allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itching. Dextromethorphan works in the brain to suppress the cough reflex by affecting the cough center.  The combination provides relief from both allergic and cough symptoms associated with colds and upper respiratory allergies.
