# Camylofin + Mefenamic Acid
### Generic Name
Camylofin + Mefenamic Acid

### Usage

Camylofin + Mefenamic Acid is a combination medication used primarily to relieve moderate to severe pain, particularly pain associated with menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea).  Camylofin, a muscle relaxant, helps to alleviate pain by reducing muscle spasms, while mefenamic acid, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), works by reducing inflammation and pain signals.  While its primary use is for menstrual pain, it might be used off-label by a doctor for other types of pain, but this should always be under strict medical supervision.  It's crucial to understand that this combination is not a first-line treatment for all types of pain and should only be used as prescribed by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

Dosage will vary depending on the individual's age, weight, and the severity of their pain.  **It is critical to follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist exactly.**  There is no standardized universally applicable dosage.  The medication is typically administered orally.  Information about IV administration is not readily available for this specific combination; IV administration would likely be done with the individual components separately and under close medical supervision if ever necessary.

* **Adults:**  The exact dosage of Camylofin and Mefenamic Acid will be specified by your doctor.  Do not exceed the recommended dosage.
* **Children:** This medication is generally not recommended for use in children.  Its use in children requires careful evaluation by a pediatrician and should only be considered in exceptional circumstances and under strict medical supervision.

### How it Works

Camylofin and Mefenamic Acid work synergistically to reduce pain. Camylofin acts as a muscle relaxant, easing muscle spasms that can contribute to pain, particularly in the case of menstrual cramps.  Mefenamic acid, an NSAID, works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause inflammation and pain. By reducing inflammation and relaxing muscles, the combination medication provides effective pain relief.
