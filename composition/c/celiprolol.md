# Celiprolol
### Generic Name
Celiprolol

### Usage

Celiprolol is primarily used to treat two cardiovascular conditions: hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart).  It works by blocking specific receptors in the heart and blood vessels, leading to a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure, and improved blood flow to the heart. While its primary use is for these two conditions, Celiprolol may also be considered in the management of Marfan syndrome in pregnant women.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Hypertension:** The usual dose is 200-400 mg once daily (OD) orally.
* **Angina Pectoris:** Treatment typically begins with 200 mg OD orally.  The dose may be increased to 400 mg OD after 2-4 weeks if needed and determined appropriate by a physician.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of celiprolol in children have not been established. It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for liver impairment.  Lower doses and careful monitoring are advised.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on creatinine clearance (CrCl).  For CrCl >40 mL/min, no adjustment is needed. For CrCl 40-15 mL/min, administer 50% of the usual dose. Celiprolol is not recommended for individuals with CrCl <15 mL/min.

**Administration:** Celiprolol is administered orally. It's recommended to take it in the morning, 30 minutes before or 2 hours after a meal, with a full glass of water.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, headache, insomnia, nightmares
* Cardiovascular: Bradycardia (slow heart rate), cold extremities, orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing), palpitations
* Dermatologic: Erythema (redness), hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), pruritus (itching), skin rash
* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal distress, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting
* Neuromuscular & Skeletal: Muscle cramps, tremor


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Atrioventricular block
* Cardiac arrhythmia
* Syncope (fainting)
* Exacerbation of psoriasis
* Worsening of diabetes
* Allergic reactions (skin reactions, hypersensitivity pneumonitis)
* Bronchospasm (wheezing)


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Celiprolol is a selective beta-1 adrenoceptor blocker. This means it primarily blocks beta-1 receptors located in the heart.  These receptors are involved in increasing heart rate and contractility. By blocking these receptors, celiprolol lowers the heart rate and blood pressure.  It also possesses weak alpha-2 receptor-blocking activity, contributing to its vasodilating effects (widening of blood vessels), further reducing blood pressure and improving blood flow to the heart.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Celiprolol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or other beta-blockers, cardiogenic shock, decompensated heart failure, severe bradycardia, second- or third-degree heart block (unless a pacemaker is in place), severe peripheral arterial disease, sick sinus syndrome, untreated pheochromocytoma, acute asthma exacerbation, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe renal impairment (CrCl <15 mL/min), right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension, diabetic ketoacidosis, Raynaud phenomenon, uremia, and concomitant use with theophylline.

* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with first-degree heart block, diabetes mellitus, compensated heart failure, hepatic impairment, myasthenia gravis, mild-to-moderate renal impairment, peripheral vascular disease, a history of psoriasis, the elderly, or those with bronchospastic disease. Celiprolol should be used with caution during pregnancy (categories B in the first trimester and D in the second and third trimesters) and breastfeeding is not recommended.  Abrupt cessation should be avoided.


* **Drug Interactions:** Celiprolol can interact with many medications, including but not limited to other antihypertensives, calcium channel blockers, cardiac glycosides, insulin, and MAO inhibitors. Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive while taking Celiprolol?** A:  Celiprolol can cause dizziness and drowsiness. It's advisable to avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.

* **Q: How should I store Celiprolol?** A: Store Celiprolol as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Celiprolol suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop taking Celiprolol abruptly.  Sudden cessation can lead to serious cardiovascular complications.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Is Celiprolol suitable for everyone with hypertension or angina?** A: No, Celiprolol has contraindications and precautions that need to be carefully considered by your doctor before prescribing it.  This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.
