# Cetirizine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine
### Generic Name
Cetirizine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine

### Usage

This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold or upper respiratory allergies.  It combines three active ingredients, each targeting different symptoms:

* **Cetirizine:** This is an antihistamine that helps to alleviate runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes caused by allergies.  It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This is a cough suppressant (antitussive). It works in the brain to reduce the urge to cough. It's most effective against a dry, non-productive cough.  It won't help with a cough that produces mucus.

* **Phenylephrine:** This is a decongestant. It helps to relieve stuffiness in the nose and sinuses by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages. This reduces swelling and improves airflow.


This combination medicine is generally used for short-term symptom relief. It's not intended to treat the underlying cause of the illness, such as a viral infection.  


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (e.g., tablet, liquid) and the manufacturer.  Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by a doctor or pharmacist.  **Never exceed the recommended dose.**  This information is for general knowledge and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

* **Adults:**  Dosage typically ranges from one to two tablets or the equivalent amount of liquid every 4-6 hours, as needed.

* **Children:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on age and weight.  **Never give this medication to a child without consulting a pediatrician.**  Many formulations are not appropriate for children under a certain age.   The prescribing information will outline appropriate pediatric dosing based on age and weight.  Liquid formulations are often preferred for children.

* **Oral Administration:** Tablets or liquids should be taken with a full glass of water.


* **IV Administration:** This medication combination is not typically administered intravenously (IV).  Each ingredient would need to be administered separately, if indicated and under strict medical supervision.

**Important Note:**  The specific dosage should always be determined and supervised by a healthcare professional, particularly for children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing medical conditions.

* Drowsiness

### How it Works

This medication works through a combination of mechanisms:

* **Cetirizine (Antihistamine):** Blocks the action of histamine, reducing allergic symptoms like runny nose and sneezing.

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide (Antitussive):** Acts on the brain to suppress the cough reflex.

* **Phenylephrine (Decongestant):** Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and improving airflow.


By targeting different symptoms simultaneously, the combination provides comprehensive relief from cold and allergy symptoms.
