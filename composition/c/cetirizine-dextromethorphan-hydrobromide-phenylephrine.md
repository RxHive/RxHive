# Cetirizine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine

**Generic Name:** Cetirizine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or other upper respiratory allergies.  It's typically used for temporary relief of:

* **Runny nose:** Phenylephrine is a decongestant that helps shrink swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages.
* **Sneezing:** Cetirizine is an antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.
* **Itchy, watery eyes:**  Cetirizine helps alleviate these allergic symptoms.
* **Cough:** Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant that reduces the urge to cough.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is particularly associated with cetirizine and dextromethorphan.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth:** A common side effect of both antihistamines and decongestants.
* **Nausea:** Less common but possible.
* **Headache:**  Possible with any of the components.
* **Dizziness:**  Possible with any of the components.
* **Insomnia:**  Especially if taken later in the day.
* **Constipation:**  More likely with higher doses or prolonged use.
* **Increased heart rate:** More likely with phenylephrine, especially in those with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **High blood pressure:**  A potential side effect of phenylephrine.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions like rash, hives, or difficulty breathing are possible.


**How it Works:**

* **Cetirizine (Antihistamine):** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction, reducing symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide (Cough Suppressant):** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex. It doesn't treat the underlying cause of the cough.
* **Phenylephrine (Decongestant):**  Narrows blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
