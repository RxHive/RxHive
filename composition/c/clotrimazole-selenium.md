# Clotrimazole + Selenium
### Generic Name
Clotrimazole + Selenium Sulfide

**Note:**  While Clotrimazole and Selenium Sulfide are often used together to treat certain skin conditions, they are not typically combined into a single pharmaceutical formulation.  This information describes the individual actions and uses of each component when used in conjunction.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before using either medication.


### Usage

**Clotrimazole:** This is an antifungal medication used to treat various fungal infections of the skin, including athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), ringworm (tinea corporis), and yeast infections (candidiasis) of the skin.  It's also sometimes used to treat oral thrush (candidiasis of the mouth) but usually as a separate formulation.

**Selenium Sulfide:** This is an antifungal and antiseborrheic agent. Its primary use is in treating seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff) and tinea versicolor (a fungal skin infection causing discolored patches). It's also effective against certain types of fungal skin infections.

When used together, Clotrimazole and Selenium Sulfide often target infections involving both yeast and other fungi, as well as conditions like seborrheic dermatitis that might be complicated by secondary fungal infections.  The combination offers a broader spectrum of antifungal activity.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition, the product formulation (cream, lotion, shampoo), and the age and health of the patient.  There is no standardized combined dosage for Clotrimazole and Selenium Sulfide since they are typically used as separate medications.  

**Clotrimazole:**  Dosage instructions will be printed on the product label. For topical applications, this usually involves applying a thin layer to the affected area one to two times daily for a period of two to four weeks or as directed by a doctor.

**Selenium Sulfide:** For shampoos, the instructions will typically advise applying to wet hair, lathering, leaving it on for a specific amount of time (often 10 minutes), and then rinsing thoroughly. This might be used once or twice a week. For topical creams or lotions, again the specific instructions on the label should be followed.

**Children and IV administration:**  Clotrimazole is not typically administered intravenously (IV).  Selenium Sulfide is also primarily a topical medication and not typically administered intravenously. Pediatric dosages for both need to be determined by a doctor based on the child's age, weight, and condition.  


### Side Effects

**Clotrimazole:**

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Mild redness or irritation
* Skin rash

Rare but serious side effects are very uncommon with topical application.

**Selenium Sulfide:**

* Burning or stinging sensation
* Skin irritation or redness
* Hair discoloration (temporary)
* Itching


If any of these side effects are severe or persistent, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

**Clotrimazole:**  This medication disrupts the formation of ergosterol, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes. This damage weakens the cell membrane, leading to leakage of cellular contents and ultimately killing the fungus.

**Selenium Sulfide:** The exact mechanism is not completely understood, but it is believed to disrupt fungal cell metabolism and inhibit fungal growth. Its antiseborrheic action likely involves reducing the scaling and inflammation associated with seborrheic dermatitis.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Individuals with known allergies to clotrimazole, selenium sulfide, or any other components of the medication should avoid use.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult a doctor before using either medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Interactions with Other Drugs:**  There are no significant known interactions with many common medications, but inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Damaged Skin:** Avoid application to broken or severely damaged skin.
* **Eyes and Mucous Membranes:** Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes; rinse thoroughly with water if accidental contact occurs.
* **Children:** Use under adult supervision and according to a doctor's instructions.
