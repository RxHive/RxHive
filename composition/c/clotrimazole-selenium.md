# Clotrimazole + Selenium

**Generic Name:** Clotrimazole + Selenium Sulfide

**Usage:** This combination medication is primarily used topically to treat seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff) and tinea versicolor (a fungal skin infection).  Clotrimazole targets the fungal component, while selenium sulfide combats yeast and scales associated with these conditions.  Specific application instructions will vary depending on the product formulation (e.g., shampoo, cream).  Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by a doctor or pharmacist.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and uncommon. They can include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, stinging, redness, itching, or dryness at the application site.
* **Hair discoloration:** Selenium sulfide can temporarily discolor light-colored hair.  This is usually temporary and resolves after discontinuation.
* **Allergic reactions:** In rare cases, allergic reactions such as rash or hives may occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Clotrimazole:** This is an antifungal medication that works by interfering with the fungal cell membrane's synthesis, disrupting its function and ultimately killing the fungus.  It's effective against a broad spectrum of dermatophytes (fungi that cause skin infections).

* **Selenium Sulfide:** This is an antifungaland anti-inflammatory agent. Its exact mechanism isn't completely understood, but it's thought to disrupt the growth and reproduction of Malassezia globosa (a yeast frequently associated with seborrheic dermatitis) and also reduce inflammation and scaling.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?**  Improvement is usually seen within a few weeks of consistent use.  However, the duration of treatment may vary depending on the severity of the condition.

* **Can I use this during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Consult your doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  The safety of clotrimazole and selenium sulfide in these circumstances hasn't been fully established.

* **What if I miss a dose?** Apply the medication as soon as you remember. If it's almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. Do not double the dose.

* **Can I use this with other medications?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all other medications you are using, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, as interactions may occur.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** If you experience any significant or persistent side effects, discontinue use and consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.
