# Cefpodoxime Proxetil + Dicloxacillin

It's crucial to understand that there is **no commercially available combination drug containing both Cefpodoxime Proxetil and Dicloxacillin.**  These are two distinct antibiotics used for different purposes and are not typically prescribed together.  Prescribing a combination of antibiotics requires careful consideration of the specific infection and the potential for drug interactions.

Therefore, the following information will address each drug *individually*.  **Do not attempt to combine these medications without explicit instruction from a qualified medical professional.**


**Cefpodoxime Proxetil:**

**Generic Name:** Cefpodoxime Proxetil

**Usage:** Cefpodoxime proxetil is a cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, including:

* Infections of the ears (otitis media)
* Infections of the sinuses (sinusitis)
* Infections of the respiratory tract (bronchitis, pneumonia â€“ in some cases)
* Skin infections
* Urinary tract infections (UTIs)


**Side Effects:** Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and headache.  Less common but more serious side effects can include allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling),  pseudomembranous colitis (severe intestinal inflammation), and changes in blood counts.


**How it Works:** Cefpodoxime proxetil works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to build cell walls, ultimately leading to their death.


**Dicloxacillin:**

**Generic Name:** Dicloxacillin

**Usage:** Dicloxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin antibiotic primarily used to treat infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (staph) bacteria. This includes:

* Skin infections (e.g., impetigo, cellulitis)
* Infections of the bone (osteomyelitis)
* Lung infections (pneumonia - in specific cases)

**Side Effects:** Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.  More serious, although less frequent, side effects can include allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling),  pseudomembranous colitis, and liver inflammation.


**How it Works:** Dicloxacillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.  Its penicillinase resistance means it is effective against staph bacteria that produce the enzyme penicillinase, which usually breaks down penicillin antibiotics.


**FAQs (separate for each drug):**

**Cefpodoxime Proxetil FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take Cefpodoxime Proxetil with alcohol?** A:  While not explicitly contraindicated in all cases, it's best to avoid alcohol while taking Cefpodoxime Proxetil as it could potentially increase the risk of side effects.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.
* **Q: How long should I take Cefpodoxime Proxetil?** A:  The duration of treatment depends on the infection and your doctor's instructions.  Complete the entire course of antibiotics even if you feel better.

**Dicloxacillin FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take Dicloxacillin with dairy products?** A:  It's generally recommended to avoid dairy products within a couple of hours of taking Dicloxacillin as calcium can reduce the absorption of the antibiotic.
* **Q: What should I do if I have an allergic reaction?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction such as rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.
* **Q: How long should I take Dicloxacillin?** A:  The duration of treatment depends on the infection and your doctor's instructions.  Complete the full course.
