# Cisplatin
### Generic Name
Cisplatin

### Usage

Cisplatin is a chemotherapy medication, a type of antineoplastic drug, used to treat various cancers.  Its primary use is in treating several types of advanced cancers, including:

* **Bladder cancer:**  Cisplatin is often part of combination chemotherapy regimens for advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.
* **Ovarian cancer:** It's a key component of treatment plans for advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer, frequently used in combination with other drugs.
* **Testicular cancer:**  Cisplatin is crucial in treating various types of testicular cancer, especially germ cell tumors.

While these are its primary applications, cisplatin is also used in off-label settings (meaning its use isn't officially approved by regulatory bodies for these conditions but is sometimes prescribed by oncologists) to treat a broader range of cancers, including:  head and neck cancers, lung cancers (both small cell and non-small cell),  cervical cancer,  and certain types of  brain tumors and other solid tumors.  The use of cisplatin in these contexts often involves combination therapy with other chemotherapeutic agents and/or radiation.


### Dosage

Cisplatin dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the type and stage of cancer, the patient's overall health, and kidney function (creatinine clearance, or CrCl).  Dosage is typically expressed as milligrams per square meter of body surface area (mg/m²) or milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg).  The administration route is almost always intravenous (IV).

**Adult Dosage:**  The dosage for adults varies greatly depending on the cancer being treated and the specific treatment regimen.  Examples include:

* **Bladder cancer:**  50-70 mg/m² every 3-4 weeks or other regimens involving different dosages and schedules combined with other drugs.
* **Ovarian cancer:** 75-100 mg/m² every 3-4 weeks or other regimens.
* **Testicular cancer:** Often administered as part of combination therapy (e.g., BEP regimen), with cisplatin doses ranging from 20 to 25 mg/m² per day for several days within a treatment cycle.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children is significantly different and is calculated based on weight (mg/kg) and body surface area,  always under the careful supervision of a pediatric oncologist.   Regimens used in pediatric oncology are often combinations involving cisplatin along with other medications like etoposide and bleomycin (e.g., in treating germ cell tumors).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Cisplatin is significantly nephrotoxic (harmful to the kidneys).  Dosage adjustments, or even avoidance of cisplatin entirely, are necessary for patients with impaired kidney function.  Dosage may also need to be modified based on other factors, including liver function, bone marrow suppression (low blood cell counts), or other side effects.

**Administration:**  Cisplatin is always administered intravenously.  The infusion rate is typically controlled to minimize side effects.  It is crucial to follow the prescribed infusion rate and schedule closely.


### Side Effects

Cisplatin's potent anti-cancer effects come with significant side effects.  The most common side effects include:

* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Often severe and requiring strong antiemetic (anti-nausea) medications.
* **Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity):** This can range from mild impairment to acute kidney failure.  Kidney function is closely monitored during treatment.
* **Nerve damage (neurotoxicity):** Can manifest as numbness, tingling, or pain in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy), or other neurological issues.
* **Hearing loss (ototoxicity):** Can be permanent in severe cases.
* **Low blood cell counts (myelosuppression):**  Increases the risk of infection, bleeding, and anemia.
* **Other possible side effects:**  Mouth sores, constipation, diarrhea, fatigue, hair loss (alopecia), and allergic reactions.

Some less common but serious side effects include heart problems,  liver damage,  and second cancers.  Any unusual or concerning symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Cisplatin is a DNA-damaging agent.  It works by binding to DNA within cancer cells, preventing them from replicating and ultimately leading to their death.  The drug's platinum atoms form cross-links between DNA strands, disrupting the DNA's structure and function.  This interferes with the cancer cell's ability to divide and grow, eventually leading to cell death.  Importantly, cisplatin affects both normal and cancerous cells.

### Precautions

* **Kidney function:** Cisplatin is very hard on the kidneys.  Patients with pre-existing kidney problems or those who develop kidney problems during treatment may require dosage adjustments or alternative therapies.  Careful monitoring of kidney function is essential.
* **Hearing:** Cisplatin can cause hearing loss (ototoxicity).  Hearing tests may be done before and during treatment.
* **Nerves:** Cisplatin can damage nerves (peripheral neuropathy).  Regular neurological assessments are necessary to detect and manage nerve problems.
* **Blood counts:**  Cisplatin frequently causes low blood cell counts (myelosuppression). Regular blood tests are crucial to monitor this.
* **Allergies:**  Patients with a history of severe allergic reactions to platinum-containing compounds should not receive cisplatin.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Cisplatin is extremely harmful to a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age must use effective contraception during and after treatment.  Breastfeeding is contraindicated.
* **Drug interactions:**  Cisplatin can interact with other medications.  It is essential to inform your doctor of all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does cisplatin treatment last?**  A: The duration varies greatly depending on the type of cancer, stage, treatment response, and other factors. It can range from several weeks to several months.

* **Q:  Are there any ways to manage cisplatin side effects?**  A: Yes, many strategies help manage side effects.  These include antiemetic medications for nausea and vomiting,  aggressive hydration to protect the kidneys,  supportive care measures (such as blood transfusions for anemia), and medication to manage nerve pain.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.  Severe side effects require prompt medical attention.

* **Q: How is cisplatin stored?** A:  Follow your pharmacist’s instructions carefully.  Generally, cisplatin should be stored at a controlled room temperature away from light and moisture.

* **Q:  Can I drive while on cisplatin?** A: This depends on the side effects you experience.  If you feel tired, dizzy, or have impaired vision or coordination, avoid driving.
