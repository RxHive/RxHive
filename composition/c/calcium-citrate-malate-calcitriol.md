# Calcium Citrate Malate + Calcitriol
### Generic Name
Calcium Citrate Malate + Calcitriol

**Note:**  This combination is not a single, pre-packaged generic medicine readily available in all markets.  Calcium citrate malate and calcitriol are often prescribed together, but the formulation and specific ratios will vary depending on the prescribing physician and the patient's individual needs.  This information provides general guidance on the individual components and their combined use.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.


### Usage

This combination is primarily used to treat hypocalcemia (low blood calcium) and secondary hyperparathyroidism (overactive parathyroid glands) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).  The calcium citrate malate provides readily absorbable calcium, while calcitriol (a form of vitamin D) helps to regulate calcium absorption from the gut and its levels in the blood.  Calcitriol also helps to suppress the overactivity of the parathyroid glands.  The combined effect helps to maintain healthy calcium levels and improves overall bone health in patients with CKD.  In some cases, this combination may also be used to treat other conditions involving calcium deficiency, but this is less common and should be guided by a physician's assessment.


### Dosage

Dosage for both calcium citrate malate and calcitriol are highly individualized and depend on factors such as the patient's age, weight, kidney function (especially for calcitriol), the severity of hypocalcemia, and the presence of other medical conditions.  There's no single standard dosage.

* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** The dosage of calcium citrate malate is determined by the patient's calcium needs and levels. It's often administered orally as tablets or capsules. The doctor will typically prescribe a specific amount based on blood tests monitoring calcium levels.

* **Calcitriol:**  Calcitriol dosage is carefully titrated, meaning it is adjusted based on regular monitoring of blood calcium levels and parathyroid hormone levels. The initial dose is generally low and is gradually increased as needed under close medical supervision. It's usually administered orally as a capsule or solution, though other forms (e.g., topical or injection) exist but are less common for this indication.

**Children and IV Administration:** The use of this combination in children and intravenous administration are not standard practices. Both calcium and calcitriol are often given separately via IV when necessary in children or adults.  Dosage and administration are strictly determined by the doctor depending on the child's age, weight, and clinical condition. IV calcitriol is very rarely utilized.

**Important:**  Never adjust the dosage of either medication on your own. Always follow the prescribed instructions and attend all follow-up appointments for monitoring of calcium and parathyroid hormone levels.


### Side Effects

* Constipation
* Nausea

* Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)


**Important:**  If you experience any side effects, particularly serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** Provides easily absorbable calcium, which is essential for various bodily functions, including muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and maintaining strong bones.

* **Calcitriol:**  Acts as a hormone that increases calcium absorption from the intestines and promotes calcium reabsorption from the kidneys. It also suppresses the production of parathyroid hormone, which helps to regulate calcium levels in the blood.  The combined effect helps to correct low calcium levels and improve bone health.


### Precautions

* **Kidney disease:** Calcitriol needs to be carefully monitored in individuals with kidney problems as it can be difficult to excrete.
* **Hypercalcemia:**  Individuals with high calcium levels should not take this combination.
* **Heart problems:**  High calcium levels can worsen certain heart conditions.
* **Pregnant and breastfeeding women:** Use should be carefully considered and monitored under strict medical supervision due to potential effects on the developing fetus and infant.
* **Drug Interactions:** Calcitriol can interact with several medications, including digoxin, diuretics, and other drugs affecting calcium metabolism. Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take this combination?** A:  The duration of treatment depends on your individual needs and is determined by your doctor based on your blood calcium levels and overall health.

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other supplements or medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications and supplements you are taking to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
