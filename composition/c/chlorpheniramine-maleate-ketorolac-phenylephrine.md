# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ketorolac + Phenylephrine

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ketorolac + Phenylephrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold, flu, or other upper respiratory allergies.  It combines the actions of an antihistamine (chlorpheniramine maleate), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) (ketorolac), and a nasal decongestant (phenylephrine).  It's intended to relieve symptoms such as:

* **Runny nose:** Chlorpheniramine and phenylephrine address this.
* **Sneezing:** Chlorpheniramine addresses this.
* **Itchy, watery eyes:** Chlorpheniramine addresses this.
* **Congestion:** Phenylephrine addresses this.
* **Pain and fever:** Ketorolac addresses this (though usually not fever in this combination; it's primarily for pain relief).

**Important Note:** This combination is usually only for short-term use (a few days) to treat mild to moderate symptoms.  It is not a cure for the underlying illness.  Always follow the prescribed dosage and duration.  This combination is not appropriate for everyone and should only be taken as directed by a healthcare professional.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dose. Common side effects may include:

* **Drowsiness:** Chlorpheniramine is a sedating antihistamine.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be caused by any of the three components.
* **Headache:** Can be caused by any of the three components or as a symptom of the underlying illness.
* **Nausea:**  Often associated with ketorolac.
* **Upset stomach:**  Often associated with ketorolac.
* **Dry mouth:**  Often associated with chlorpheniramine and phenylephrine.
* **Constipation:** Can occur.
* **Increased heart rate:**  More likely with higher doses of phenylephrine.
* **Increased blood pressure:**  More likely with higher doses of phenylephrine.
* **Stomach ulcers or bleeding:**  A serious, though rare, risk associated with ketorolac.


**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate (Antihistamine):** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. This helps to reduce sneezing, runny nose, and itchy, watery eyes.
* **Ketorolac (NSAID):** Reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to pain and swelling.
* **Phenylephrine (Decongestant):** Narrows blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
