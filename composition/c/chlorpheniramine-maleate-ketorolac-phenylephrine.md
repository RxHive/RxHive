# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ketorolac + Phenylephrine
### Generic Name
Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ketorolac + Phenylephrine


### Usage

This combination medication is typically used to provide temporary relief from symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, allergies, and sinusitis.  It works by targeting several symptoms simultaneously:

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine that helps reduce runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes caused by allergies or the common cold.  It blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body in response to allergens.

* **Ketorolac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation. It's particularly effective for relieving headache, muscle aches, and sinus pain often associated with the conditions listed above.

* **Phenylephrine:** This is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages, providing relief from nasal congestion. It helps to open up the airways, making breathing easier.


This combination is designed for symptomatic relief only.  It does *not* treat the underlying cause of the illness.  If symptoms persist or worsen, or if a fever develops, medical advice should be sought.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation (e.g., tablet, capsule, liquid) and the manufacturer.  **Always follow the directions on the product label or as advised by your doctor or pharmacist.**  There is no universally standardized dosage for this combination, as the ratios of each ingredient can differ between brands.  

**This information should not be used in place of directions on the medication packaging.  Improper dosing can lead to health problems.**


Generally, this combination medication is not recommended for children without explicit direction from a pediatrician.  The use in pregnant or breastfeeding women requires careful consultation with a doctor.  IV administration is not typical for this combination; these drugs are usually administered orally.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Headache
* Upset stomach
* Difficulty sleeping
* Increased heart rate
* Constipation
* Nervousness

Less common, but more serious side effects, may include allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), stomach ulcers or bleeding, and liver problems.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these serious side effects.


### How it Works

As detailed in the "Usage" section, each component of this combination medication works through a different mechanism to target specific symptoms:

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate** blocks histamine receptors, preventing histamine from binding and causing allergic symptoms.

* **Ketorolac** inhibits the production of prostaglandins, inflammatory chemicals responsible for pain and swelling.

* **Phenylephrine** acts as a sympathomimetic, stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in blood vessels, causing them to constrict and reduce nasal congestion.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Do not use this medication if you are allergic to any of its components.
* **Other Medications:** Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  Interactions are possible with certain blood thinners, other NSAIDs, and certain heart medications.
* **Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision due to potential risks to the mother and child.
* **Liver or Kidney Disease:** Use caution if you have liver or kidney problems.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **High Blood Pressure or Heart Conditions:** This medication may worsen high blood pressure or exacerbate existing heart conditions. Consult your doctor before use.
* **Glaucoma:** Phenylephrine can worsen glaucoma.  Avoid use if you have glaucoma.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Drowsiness is a common side effect.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if you feel drowsy.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while using this medication, as it can increase the risk of side effects.
