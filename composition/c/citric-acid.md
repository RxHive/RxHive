# Citric Acid
### Generic Name
Citric Acid

### Usage
Citric acid is primarily used as a nutritional supplement and to relieve mouth and throat irritation.  It's often a component in cough syrups and lozenges to soothe sore throats and coughs. While not a primary treatment for any specific disease, its demulcent properties offer symptomatic relief for discomfort in the mouth and throat.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the formulation (syrup, lozenges, etc.) and the intended use.  Always follow the instructions on the product label.

**Adult Dosage (example for cough syrup, 125mg/5mL):** 5 mL up to four times daily.  This is an example; specific instructions depend on the product.

**Pediatric Dosage (example for cough syrup):**
* **Children aged 1–5 years:** 5 mL of a pediatric syrup (e.g., 31.25 mg/5mL) up to four times daily.
* **Children aged 6–12 years:** 10 mL of a pediatric syrup (e.g., 31.25 mg/5mL) up to four times daily.
* **Children over 12 years and adolescents:**  5 mL of an adult syrup (e.g., 125 mg/5mL) up to four times daily.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The provided information does not specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for guidance if you have any kidney or liver problems.

### Side Effects
Generally, citric acid is considered safe, and serious side effects are rare.  However, some formulations might contain other ingredients (like sugar or lactose) that could cause adverse reactions in susceptible individuals.  There are no adverse reactions specifically listed in the provided manufacturer's labeling.

### How it Works
Citric acid acts as a demulcent. This means it soothes irritated mucous membranes in the mouth and throat by creating a protective film that reduces friction and irritation.  This helps alleviate symptoms of coughs and sore throats.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Citric acid is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to citric acid or any component of the formulation.
* **Use with caution:** Exercise caution when using formulations containing citric acid if you have diabetes (due to potential sugar content), lactose intolerance (due to potential lactose content), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), or are a neonate.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Limited information exists regarding the use of citric acid during pregnancy and lactation.  Always consult with a healthcare professional before using any medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
