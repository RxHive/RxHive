# Clascoterone
### Generic Name
Clascoterone

### Usage
Clascoterone is a topical medication used to treat acne vulgaris (common acne) in patients aged 12 years and older.  Its primary function is to reduce the production of sebum (oil) by the skin's sebaceous glands, a key factor contributing to acne.  By decreasing sebum production, it helps to prevent the formation of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and reduces inflammation associated with acne lesions.  Currently, it does not have any other notable secondary uses approved by regulatory agencies.

### Dosage
**Acne Vulgaris:**

* **Adults and Children â‰¥12 years:** Clascoterone 1% cream is applied as a thin layer to the affected areas of skin twice daily (BID), once in the morning and once in the evening.  The safety and efficacy of Clascoterone in children under 12 years of age have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, based on current manufacturer labeling.

### Side Effects

* **Common (more than 10%):**  Skin exfoliation (peeling), dry skin (xeroderma).
* **Less Common (1-10%):** Atrophic striae (thin, indented streaks on the skin).
* **Less Frequent (frequency not defined):** Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression (affecting hormone production), hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood), polycystic ovary syndrome (hormonal imbalance).

**Important Note:**  If you experience any side effects, especially unusual or severe ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Clascoterone works by inhibiting androgen receptors.  Androgens are hormones that stimulate sebum production. By blocking the action of these hormones, particularly dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Clascoterone reduces sebum production and, consequently, the inflammatory processes that contribute to acne.  While the precise mechanism isn't fully understood, the reduction in sebum and inflammation lies at the heart of its effectiveness.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Limited information is available on the effects of topical Clascoterone during pregnancy. The potential risk to the infant and the benefits of breastfeeding versus the benefits of treatment for the mother should be considered. Excretion into breast milk is unknown.
* **Local Irritation:**  Clascoterone may cause local skin irritation (pruritus, burning, redness, or peeling).
* **HPA Axis Suppression and Hyperkalemia:**  There's a potential risk of HPA axis suppression (affecting hormone production) and hyperkalemia (high potassium).
* **Children:** Children may absorb proportionally more Clascoterone, potentially increasing the risk of systemic effects.  Growth monitoring is recommended during prolonged use in pediatric patients.
* **Concomitant Topical Products:** Avoid using Clascoterone with other harsh topical products (medicated soaps, abrasive cleansers, strong drying agents, products with high alcohol content, etc.) to minimize irritation.
* **Occlusive Dressings:** Using occlusive dressings increases Clascoterone absorption.
* **Large Surface Area Application:** Applying to large skin areas increases absorption.
* **Prolonged Use:** Prolonged use increases absorption and the risk of side effects.
