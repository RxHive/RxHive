# Clotrimazole + Zinc Oxide

**Generic Name:** Clotrimazole + Zinc Oxide

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical antifungal and protectant used to treat various skin conditions, primarily:

* **Diaper rash:**  The zinc oxide provides a protective barrier, while clotrimazole combats any fungal or yeast infection contributing to the rash.
* **Intertrigo:**  This is a skin irritation that often occurs in skin folds (e.g., groin, underarms) due to moisture and friction, sometimes exacerbated by fungal or yeast infections.
* **Other minor skin infections:**  It can be used for other minor skin infections where a protective barrier and antifungal action are beneficial.

**Note:**  This combination is not suitable for all skin conditions. Always consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment before using this or any other medication.


**Side Effects:**  Generally well-tolerated, side effects are uncommon but can include:

* **Burning or stinging:** At the application site. This is usually mild and temporary.
* **Irritation or redness:** At the application site.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, an allergic reaction (rash, itching, swelling) is possible. Stop use and seek medical attention if this occurs.

**How it Works:**

* **Clotrimazole:** This is an antifungal medication that works by disrupting the cell membranes of fungi, specifically yeasts and dermatophytes (fungi that cause skin infections). This disruption leads to fungal cell death.
* **Zinc Oxide:**  This is a protectant that creates a barrier on the skin. This barrier protects the affected area from further irritation, moisture, and potential infection.  It also has mild astringent and antiseptic properties.

The combined action of clotrimazole and zinc oxide provides both treatment for fungal infection and protection for the irritated skin.
