# Cetirizine (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Cetirizine (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Cetirizine ophthalmic solution is primarily used to treat the itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.  Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye) caused by an allergic reaction, often to pollen, dust mites, or pet dander.  It's specifically targeted at relieving the symptom of itching, not the underlying allergic reaction itself.

### Dosage

**Allergic Conjunctivitis:**

* **Adults and Children â‰¥2 years:**  Instill one drop of 0.24% solution in the affected eye(s) twice daily, approximately 8 hours apart.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before adjusting the dosage based on individual health conditions.

**Important Administration Notes:** Avoid touching the dropper tip to any surface, including eyelids or fingers, to prevent contamination. Wash your hands before using the medication. Remove contact lenses before application and wait at least 10 minutes before reinserting them.  Use single-use containers immediately after opening.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of users):

* Local pain at the site of instillation.
* Decreased visual acuity (blurred vision).
* Ocular hyperemia (redness of the eye).

Less common, but potentially serious side effects:  While rare with ophthalmic cetirizine, serious side effects similar to those seen with oral cetirizine (such as allergic reactions) are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or unusual symptoms.


### How it Works

Cetirizine is a histamine H1-receptor antagonist. Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction, causing inflammation and itching.  Cetirizine works by blocking the histamine receptors in the eye, preventing histamine from binding and thus reducing the itching sensation. It also may have other effects, such as decreasing the movement of white blood cells to the site of inflammation (chemotaxis) and inhibiting the activation of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell involved in allergic responses).

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling for the ophthalmic formulation.
* **Increased Risk:** There's an increased risk of eye injury and contamination if proper hygiene and administration techniques are not followed.
* **Use with Caution:**  Use with caution in contact lens wearers.  Remove contact lenses before application and wait at least 10 minutes to reinsert. Cetirizine ophthalmic should not be used to treat contact lens-related irritation.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of ophthalmic cetirizine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  If use is necessary during pregnancy, the lowest effective dose should be used, and punctal occlusion (gently pressing on the inner corner of the eye to reduce drainage into the tear duct) may be helpful to minimize systemic exposure. Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
