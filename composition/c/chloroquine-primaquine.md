# Chloroquine + Primaquine
### Generic Name
Chloroquine Phosphate + Primaquine Phosphate

### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used to treat malaria caused by *Plasmodium vivax* and *Plasmodium ovale*.  These species of malaria parasites are unique because they can lie dormant in the liver (hypnozoites) and cause relapses of the disease weeks or months after the initial infection. Chloroquine effectively kills the parasites in the blood, treating the active infection. Primaquine, on the other hand, targets and eliminates the liver hypnozoites, preventing relapses.  Chloroquine alone is insufficient for preventing relapses caused by *P. vivax* and *P. ovale*.  This combination therapy is therefore crucial for a complete cure.  While sometimes used in combination with other antimalarials for severe or resistant malaria, this specific combination is primarily indicated for *P. vivax* and *P. ovale* infections.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the infection.  It's **crucial** to follow the prescription provided by a healthcare professional exactly.  Self-medication with antimalarials is dangerous and can be ineffective or even harmful.  

**General guidance (this is NOT a substitute for a doctor's prescription):**

* **Adults:** The typical dose involves a loading dose of Chloroquine followed by a daily dose for several days, along with a daily dose of Primaquine for a specified duration. This regimen is usually prescribed for 14 days but the precise duration and doses of each medicine must come from your physician. The dose of Primaquine is particularly crucial as exceeding it can lead to serious side effects.
* **Children:**  Dosage for children is strictly weight-based and determined by the physician based on age and other factors.  It is never appropriate to administer adult dosages to children.
* **Oral Administration:**  Both Chloroquine and Primaquine are usually administered orally as tablets or syrup (depending on the formulation and patient). 
* **IV Administration:** Intravenous administration of this combination is not typically done. Intravenous formulations of Chloroquine may be used in severe malaria, but this will not be in conjunction with Primaquine.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, blurred vision.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These can include severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis),  blood disorders (hemolytic anemia â€“ particularly concerning with Primaquine, especially in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency), liver damage, heart problems, and neurological issues.
* **Note:** If any of these side effects occur, especially severe ones, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Chloroquine works by interfering with the parasite's ability to digest hemoglobin, a crucial protein in red blood cells. This ultimately leads to the death of the parasite within red blood cells. Primaquine, on the other hand, targets the hypnozoites in the liver, preventing relapse by preventing their maturation. It does this through its oxidative properties, damaging the parasites' DNA.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This combination should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity to either Chloroquine or Primaquine.  Primaquine is absolutely contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency as it can trigger severe hemolytic anemia.
* **Drug Interactions:** Many drugs can interact with Chloroquine and Primaquine, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects. Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of this medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  A healthcare professional should assess the situation carefully and guide the decision.
* **G6PD Deficiency:**  Testing for G6PD deficiency is essential before prescribing Primaquine, as this enzyme deficiency significantly increases the risk of severe hemolytic anemia.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Caution is needed in patients with kidney or liver problems, as these organs play a vital role in the metabolism and excretion of both drugs.  Dosage adjustments may be required.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to the side effects of Chloroquine and Primaquine. Close monitoring is necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication without a doctor's prescription?**  A: No, absolutely not.  Antimalarial medications should only be taken under the guidance of a healthcare professional who can properly diagnose the infection and determine the appropriate dosage and treatment duration.  Self-medication can be dangerous and ineffective.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store this medication in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and out of the reach of children. Follow the storage instructions provided on the packaging.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.  If you have concerns, contact your physician.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of this medication?** A: While usually well-tolerated for the prescribed duration, long-term use of these medications may increase the risk of certain side effects.  It is critical only to use them as directed by a physician for the treatment of malaria and not for other purposes.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication, as it can increase the risk of side effects like nausea and vomiting. Consult with your doctor for specific guidance.
