# Chloroquine + Primaquine

**Generic Name:** Chloroquine Phosphate + Primaquine Phosphate

**Usage:**  This combination is used to treat malaria caused by *Plasmodium vivax* and *Plasmodium ovale*.  It's crucial to note that chloroquine alone is not effective against the liver stages of these parasites (hypnozoites), which can lead to relapses. Primaquine is added specifically to eliminate these hypnozoites and prevent relapse.  This combination is *not* effective against malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*, a more dangerous species.  The prescription and dosage should always be determined by a physician based on the patient's age, weight, and specific malaria infection.  Self-medication is extremely dangerous.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the dosage and individual sensitivity. Common side effects include:

* **Chloroquine:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, skin rash, itching.  Less common but more serious side effects include changes in heart rhythm,  blood disorders, and eye damage (retinopathy).
* **Primaquine:**  Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness. More serious side effects, particularly in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, include hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells), which can be life-threatening.  Primaquine should never be given to those with known G6PD deficiency.

**How it Works:**

* **Chloroquine:**  Chloroquine works by interfering with the parasite's ability to break down and utilize heme, a byproduct of hemoglobin digestion within the parasite.  The accumulation of heme is toxic to the parasite, leading to its death. It primarily acts against the blood stages of the malaria parasite.
* **Primaquine:** Primaquine is a blood schizonticide and a tissue schizonticide.  It acts against the asexual blood stages and, importantly, the dormant hypnozoites in the liver of *P. vivax* and *P. ovale*.  This prevents relapse of the infection.  It achieves this by interfering with parasite mitochondrial function.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take this medication without a doctor's prescription?** A: No. Malaria treatment requires careful diagnosis and monitoring. Self-medication can be dangerous and ineffective, potentially leading to severe complications or death.
* **Q: Is this medication effective against all types of malaria?** A: No. It is effective against malaria caused by *Plasmodium vivax* and *Plasmodium ovale* but not *Plasmodium falciparum* or *Plasmodium malariae*.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or severe side effects.
* **Q: Do I need a G6PD test before taking this medication?** A: Yes, a G6PD test is crucial before starting primaquine, especially since hemolytic anemia is a serious risk for those with G6PD deficiency.
* **Q: How long will I need to take this medication?** A: The duration of treatment will be determined by your doctor and depends on the severity of the infection.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication, as it can increase the risk of side effects.  Consult your doctor for specific advice.
* **Q:  Can I take this medication if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  The use of this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with a doctor.  The risks and benefits need to be weighed individually.
