# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Menthol + Phenylephrine + Sodium Citrate

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Menthol + Phenylephrine + Sodium Citrate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to temporarily relieve symptoms associated with the common cold or other upper respiratory allergies.  The specific symptoms it targets are:

* **Runny nose:** Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages.
* **Sneezing:** Chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.
* **Itching:** Both chlorpheniramine and menthol can provide relief from itching. Menthol has a cooling effect that soothes irritated nasal passages.
* **Congestion:** Phenylephrine addresses nasal congestion.
* **Cough (sometimes):** While not a primary use, some formulations might include ingredients to help with a cough, though this is not always the case with this specific combination. Sodium citrate can help thin mucus, which may indirectly aid in cough relief.


**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a frequent side effect of chlorpheniramine.
* **Dry mouth:** A common side effect of both antihistamines and decongestants.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Insomnia:**  Especially if taken later in the day.
* **Irritability:**
* **Nervousness:** More common with phenylephrine.
* **Increased heart rate:**  A potential effect of phenylephrine.
* **High blood pressure:**  A potential effect of phenylephrine.


**More serious side effects are rare but should be reported to a doctor immediately. These can include:** allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain.


**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate (antihistamine):** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released during allergic reactions, reducing sneezing and runny nose.
* **Phenylephrine (decongestant):** Narrows blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Menthol (topical analgesic/counterirritant):** Creates a cooling sensation that can soothe irritated nasal passages and provide temporary relief from itching.
* **Sodium Citrate (expectorant):** Helps to thin mucus, making it easier to cough up.  Its effect on cough relief in this specific combination is often indirect and less prominent than the other components.
