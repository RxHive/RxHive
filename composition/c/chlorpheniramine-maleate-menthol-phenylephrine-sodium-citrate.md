# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Menthol + Phenylephrine + Sodium Citrate
### Generic Name
Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Menthol + Phenylephrine + Sodium Citrate


This combination is typically found in over-the-counter (OTC) cold and allergy medications.  There isn't a single generic name for this specific four-drug combination as manufacturers may vary slightly in formulation.  Each ingredient has its own generic name and works to address different symptoms of the common cold or allergies.


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used for symptomatic relief of the common cold and allergies.  The individual components target different symptoms:

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that reduces runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes associated with allergies and colds.
* **Menthol:** A topical decongestant that provides a cooling sensation, potentially relieving nasal congestion. It works by stimulating cold receptors in the nasal passages.
* **Phenylephrine:** A nasal decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.
* **Sodium Citrate:** An expectorant, helping to thin mucus and make it easier to cough up, easing chest congestion.


This combination is designed to address multiple cold and allergy symptoms simultaneously â€“  runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes, nasal congestion, and chest congestion.  It's important to note that this medication only treats *symptoms*; it doesn't cure the underlying illness (viral infection or allergic reaction).


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific product formulation (e.g., liquid, tablet, capsule).  Always refer to the product label for the exact dosage instructions.  **Never exceed the recommended dose.**  Generally, dosage is tailored to the age and weight of the patient.  This information is usually clearly outlined on the product packaging for adults and children, often specifying different dosages based on age groups.  Liquid formulations often include dosing syringes or cups for accurate measurement.  There are no IV forms of this combination medication.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a common side effect of chlorpheniramine maleate.
* **Dry mouth:** A frequent side effect of antihistamines.
* **Headache:** A relatively common side effect.
* **Nausea:** Less common but possible.
* **Dizziness:**  Can occur, especially in higher doses.
* **Insomnia:**  May be experienced, particularly if taken later in the day.
* **Increased heart rate:** A potential side effect of phenylephrine.
* **High blood pressure:**  Possible, especially in individuals with pre-existing hypertension.

Less common but more serious side effects may include allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling).  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

The components of this medication work synergistically:

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released during allergic reactions that causes many allergy symptoms.
* **Menthol:** Creates a cooling sensation that can temporarily relieve nasal congestion by stimulating cold receptors.
* **Phenylephrine:** Narrows blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Sodium Citrate:** Helps thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up.
