# Cefixime + Ornidazole

**Generic Name:** Cefixime + Ornidazole

**Usage:**  Cefixime + Ornidazole is a combination antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal tract.  Specific infections it's used for include:

* **Infections of the respiratory tract:**  Some bacterial pneumonias, bronchitis (depending on the causative organism).
* **Infections of the urinary tract:**  Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by susceptible bacteria.
* **Gastrointestinal infections:**  Diarrhea, dysentery, and other infections caused by susceptible bacteria.  It is often prescribed for infections suspected to be caused by bacteria along with parasites.

**Important Note:** This combination is not effective against all bacterial or parasitic infections.  A doctor should determine if this is the right medication based on the specific infection and its causative agent.  Broad-spectrum antibiotics are often used for suspected infections before culture results are available.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person, but some common ones include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite.  These are more common with Ornidazole.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue (angioedema), difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis).  These are more common with Cefixime, a cephalosporin antibiotic.
* **Nervous system:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness.  These can be more pronounced with Ornidazole.
* **Changes in blood counts:**  Rare but possible.
* **Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):** Rare, but monitoring of liver function may be needed in patients with pre-existing liver disease.


**How it Works:**

* **Cefixime:**  This is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, leading to bacterial cell death.  It has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria.

* **Ornidazole:** This is a nitroimidazole antiprotozoal and antibacterial agent. It works by damaging the DNA of microorganisms, preventing their replication and causing cell death. It's effective against various anaerobic bacteria and some protozoa.

The combination allows for broader coverage against both bacteria and some parasites, making it effective against a wider range of infections than either drug alone.
