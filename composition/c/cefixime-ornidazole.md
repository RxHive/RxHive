# Cefixime + Ornidazole
### Generic Name
Cefixime + Ornidazole


### Usage

Cefixime + Ornidazole is a combination antibiotic used to treat various bacterial and parasitic infections.  It's particularly effective against infections affecting the gastrointestinal tract.  Cefixime, a third-generation cephalosporin, targets a wide range of bacteria, while Ornidazole, a nitroimidazole, is effective against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa.  

The primary use of this combination is in treating bacterial infections of the gut, often those complicated by anaerobic bacterial overgrowth.  This includes conditions like:

* **Infectious diarrhea:**  This combination is often prescribed for diarrhea caused by bacteria sensitive to cefixime and ornidazole.
* **Dysentery:**  It can help manage bacterial dysentery, characterized by bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps.
* **Other gastrointestinal infections:** The combination may be used for other infections of the digestive tract caused by susceptible organisms.


Secondary uses may be considered based on individual circumstances and physician judgment, though this combination is not typically a first-line treatment for systemic infections.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the patient's age, weight, the specific infection being treated, and the severity of the condition.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescription exactly.  There is no standard "over-the-counter" version of this combination drug available. It is always dispensed by prescription.

* **Oral Administration (Tablets or Capsules):**  The typical adult dose might involve one or two tablets twice daily.  Children's dosage is strictly weight-based and determined by a physician.  The oral form should be taken with food to minimize stomach upset.


* **Intravenous Administration (IV):**  This combination is not typically administered intravenously.  Cefixime and Ornidazole are often given separately via IV for severe systemic infections, but it's not common to find a pre-mixed IV formulation containing both.  The dosage and administration of IV Cefixime and Ornidazole would be individually determined and administered by a medical professional.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash
* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild to severe)


Less common but potentially serious side effects:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis):  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, difficulty breathing, or a rapid heartbeat.
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea:  This is a serious complication that can occur following antibiotic use.  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience persistent, watery diarrhea or bloody stools.
* Liver damage (rare):  Seek immediate medical attention if you develop symptoms of liver problems such as jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), dark urine, or unusual fatigue.

**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  Always report any unusual symptoms or side effects to your healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Cefixime and Ornidazole work through different mechanisms to target the infection.  Cefixime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, preventing bacteria from multiplying and ultimately leading to their death.  Ornidazole interferes with the DNA of anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, disrupting their ability to reproduce and survive.  This combined action effectively tackles both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms that might be contributing to the infection.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Do not take this medication if you are allergic to cephalosporins, nitroimidazoles, or any of its components.  Inform your doctor about any allergies you have.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This medication can interact with other drugs.  Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Consult your doctor before taking this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:**  Patients with liver or kidney problems may require dosage adjustments.  Your doctor should be aware of any pre-existing conditions.
* **Alcohol Consumption:**  Avoid alcohol consumption while taking Ornidazole, as it can cause a disulfiram-like reaction (severe nausea, vomiting, headache).
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Dizziness and drowsiness are possible side effects. Avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.
