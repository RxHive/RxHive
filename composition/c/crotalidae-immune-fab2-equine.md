# Crotalidae Immune F(ab')2 (Equine)
### Generic Name
Crotalidae Immune F(ab')2 (Equine)

### Usage
Crotalidae Immune F(ab')2 (equine) is an antivenom specifically designed to treat bites from North American rattlesnakes.  Its primary use is to neutralize the venom's effects, thereby preventing or mitigating serious complications. This includes addressing local effects at the bite site (such as swelling, pain, and tissue damage) and systemic effects (such as bleeding disorders, effects on the nervous system, and kidney damage).

### Dosage

**Rattlesnake Envenomation:**

* **Intravenous (IV) Administration:**  The recommended initial dose for both adults and children is 10 vials administered as quickly as possible after a rattlesnake bite, provided the patient shows signs of envenomation.  The dosage may be repeated every hour as needed until local signs of envenomation cease progressing, systemic symptoms resolve, and coagulation parameters normalize or show improvement. There's no established maximum dose; treatment is tailored to the individual case. Maintenance therapy may involve 4 vials as needed to manage re-emerging symptoms, especially coagulopathies.

* **Reconstitution:** Each vial should be reconstituted with 10 mL of sterile normal saline.  The resulting solution should be clear to yellow/green and slightly cloudy. Do not use if discolored or excessively cloudy.  The total dose (e.g., 10 vials) should be diluted in 250 mL of sterile normal saline for IV administration.

* **IV Infusion:** Administer intravenously over 60 minutes. Begin at a rate of 25-50 mL/hour for the first 10 minutes, closely monitoring for allergic reactions. If none occur, increase the rate to 250 mL/hour until complete. Stop the infusion immediately if an allergic reaction occurs and initiate appropriate emergency treatment.  Re-evaluate the risk-benefit ratio before resuming.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### How it Works

Crotalidae Immune F(ab')2 (equine) contains fragments of equine antibodies (F(ab')2) that are specifically designed to bind to and neutralize the toxins found in North American rattlesnake venom. By binding to these toxins, the antivenom prevents them from interacting with the body's tissues and cells, reducing the severity of envenomation symptoms. The neutralized toxins are then eliminated from the body.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** There is a risk of acute hypersensitivity reactions and delayed serum sickness.  Close monitoring for allergic reactions during administration is essential.
* **Drug Interactions:** Beta-blockers may prolong anaphylaxis and epinephrine may require higher doses than usual when used concomitantly.  Caution is advised.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Crotalidae Immune F(ab')2 (equine) is categorized as pregnancy category C.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  The excretion in breast milk is unknown, thus use caution in breastfeeding women.
