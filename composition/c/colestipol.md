# Colestipol
### Generic Name
Colestipol

### Usage
Colestipol is primarily used as an adjunct to diet in managing primary hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol).  This means it's used *in addition* to a cholesterol-lowering diet, not as a replacement for it.  It works by binding to bile acids in the intestines, preventing their reabsorption into the body.  Since the liver uses cholesterol to make bile acids, this process indirectly lowers cholesterol levels in the blood.  While its primary use is for hypercholesterolemia, colestipol has also been used off-label to treat pruritus (severe itching) associated with primary biliary cholangitis, a liver disease.  However, this off-label use should only be considered under the guidance of a physician.

### Dosage

**Adults:** Colestipol is available as granules and tablets.  Dosage is highly individualized and depends on the condition being treated and the patient's response.

* **Primary Hypercholesterolemia (Granules):**  Typically starts at 5 grams once or twice daily. The dose may be increased by 5 grams every 1-2 months, up to a maximum of 30 grams daily. For patients prone to constipation, starting with 5 grams daily for 5-7 days before increasing the dosage is recommended.
* **Primary Hypercholesterolemia (Tablets):** Usually begins at 2 grams once or twice daily.  The dose can be increased by 2 grams every 1-2 months, up to a maximum of 16 grams daily.
* **Pruritus with Primary Biliary Cholangitis (Granules - Off-label):**  Usually starts at 5 grams daily and may be increased as needed, up to 30 grams daily, under strict medical supervision.

**Children:**  Use in children is less common and should only be under the close supervision of a physician.  Dosage varies widely depending on age and weight, often ranging from 2 to 12 grams daily, or 125-250 mg/kg/day in some cases of familial hypercholesterolemia.  Always follow a physician's specific instructions.

**Important Administration Notes:**  Granules must be mixed thoroughly in at least 90ml of liquid before ingestion.  Tablets should be swallowed whole with plenty of water. Do not crush or chew tablets.  Other medications should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after colestipol to avoid drug interactions.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Constipation
* Abdominal pain or cramping
* Nausea
* Bloating
* Heartburn
* Indigestion
* Flatulence

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Hypoprothrombinemia (low levels of clotting factors) leading to increased bleeding risk.
* Hyperchloremic acidosis (an electrolyte imbalance) with chronic use.
* Vitamin deficiencies (fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid).
* Esophageal obstruction (if granules are not mixed properly).

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Colestipol is a bile acid sequestrant. It works by binding to bile acids in the digestive tract, preventing their reabsorption into the bloodstream. The liver then uses cholesterol to produce more bile acids, thus lowering the overall cholesterol level in the body.  This primarily reduces LDL ("bad") cholesterol.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Colestipol is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, complete biliary obstruction, and phenylketonuria (for granules only).
* **Drug Interactions:** Colestipol can interfere with the absorption of many other drugs, including fat-soluble vitamins, folic acid, digoxin, tetracycline, penicillin G, and several others.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.  Significant time gaps should be maintained between taking colestipol and other medications.
* **Specific Populations:** Use in pregnant or breastfeeding women requires careful monitoring due to potential vitamin deficiencies. Children should only be treated under strict medical supervision. Older adults may be at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency.
* **Other Precautions:**  Colestipol may worsen constipation.  Adequate hydration and fiber intake are crucial.  Regular monitoring of lipid profiles, as well as vitamin levels (especially vitamins A, D, E, K, and folate) may be necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take colestipol with other cholesterol-lowering medications?** A:  Yes, but it's crucial to consult your doctor.  Colestipol may interact with other medications, and the dosages need to be carefully adjusted.
* **Q: How should I store colestipol?** A: Store colestipol at room temperature in a dry place, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The effects of colestipol on cholesterol levels may take several weeks to become noticeable. Regular monitoring is essential.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Never double up on doses.
* **Q: Can I stop taking colestipol suddenly?** A: No, it's important to gradually reduce the dose under the guidance of your doctor before completely stopping colestipol to minimize any potential rebound effects.
