# Cenegermin
### Generic Name
Cenegermin

### Usage
Cenegermin is a medication used to treat neurotrophic keratitis.  This condition is characterized by damage to the cornea (the clear front part of the eye) due to nerve damage, leading to impaired corneal healing and potential vision loss. Cenegermin's primary role is to promote corneal healing and maintain corneal integrity by supporting the nerves in the eye's front section.  It is currently not indicated for the treatment of other eye conditions.

### Dosage
The recommended dosage of Cenegermin is for ophthalmic (eye) use.

**Adults and Children aged ≥2 years:**

* **Neurotrophic keratitis:**  One drop of 0.002% solution should be instilled into the affected eye(s) six times daily at two-hour intervals for eight weeks.


**Important Administration Guidelines:**

* Wash hands thoroughly before application.
* Pull down the lower eyelid and instill the drop into the conjunctival sac (the space between the eyelid and the eyeball).
* Blink several times to ensure even distribution across the eye's surface.
* Dispose of the single-use pipette immediately after use. If treating both eyes, use a separate pipette for each eye.
* Remove contact lenses before application and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.
* If using other topical eye medications, administer them at least 15 minutes apart.  Apply Cenegermin 15 minutes before any eye ointments, gels, or viscous eye drops.
* If a dose is missed, simply continue with the next scheduled dose.  Do not double the dose.


### Side Effects
The following are potential side effects of Cenegermin. This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects may occur.  If you experience any concerning symptoms, consult your doctor.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Eye pain


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Foreign body sensation in the eye
* Corneal deposits
* Lacrimation (increased tearing)
* Ocular hyperemia (redness of the eye)
* Ophthalmic inflammation


**Serious Side Effects (Less Common, but require immediate medical attention):**  While serious side effects are uncommon,  any significant worsening of eye symptoms or new, concerning symptoms warrant immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Cenegermin is a recombinant human nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF is a naturally occurring protein that plays a crucial role in the growth, maintenance, and survival of nerve cells (neurons).  In the context of neurotrophic keratitis, Cenegermin works by binding to specific receptors (TrkA and p75NTR) on the nerve cells in the cornea. This binding stimulates nerve cell growth, survival, and function, helping to restore corneal sensitivity and promote healing.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  Currently, no specific contraindications for Cenegermin are listed in the manufacturer’s labeling.

**Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known. However, always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Cenegermin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant should discuss the risks and benefits of using Cenegermin with their healthcare provider.

**Other Precautions:**  Patients should be advised to follow the administration instructions carefully.


### FAQs

A: The improvement in corneal health and vision varies from patient to patient. The standard treatment course is eight weeks, during which regular monitoring by an ophthalmologist is necessary to assess progress.

**Q: Can I use Cenegermin with other eye drops?**
A:  It's crucial to administer Cenegermin at least 15 minutes before or after other topical eye medications to avoid interactions or reduce the effectiveness of either medication.  Always consult your ophthalmologist or pharmacist if you are unsure about the compatibility of your medications.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Simply skip the missed dose and continue with the next scheduled dose.  Do not attempt to double the dose.

**Q: How should I store Cenegermin?**
