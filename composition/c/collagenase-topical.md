# Collagenase (Topical)
### Generic Name
Collagenase (Topical)

### Usage
Collagenase is a topical enzyme used primarily for debriding necrotic (dead) tissue from wounds.  This means it helps to clean and prepare the wound bed for healing. Its primary uses are in the treatment of dermal ulcers (skin sores) and burns.  The enzyme specifically targets collagen, a protein found in abundance in dead tissue, breaking it down and allowing it to be more easily removed. This facilitates wound healing by promoting the formation of healthy granulation tissue.

### Dosage
**Adults:** For debridement of dermal ulcers and burns, collagenase is applied topically once daily, or more frequently if the dressing becomes soiled.  The application method involves either directly applying the ointment to the wound or applying it to a sterile swab which is then placed over the wound. Daily wound cleaning with saline and gauze is usually recommended as part of the debridement process. Treatment should continue until necrotic tissue is removed and healthy granulation tissue is established.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of collagenase in children have not been established.  Therefore, it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, as systemic absorption after topical application is not considered significant.


### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Burning
* Irritation
* Pain at the application site
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)

Less common, but potentially more serious, side effects may occur, particularly with large area application or prolonged use.  Always consult a healthcare provider if any adverse effects occur.

### How it Works
Collagenase is a proteolytic enzyme derived from *Clostridium histolyticum*.  It selectively breaks down collagen found in necrotic tissue.  Importantly, it does not significantly affect healthy tissue or newly formed granulation tissue, making it a relatively targeted debriding agent. By removing the dead tissue, collagenase helps to create a clean wound bed that is more conducive to healing and the formation of healthy new tissue.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Collagenase is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity to collagenase.

**Interactions:**  The effectiveness of collagenase can be reduced if used concurrently with certain substances, including silver nitrate, povidone-iodine, urea, silver sulfadiazine, denaturants, detergents, certain heavy metal ions, and in environments of extreme pH (highly acidic or alkaline).

**Warnings:**  Use caution in debilitated patients to monitor for potential systemic bacterial infections.  Also, use caution when applying near healthy tissue, as transient erythema (redness) may occur.  Avoid the use of detergents, acidic solutions, or antiseptics containing heavy metals, as these can inactivate collagenase. The optimal pH for collagenase activity is 6-8.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of collagenase during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.

### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see results varies depending on the size and severity of the wound.  Consistent use is crucial.

**Q: Can I use collagenase on all types of wounds?** A: No, it's specifically indicated for wounds with necrotic tissue, such as dermal ulcers and burns.  It is not suitable for all types of wounds.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop using the medication and consult your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent.

**Q: How should I store collagenase?** A: Store according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and extreme temperatures.
