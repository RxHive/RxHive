# Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine + Paracetamol + Sodium Citrate

**Generic Name:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine + Paracetamol + Sodium Citrate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, or other upper respiratory allergies.  The specific components target different symptoms:

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that helps reduce runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that helps relieve stuffiness in the nose and sinuses.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) that helps reduce fever and aches and pains associated with colds and flu.
* **Sodium Citrate:** Acts as a buffer, helping to maintain the stability of the formulation and may contribute to a more pleasant taste.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage. Common side effects may include:

* **Drowsiness:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate is a sedating antihistamine.
* **Dry mouth:** A common side effect of both antihistamines and decongestants.
* **Headache:** Can be a side effect of the medication or a symptom it's intended to treat.
* **Nausea:** Less common, but possible.
* **Dizziness:** Particularly with phenylephrine.
* **Insomnia:**  Particularly if taken later in the day.
* **Increased blood pressure:**  Phenylephrine can raise blood pressure.
* **Constipation:** Less common.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, or swelling are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.

**How it Works:**

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This reduces symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.
* **Phenylephrine:** Acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood vessels of the nasal passages, causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels). This reduces swelling and congestion in the nose and sinuses.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates body temperature.  It also reduces pain by affecting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to pain and inflammation.
* **Sodium Citrate:** As mentioned before, it helps stabilize the formulation and improve palatability.
