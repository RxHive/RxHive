# Casirivimab + Imdevimab
### Generic Name
Casirivimab + Imdevimab

### Usage
Casirivimab and Imdevimab is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies.  It's primarily used for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results from a SARS-CoV-2 viral test, who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization.  This high-risk group includes individuals with certain underlying medical conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, chronic lung disease, or compromised immune systems.  The treatment aims to reduce the viral load and prevent severe illness, hospitalization, and death.  It's crucial to understand that this is not a preventative measure or a substitute for vaccination.  It's used *after* a COVID-19 diagnosis and only under the direction of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage
Dosage is administered through intravenous (IV) infusion.  The recommended dose is a single infusion containing 1200 mg of casirivimab and 1200 mg of imdevimab.  Specific dosage adjustments based on age, weight, or disease severity are not typically made, as the combination is specifically formulated for a single administration in the approved patient population.  There are no oral formulations of this combination therapy currently available.  The infusion should be administered by a healthcare professional in a clinical setting.


### Side Effects
Common side effects reported include:

*   Nausea
*   Headache
*   Fatigue
*   Muscle pain
*   Chills
*   Fever
*   Injection site reactions (redness, swelling, pain)

Less common, but more serious side effects include allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.  Report any unusual or concerning symptoms to your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Casirivimab and Imdevimab are monoclonal antibodies, meaning they are laboratory-made proteins designed to mimic the body's natural immune response.  These antibodies specifically target the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, preventing it from binding to and entering human cells.  By neutralizing the virus, this combination reduces its ability to replicate and spread, thus lessening the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and minimizing the risk of hospitalization.  The exact mechanism of action is complex but involves both direct viral neutralization and modulation of the host immune response.


### Precautions
