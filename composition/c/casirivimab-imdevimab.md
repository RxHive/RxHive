# Casirivimab + Imdevimab

**Generic Name:** Casirivimab and Imdevimab

**Usage:**  Casirivimab and Imdevimab is a monoclonal antibody therapy used for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results from a viral test who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization.  It is *not* a preventative treatment or a replacement for vaccination.  Its use should be guided by current guidelines from health authorities as the authorization may vary by country and the evolving understanding of the virus and its variants.  The effectiveness is impacted by the circulating variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects may include:

* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Chills
* Fever

More serious, but less common, side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild to severe, including anaphylaxis)
* Infusion-related reactions
* Worsening of existing kidney problems

**How it Works:** Casirivimab and Imdevimab are monoclonal antibodies that target the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  By binding to specific sites on the spike protein, they prevent the virus from entering human cells and thus inhibit viral replication, helping to reduce the severity and duration of the illness.  They work by different mechanisms but act synergistically.

**FAQs:**

* **Is it a vaccine?** No, it is a treatment for existing COVID-19 infection, not a vaccine to prevent it.
* **How is it administered?** It's administered as a single intravenous infusion.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The effects are not immediate.  It takes time for the antibodies to bind to the virus and neutralize it.
* **How effective is it against all variants?**  Effectiveness varies depending on the specific SARS-CoV-2 variant circulating.  Its efficacy against newer variants has diminished over time, leading to limited use in many regions.  This is why it is crucial to check current health authority guidelines.
* **Are there any drug interactions?**  Potential drug interactions should be discussed with a healthcare professional.
* **Who should not receive it?**  Individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction to Casirivimab and Imdevimab, or any of its components, should not receive it.  Those with certain kidney conditions may also be ineligible.
