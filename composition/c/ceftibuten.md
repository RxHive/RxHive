# Ceftibuten
### Generic Name
Ceftibuten

### Usage
Ceftibuten is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections.  Its primary use is in treating infections caused by susceptible bacteria.  Specifically, it's effective against infections such as:

* **Acute otitis media (middle ear infection):**  A common infection in children, characterized by ear pain and inflammation.
* **Tonsillitis and pharyngitis (strep throat):** Infections of the tonsils and throat, often caused by Streptococcus bacteria.
* **Pneumonia:**  Infection of the lungs that can cause cough, fever, and shortness of breath.
* **Cystitis (bladder infection):**  Infection of the bladder, characterized by frequent and painful urination.
* **Sinusitis:**  Inflammation of the sinuses, typically causing facial pain and congestion.
* **Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis:** A worsening of chronic bronchitis symptoms due to a bacterial infection.

It's important to note that Ceftibuten is only effective against bacterial infections; it will not treat viral infections like the common cold or flu.  A doctor will determine if Ceftibuten is the appropriate treatment based on the specific infection and its cause.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  The dosage varies depending on the infection being treated. Generally, the standard adult dose is 400 mg once daily (OD) for 10 days for many infections (otitis media, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis).  For pneumonia, a dosage of 200 mg twice daily (BID) for 1-2 weeks might be prescribed. Cystitis treatment may involve 400 mg OD for a week, while sinusitis could require 400 mg OD for 10-14 days.  A doctor will determine the precise dosage and duration based on individual needs.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Ceftibuten's safety and effectiveness haven't been established for infants under 6 months old. For children aged 6 months to 12 years, the typical dose is 9 mg/kg once daily for 10 days, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. Children 12 years and older receive the adult dosage.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with kidney problems (renal impairment).  The specific adjustments depend on the creatinine clearance (CrCl) rate, a measure of kidney function. A doctor will carefully calculate the appropriate dosage based on individual kidney function.  No dosage adjustments are typically recommended for individuals with liver problems (hepatic impairment).


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Abdominal pain
* Vomiting
* Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils, a type of white blood cell)
* Changes in hemoglobin or platelet counts
* Elevated liver enzyme levels (ALT, bilirubin)
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but can be serious and require immediate medical attention.  They include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Pseudomembranous colitis (a severe bowel infection)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a serious skin reaction)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (a life-threatening skin reaction)
*  Other less common side effects include: agitation, anorexia, aphasia, candidiasis, constipation, dehydration, diaper rash, drowsiness, dysgeusia (altered taste), dyspnea (shortness of breath), dysuria (painful urination), eructation (belching), fatigue, fever, flatulence, hematuria (blood in urine), hyperkinesia (excessive movement), increased levels of ALP and AST (liver enzymes), creatinine, insomnia, irritability, jaundice, leukopenia (low white blood cell count), melena (dark, tarry stools), nasal congestion, paresthesia (numbness or tingling), pruritus (itching), psychosis, rigors (shivering), serum sickness, skin rash, stridor (high-pitched breathing sound), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), urticaria (hives), vaginitis, and xerostomia (dry mouth).

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Ceftibuten is a beta-lactam antibiotic that works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. Specifically, it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in bacteria, inhibiting the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis.  This prevents the bacteria from building and maintaining their cell walls, leading to cell lysis (breakdown) and ultimately bacterial death.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ceftibuten is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to ceftibuten, other cephalosporins, or any component of the medication.
* **Allergies:** Exercise caution in patients with a history of penicillin allergy, as cross-reactivity can occur.
* **Gastrointestinal Issues:** Use with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal diseases, particularly colitis.
* **Kidney Problems:** Dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with impaired kidney function.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ceftibuten can interact with several other medications, including aminoglycosides (increasing nephrotoxicity), probenecid (increasing Ceftibuten levels), and vitamin K antagonists (enhancing anticoagulant effects).  Consult a doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ceftibuten is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning animal studies have shown no risk, but human studies are lacking.  The excretion of Ceftibuten into breast milk is unknown, and it should be used cautiously during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Ceftibuten with food?** A: For capsules, it can be taken without regard to food.  For the oral suspension, it is best taken 2 hours before or 1 hour after meals.

* **Q: How should I store Ceftibuten?** A: Store Ceftibuten at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any bothersome or unusual side effects.

* **Q: Is Ceftibuten effective against viral infections?** A: No, Ceftibuten is only effective against bacterial infections.  It won't work for viral infections like the common cold or flu.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Ceftibuten once I feel better?** A: No, complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better.  Stopping early may lead to treatment failure and the development of antibiotic resistance.
