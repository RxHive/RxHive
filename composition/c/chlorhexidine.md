# Chlorhexidine
### Generic Name
Chlorhexidine

### Usage
Chlorhexidine is a topical antiseptic used to disinfect skin, mucous membranes, and wounds.  Its primary use is for surgical hand disinfection and prepping skin before procedures to reduce the risk of infection. It's also commonly used to clean and disinfect wounds, prevent oral infections (such as gingivitis), and treat some skin conditions.  While it's effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria, fungi, and some viruses, it's not effective against all microorganisms.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific product, the area being treated, and the condition being addressed.  Always follow the instructions provided with the specific Chlorhexidine product.

**Examples:**

* **Skin Antisepsis (Solutions):**  Solutions come in various concentrations (0.02%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.5%).  Application typically involves cleaning the area with water, applying a small amount of the solution, and allowing it to dry for several minutes.  The exact amount and frequency will depend on the specific product and the situation.

* **Wound Cleansing:** Again, concentration and application method will vary based on the wound type and product instructions. Generally, a solution is applied directly to the affected area, ensuring it's thoroughly cleaned.

* **Oral Antisepsis (Mouthwashes):** Mouthwashes usually contain a lower concentration of chlorhexidine (typically 0.12%).  Instructions usually involve rinsing the mouth for a specific duration (e.g., 30 seconds) and then spitting out the solution.  Never swallow the mouthwash.

* **Powder (1%):**  Applied lightly to affected areas as needed.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Use in children and infants should be approached cautiously, particularly with solutions.  Always consult a pediatrician before using chlorhexidine on children, especially newborns and premature infants, due to potential skin reactions.  The dosage is generally the same as for adults, but the application area may be smaller.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site. These can include:

* Skin irritation
* Burning sensation
* Dryness
* Staining of teeth (with oral solutions)
* Alteration in taste
* Allergic reactions (rare but possible)

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention)

If any side effects, especially serious ones, occur, discontinue use and contact a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Chlorhexidine is a cationic antiseptic, meaning it carries a positive charge.  Bacteria have a negatively charged cell wall.  This positive charge allows chlorhexidine to bind to the bacterial cell wall, disrupting its integrity and causing leakage of essential components. At higher concentrations, it can also denature bacterial proteins, leading to bacterial cell death.  This dual mechanism (bacteriostatic at lower concentrations, bactericidal at higher concentrations) makes it effective against a broad range of microorganisms.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Chlorhexidine should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to chlorhexidine or any of its components.
* **Premature and Neonates:** Use in premature infants and neonates should be approached cautiously and under the supervision of a healthcare professional due to increased risk of skin irritation.
* **Oral Use:** Avoid swallowing chlorhexidine mouthwash.  Prolonged use of oral chlorhexidine may lead to staining of the teeth and alteration of taste.  Regular dental check-ups are recommended for those using oral chlorhexidine solutions regularly.
* **Application:** Avoid applying to large areas of the skin, the face, head, or near the meninges (brain and spinal cord).  Do not apply to open wounds, eyes, or ears.
* **Drug Interactions:**  No significant interactions with other medications are typically reported. However, it's always best to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While considered safe for topical use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, always consult with a healthcare professional before using it.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use chlorhexidine on a deep wound?** A:  No, it's best to consult a doctor for deep wounds.  Chlorhexidine is appropriate for cleaning superficial wounds, but deeper wounds require professional medical assessment and treatment.

* **Q: How should I store chlorhexidine?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effectiveness of chlorhexidine is immediate, but it's vital to follow application instructions correctly for optimal results.

* **Q:  What if I accidentally swallow some chlorhexidine mouthwash?** A:  Contact your doctor or poison control center immediately. Although generally considered low toxicity, ingestion can still have adverse effects.

* **Q: Can I use chlorhexidine for all infections?** A: No, chlorhexidine is effective against a range of bacteria, fungi, and some viruses, but it's not a cure-all for all infections.  Consult a doctor for appropriate treatment for any infection.
