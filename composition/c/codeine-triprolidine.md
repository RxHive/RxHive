# Codeine + Triprolidine

**Generic Name:** Codeine/Triprolidine

**Usage:**  Codeine/Triprolidine is a combination medication used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, flu, or other allergies.  Codeine is an opioid cough suppressant that reduces the urge to cough. Triprolidine is an antihistamine that reduces runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.  This combination is typically used for short-term relief of mild to moderate symptoms.  It's important to note that this combination is **generally not recommended for children** due to the risks associated with codeine.  Always follow a doctor's or pharmacist's instructions.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect, especially with the combination of codeine and triprolidine.  Avoid driving or operating machinery.
* **Dry mouth:** Drink plenty of fluids to help alleviate this.
* **Constipation:** Increase fiber intake and fluid consumption. Consider a stool softener if necessary.
* **Dizziness:**  Avoid sudden changes in position.
* **Nausea:**  This is less common but can occur.
* **Blurred vision:** Avoid tasks requiring sharp vision.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or other signs of an allergic reaction.
* **Severe constipation:** This can lead to serious complications.
* **Slowed breathing:** Especially a concern at higher doses.
* **Confusion or mental changes:** This is more likely in older adults.


**How it Works:**

* **Codeine:**  Binds to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, suppressing the cough reflex.  It also has mild pain-relieving properties.
* **Triprolidine:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This reduces symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes.
