# Calamine

**Generic Name:** Calamine

**Usage:** Calamine lotion is a topical medication used to relieve the itching and irritation associated with:

* Mild rashes
* Insect bites
* Poison ivy/oak/sumac
* Chicken pox
* Sunburn
* Other minor skin irritations

**Side Effects:** Calamine lotion is generally well-tolerated, but some individuals may experience:

* Mild skin irritation or redness at the application site. This is usually temporary and resolves quickly.
* Allergic reactions are rare but possible. Symptoms might include swelling, hives, or difficulty breathing.  If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue use and seek medical attention immediately.


**How it Works:** Calamine lotion contains zinc oxide and ferric oxide.  Zinc oxide is an astringent that helps to dry up weeping or oozing skin and forms a protective barrier, reducing irritation. Ferric oxide provides a slight anesthetic effect and may help to soothe the skin. The combination provides both a drying and soothing action.
