# Calamine
### Generic Name
Calamine

### Usage
Calamine is a topical medication primarily used to soothe and protect the skin from minor irritations.  Its main applications include relieving the itching, pain, and discomfort associated with:

*   Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac exposure.
*   Sunburns.
*   Insect bites and stings.

While not its primary purpose, calamine can also provide a degree of protection to the affected skin area, helping to prevent further irritation or infection.

### Dosage
Dosage for calamine lotion or cream varies depending on the formulation (percentage of calamine), but generally involves applying a thin layer to the affected area 1 to 4 times daily.  Specific instructions will be on the product packaging.

*   **Adults:**  The typical application is 1-4 times daily for up to 7 days.  Do not exceed 7 days of use unless directed by a doctor.
*   **Children (including infants aged 6 months and older):** The same dosage as adults can generally be used, but always consult a pediatrician before applying any medication to a child's skin.

Calamine is typically available as a lotion or cream. It is for external use only; avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild.  However,  it is important to discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider if any side effects occur.

*   Skin irritation (redness, rash)
*   Allergic reactions (in rare cases)


### How it Works
The precise mechanism of how calamine works isn't fully understood.  However, it's known to have both astringent (mildly drying) and skin-protective properties.  The astringent action helps to dry out weeping or oozing skin lesions, which can reduce itching. The protective aspect acts as a barrier, shielding the irritated skin from further environmental irritants.

*   **Neonates:** Use with caution in newborns (less than one month old).

*   **Duration of Use:** Do not use for more than 7 days without consulting a doctor.  If symptoms worsen or do not improve, seek medical advice.
