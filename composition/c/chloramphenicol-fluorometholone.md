# Chloramphenicol + Fluorometholone
### Generic Name
Chloramphenicol + Fluorometholone

**Note:**  Chloramphenicol and fluorometholone are typically combined in ophthalmic (eye) preparations.  This information pertains to that specific combination and does not apply to the individual drugs used in other contexts.  Always refer to the specific product labeling for complete information.

### Usage

Chloramphenicol and fluorometholone ophthalmic combination is primarily used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and other bacterial infections of the eye that are also accompanied by inflammation. Chloramphenicol, an antibiotic, targets the bacteria causing the infection, while fluorometholone, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation and swelling.  This dual action helps to alleviate symptoms like redness, itching, and discharge more effectively than using either drug alone.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is specifically for bacterial infections; it will not work against viral or fungal eye infections.

### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary significantly depending on the specific brand and formulation of the chloramphenicol and fluorometholone ophthalmic combination.  **Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist and the product labeling.**  Generally, the prescribed dosage involves instilling one or two drops into the affected eye(s) several times a day.  The exact frequency and duration of treatment will depend on the severity of the infection and individual response to treatment.

**Children and Adults:**  Dosage is typically the same for both adults and children. However, children may require adult supervision during administration.

**Oral and IV Administration:** This medication is only for topical (eye) use.  It is not meant to be taken orally or administered intravenously.

### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Burning or stinging sensation upon application, temporary blurred vision, mild eye irritation.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Increased eye pressure (glaucoma), development of cataracts, thinning of the cornea, eye infections (fungal or viral), allergic reactions (rash, swelling, itching).  
* **Important Note:** If you experience any unusual symptoms or the infection doesn't improve within a few days, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, effectively stopping the growth and reproduction of bacteria causing the eye infection. Fluorometholone is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation by suppressing the body's inflammatory response.  The combined action of these two medications provides both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, leading to faster healing and symptom relief.
