# Chloramphenicol + Fluorometholone

**Generic Name:** Chloramphenicol + Fluorometholone (Various brand names exist,  always check your specific medication's labeling)

**Usage:**  This combination medication is an ophthalmic (eye) preparation used to treat bacterial infections of the eye accompanied by inflammation.  It's typically prescribed for conditions like conjunctivitis (pink eye) or other eye infections where both an antibiotic (chloramphenicol) and a steroid (fluorometholone) are needed.  **Important:** This medication is only for use in the eye and should never be taken orally.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and duration of treatment.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects may include:

* **Burning, stinging, or itching:** These are often temporary and mild.
* **Eye irritation:**  Redness, dryness, or discomfort.
* **Blurred vision:** Usually temporary.
* **Increased intraocular pressure (IOP):**  This is a serious side effect, especially with prolonged use, and can lead to glaucoma. Regular IOP monitoring may be necessary.
* **Delayed wound healing:** The steroid component can impair the healing process.
* **Increased risk of secondary infection:** Suppression of the immune response by the steroid can increase the risk of fungal or viral infections.
* **Cataract formation:** Long-term use can increase the risk of cataracts.
* **Thinning of the cornea:** This can weaken the cornea.


**Less common but more serious side effects:**  These require immediate medical attention.

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Vision changes
* Severe eye pain


**How it Works:**

* **Chloramphenicol:** This is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, effectively stopping bacterial growth and killing the bacteria causing the infection.

* **Fluorometholone:** This is a corticosteroid (steroid) that reduces inflammation and swelling in the eye. It works by suppressing the immune response in the affected area, thus reducing the symptoms of inflammation.  The combination of the antibiotic and the steroid provides both infection control and symptom relief.
