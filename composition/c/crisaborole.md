# Crisaborole
### Generic Name
Crisaborole

### Usage
Crisaborole is a topical medication primarily used to treat mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults and children aged 3 months and older.  Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by itchy, inflamed skin.  Crisaborole helps to reduce the inflammation and itching associated with this condition.  It's currently not indicated for other skin conditions.

### Dosage
Crisaborole is available as a 2% ointment.  The recommended dosage for both adults and children (3 months and older) is a thin film applied to the affected area twice daily (BID). The amount used will depend on the size of the affected area.  There are no specific dosage adjustments based on weight or renal/hepatic impairment outlined in current prescribing information.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include application site pain. Less common side effects (<1%) may include urticaria (hives).  Serious, but less frequent, side effects include hypersensitivity reactions (such as allergic contact dermatitis).  If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as less common or serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Crisaborole is a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor.  PDE4 is an enzyme involved in the inflammatory response. By inhibiting PDE4, crisaborole increases levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) within cells.  Increased cAMP helps to reduce inflammation and itching, thereby alleviating the symptoms of atopic dermatitis.

### Precautions
Crisaborole is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to crisaborole or any component of the formulation.  There's an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including contact urticaria, severe pruritus (itching), swelling, or erythema (redness).  Use with caution in neonates (newborn infants).  While the risk during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown, the decision to use crisaborole during these periods should carefully weigh the benefits against potential risks to the infant and mother. The medication is for topical use only; avoid contact with eyes, mouth, or vagina.  It's advisable to wash hands before and after application.
