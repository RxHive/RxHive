# Crisaborole

**Generic Name:** Crisaborole

**Usage:**

Crisaborole is a topical (applied to the skin) medication used to treat mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (eczema) in people aged 2 years and older.  It's specifically designed to reduce the itching and inflammation associated with eczema.  It's applied directly to the affected skin areas as directed by a doctor.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of crisaborole are generally mild and can include:

* Burning sensation at the application site
* Application site pain
* Application site pruritus (itching)
* Erythema (redness) at the application site
* Skin dryness at the application site

Less common side effects may include:

* Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles)
* Skin infections
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)


Serious side effects are rare but should be reported to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

Crisaborole is a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor.  PDE4 is an enzyme involved in the inflammatory response of the skin. By inhibiting PDE4, crisaborole helps reduce the inflammation and itching associated with atopic dermatitis. It works differently than corticosteroids, another common eczema treatment.
