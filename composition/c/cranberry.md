# Cranberry
### Generic Name
Cranberry

### Usage
Cranberry is primarily used for the *prevention* of urinary tract infections (UTIs), not their treatment.  It's believed to work by preventing bacteria, particularly *E. coli*, from adhering to the walls of the urinary tract.  While some studies suggest a potential role in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, the evidence supporting this use is currently limited and requires further research.  It's crucial to understand that cranberry is a preventative measure and should not replace antibiotics or other prescribed treatments for UTIs.

### Dosage
There isn't a standardized dosage for cranberry.  The amount used in clinical trials varies considerably, and the effectiveness depends on factors like the concentration of active compounds (proanthocyanidins) in the product.  Dosage information is typically found on the product packaging and should be followed carefully.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance, particularly if you have pre-existing health conditions.  For children, there are no established safe and effective dosage guidelines; pediatric use should be discussed with a doctor.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Upset stomach
* Diarrhea
* Heartburn

Serious side effects are rare. However, it's important to note that individuals with a history of kidney stones or those prone to kidney stones should exercise caution as cranberry may increase the risk of stone formation.

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider for advice.

### How it Works
Cranberries contain various compounds, notably proanthocyanidins (PACs), that are believed to be responsible for their UTI-preventative effects.  PACs interfere with the ability of bacteria, such as *E. coli*, to adhere to the cells lining the urinary tract. This prevents the bacteria from colonizing and establishing an infection.  It's important to note that cranberry does not alter urine pH significantly, unlike some other UTI prevention strategies.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Cranberry is contraindicated in individuals with known allergies to cranberry products and those with a history of kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) or a predisposition to developing them.
* **Drug Interactions:** While generally considered safe, potential interactions with certain medications are possible. Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications, especially those affecting kidney function.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Consuming cranberry in amounts typical of normal dietary intake is generally considered safe during pregnancy. However, the safety of cranberry during breastfeeding is not fully established.
* **Other Considerations:**  People with certain medical conditions should consult their doctor before using cranberry products.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can cranberry treat a UTI?**  A: No, cranberry is used to *prevent* UTIs, not treat existing ones.  If you have a UTI, seek medical attention for appropriate treatment with antibiotics.

* **Q: Can I use cranberry juice instead of supplements?** A: Cranberry juice can contribute to cranberry intake, but the concentration of active compounds may vary significantly between brands and types of juice.  Supplements often provide a more standardized dose of the active components.

* **Q: How should I store cranberry supplements?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the product packaging.  This usually involves storing in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
