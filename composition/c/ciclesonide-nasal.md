# Ciclesonide (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Ciclesonide (Nasal)

### Usage
Ciclesonide nasal spray is primarily used to treat the nasal symptoms associated with both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  This means it helps relieve symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, and nasal congestion caused by allergies.  While its primary use is for allergic rhinitis, it may sometimes be considered for other inflammatory conditions of the nose, but this should always be under the direct guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Ciclesonide nasal spray comes in different formulations (suspension and aerosol solution) with varying strengths per spray.  Dosage will depend on the specific formulation prescribed by your doctor and your age. **Product formulations are not interchangeable.**  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

**Adults (Allergic Rhinitis):**

* **Intranasal Suspension (50 mcg/spray):** Typically 2 sprays per nostril once daily. The maximum daily dose is 200 mcg.
* **Intranasal Aerosol Solution (37 mcg/spray):** Typically 1 spray per nostril once daily. The maximum daily dose is 74 mcg.


**Children (Allergic Rhinitis):**

Dosage for children varies significantly depending on age, the specific formulation, and the type of allergic rhinitis (seasonal or perennial).  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  Generally:

* **Perennial Allergic Rhinitis:** Children aged 2-11 years may receive 1-2 sprays per nostril once daily (using the suspension formulation), with a maximum of 200 mcg per day. Children 12 years and older may receive similar dosing to adults.  Aerosol solution use in this age group is also possible according to the prescribed instructions.
* **Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis:**  Children aged 6 years and older may receive a dosage similar to adults, again based on the specific product formulation and doctor's instructions.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Epistaxis (nosebleeds)
* Headache
* Nausea


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
*  Nasal ulceration or perforation (hole in the nasal septum)
*  Thrush (oral or nasal yeast infection)
*  Adrenal suppression (suppression of the body's natural cortisol production) â€“ more likely with long-term or high-dose use.
*  Delayed wound healing.


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works

Ciclesonide is a pro-drug, meaning it's converted into its active form (des-ciclesonide) in the body after administration.  Des-ciclesonide is a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids work by reducing inflammation in the nasal passages. They decrease the production of substances that cause allergic reactions and inflammation, thus providing relief from symptoms. The exact mechanisms are complex and involve interactions with various immune cells and inflammatory mediators.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Ciclesonide is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to ciclesonide or any component of the formulation.
* **Infections:**  Avoid use in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis of the respiratory tract, or untreated fungal, bacterial, or viral infections.
* **Immunosuppression:**  Ciclesonide may suppress the immune system, increasing the risk of infections.
* **Ocular Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with glaucoma, cataracts, or a history of increased intraocular pressure.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Ciclesonide is categorized as pregnancy category C. While generally considered safe in usual intranasal doses, other allergy medications might be preferred during pregnancy.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use caution if breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concurrent use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (like ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, or nelfinavir) may increase the risk of systemic side effects and should be avoided.
* **Pediatric Use:**  Monitor growth in children and adolescents receiving long-term treatment.
* **Long-term use:**  Prolonged use may increase the risk of adrenal suppression and other side effects. Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is crucial.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The onset of relief may vary but is usually seen within a few days of starting treatment.
* **Q: How long should I use it?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the severity and type of allergy and should be determined by your doctor.
* **Q: Can I stop suddenly?** A:  It's generally recommended to gradually reduce the dosage under your doctor's supervision rather than stopping abruptly, especially after prolonged use.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature away from heat and moisture.
* **Q:  Can I use it while pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: Discuss with your doctor; while generally considered safe in usual intranasal doses during pregnancy, other allergy medications might be preferred. Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
