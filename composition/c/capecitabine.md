# Capecitabine
### Generic Name
Capecitabine

### Usage

Capecitabine is a type of chemotherapy medication used to treat several types of cancer.  Its primary use is in treating metastatic breast cancer. This means breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. It's often used when other treatments, such as paclitaxel and anthracyclines, haven't been successful.  Capecitabine is sometimes used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, such as docetaxel, to improve effectiveness.

Beyond breast cancer, capecitabine also plays a role in treating metastatic colorectal cancer (colon cancer that has spread). It can be used as a first-line treatment in some cases or after other treatments have failed.  Additionally, it's employed as adjuvant therapy for Dukes C colon cancer (a more advanced stage of colon cancer) after surgery to help prevent recurrence.  While not its primary indication, capecitabine is also used off-label in various other cancers, including anal carcinoma, biliary tract cancer, esophageal and gastric cancers, head and neck squamous cell cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer.  The specific use and dosage in these off-label applications will vary considerably and depend on the individual case and physician's judgment. Always consult with an oncologist for guidance on using capecitabine for conditions outside its primary indications.


### Dosage

Capecitabine dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the type of cancer being treated, the patient's overall health, body surface area (BSA), and response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow a physician's specific instructions carefully. The medication comes in tablet form and is administered orally.

**Common Dosages (Examples – Always follow physician's prescription):**

* **Metastatic Breast Cancer:**  Typically 1250 mg/m² twice daily (BID) for two weeks, followed by a one-week rest period. This cycle is repeated.  Dosage may be adjusted based on individual tolerance and response.  In some cases, lower doses may be initiated or used in combination therapy.

* **Metastatic Colorectal Cancer:**  A common regimen is 1250 mg/m² BID for two weeks out of a three-week cycle.  However, for certain populations, a starting dose of 1000 mg/m² BID may be considered.

* **Adjuvant Dukes C Colon Cancer:** Typically 1250 mg/m² BID for two weeks out of a three-week cycle for a total of 24 weeks (8 cycles).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage may need to be adjusted based on kidney or liver function, age, and side effects. Older adults (over 65) might receive lower initial doses.  Individuals with kidney or liver problems will likely require dose adjustments or may not be able to take this medication.  Obese patients may require adjustments based on actual body weight or BSA calculations, usually following American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines.

**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and effectiveness of capecitabine in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

Capecitabine, like other chemotherapy drugs, can cause various side effects.  The severity and frequency of side effects vary from person to person.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Hand-foot syndrome (pain, redness, swelling, and/or blistering of the palms and soles)
* Mouth sores (stomatitis)
* Loss of appetite
* Anemia
* Changes in blood counts (neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Skin rash
* Edema (swelling)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe diarrhea or dehydration
* Severe mouth sores
* Severe hand-foot syndrome
* Severe anemia
* Severe neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Cardiotoxicity (heart problems)
* Liver problems (hepatotoxicity)
* Neurological problems (peripheral neuropathy, etc.)

**If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Capecitabine is a prodrug, meaning it's inactive until it's metabolized in the body.  It's converted to fluorouracil (5-FU), an antimetabolite. Fluorouracil interferes with the creation of DNA and RNA, essential components for cell growth and replication. By disrupting these processes, fluorouracil effectively slows or stops the growth of cancer cells.  Because rapidly dividing cancer cells are more vulnerable to this disruption, capecitabine is effective in treating cancers.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Capecitabine is contraindicated in patients with severe kidney problems (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), severe hypersensitivity to capecitabine or fluorouracil, or complete absence of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity.  It should not be used with sorivudine or similar medications.

* **Drug Interactions:** Capecitabine can interact with many other drugs, particularly other chemotherapy agents, anticoagulants (like warfarin), and antacids.  It's crucial to inform your physician of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Capecitabine is a pregnancy category D drug; it can cause harm to a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least six months after the last dose. Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for two weeks after the final dose.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults may require dose reductions due to decreased kidney or liver function.

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment.  Severe impairment may contraindicate its use.

* **Hand-Foot Syndrome:**  Hand-foot syndrome is a common side effect that can be managed with supportive care.

* **Monitoring:** Regular blood tests to monitor blood counts, liver function, and kidney function are essential during capecitabine therapy.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I be on capecitabine?** A:  The duration of treatment varies depending on the type of cancer, stage, and response to treatment. Your oncologist will determine the appropriate treatment duration.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking capecitabine?** A:  It's generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking capecitabine because it can worsen side effects, particularly nausea and vomiting.  Discuss this with your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your oncologist or pharmacist for guidance; don't double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store capecitabine?** A: Store capecitabine tablets at room temperature away from moisture and light.
