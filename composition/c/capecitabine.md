# Capecitabine

**Generic Name:** Capecitabine

**Usage:** Capecitabine is an oral chemotherapy medication used to treat several types of cancer, including:

* **Breast cancer:** Often used as adjuvant therapy (after surgery) or in combination with other treatments for metastatic breast cancer.
* **Colorectal cancer:** Used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs or as a single agent for metastatic colorectal cancer or adjuvant therapy.
* **Stomach cancer:**  May be used in combination with other treatments.
* **Other cancers:**  It's sometimes used off-label for other solid tumors.


The specific use and dosage will be determined by a physician based on the type and stage of cancer, the patient's overall health, and other factors.

**Side Effects:** Capecitabine can cause a wide range of side effects, varying in severity from mild to life-threatening.  Some common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea (often severe), nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, mouth sores (stomatitis), loss of appetite.
* **Hand-Foot Syndrome (Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia):** Redness, swelling, pain, and tingling in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
* **Fatigue:**  Extreme tiredness.
* **Blood problems:** Low red blood cell count (anemia), low white blood cell count (neutropenia), low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), increasing risk of infection and bleeding.
* **Skin reactions:** Rash, dryness, sunburn-like reaction.
* **Neurological effects:** Numbness, tingling, pain in the extremities.
* **Other:**  Hair thinning or loss (alopecia), changes in taste, dehydration.


Serious side effects, though less common, can include:  severe infections, bleeding, heart problems, kidney problems, and severe allergic reactions.  **Patients should immediately report any severe or concerning side effects to their doctor.**


**How it Works:** Capecitabine is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into an active anti-cancer drug (5-fluorouracil or 5-FU) inside the cancer cells.  5-FU interferes with the creation of DNA and RNA, essential for cell growth and replication.  By disrupting these processes, capecitabine inhibits the growth and spread of cancer cells.  The conversion to 5-FU primarily occurs in tumor cells, which helps to minimize side effects in healthy cells, though systemic effects are still possible.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is capecitabine administered?** A: Capecitabine is taken orally (by mouth) as tablets.
* **Q: How long is the treatment course?** A: The duration of treatment varies greatly depending on the type and stage of cancer and the patient's response to the medication. It can range from several weeks to several months.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Never double a dose. Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice on what to do if you miss a dose.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking capecitabine?** A:  Alcohol can worsen some side effects, especially nausea and gastrointestinal issues.  It's best to avoid alcohol or limit consumption significantly while on this medication.  Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.
* **Q: Are there any precautions I should take while on capecitabine?** A:  Yes. You should inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as some may interact with capecitabine.  You should also be aware of the risk of sun sensitivity and take precautions to protect your skin from sunlight. Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor blood cell counts.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of capecitabine?** A: Long-term effects can vary and are dependent on the dosage and duration of treatment. Some possible long-term effects may include peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage), secondary cancers, and cardiovascular problems.  Regular follow-up with your oncologist is crucial for monitoring for these potential complications.
