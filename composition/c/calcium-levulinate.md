# Calcium Levulinate
### Generic Name
Calcium Levulinate

### Usage
Calcium levulinate is primarily used to treat hypocalcemia, a condition characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood.  This low calcium can stem from various causes, including dietary deficiencies (inadequate calcium intake), conditions affecting calcium absorption in the gut, or certain medical disorders.  It's also used to address calcium deficiency states that occur with aging.  While it was once used as a food fortifier, single preparations of calcium levulinate supplements are largely discontinued in many countries.

### Dosage
Dosage of calcium levulinate varies significantly depending on the individual's specific needs, the severity of their hypocalcemia, and their overall health.  There isn't a universally standardized dosage across all regions or formulations.  Because single-preparation supplements are largely unavailable, dosage information would need to come directly from a physician or prescribing information if used in conjunction with other medications. It's crucial to follow the directions provided by your healthcare professional precisely.  

**Important Note:**  Due to the discontinuation of single-preparation calcium levulinate supplements, it's improbable you'll find this medication on its own.  Consult your doctor for appropriate calcium supplementation, which might involve different forms of calcium salts or be part of a broader treatment plan.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Abdominal discomfort

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels): This is a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention. Symptoms can include confusion, lethargy, and excessive thirst or urination.
* Kidney stones:  An increased risk exists with high calcium intake.
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).

If you experience any adverse effects, even mild ones, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works
Calcium levulinate works by providing supplemental calcium to the body. Once administered, it dissociates, releasing calcium ions which are absorbed into the bloodstream via the intestinal tract. This increased calcium helps restore normal blood calcium levels and addresses the underlying deficiency.  The levulinate portion of the molecule serves as a carrier for the calcium, facilitating its absorption and utilization.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Calcium levulinate should not be used in individuals with hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels), renal calculi (kidney stones), or those with a known allergy to the medication.
* **Drug Interactions:** Calcium levulinate can interact with certain medications, such as tetracyclines and some cardiac glycosides.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered under strict medical supervision due to potential risks to both mother and child.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the effects of calcium levulinate and require closer monitoring.
* **Children:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for children based on age and weight, and use should be under a physician's guidance.
