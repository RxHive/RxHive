# Cloperastine
### Generic Name
Cloperastine

### Usage
Cloperastine is primarily used to suppress non-productive coughs.  This means it's effective for coughs that don't produce mucus.  It's often prescribed for coughs associated with the common cold, influenza, or other upper respiratory tract infections where a dry, irritating cough is the main symptom. While not its primary indication, cloperastine possesses some antihistaminic activity and bronchial spasmolytic effects, suggesting a potential role in managing certain aspects of allergic or asthmatic conditions, though this is not a typical usage.  Always consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the patient's age and the formulation of cloperastine used (hydrochloride or fendizoate syrup).  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Adults:**

* **Oral (Hydrochloride):** The usual dose is 10-20 mg three times a day (TID). A common regimen is 10 mg twice during the day and 20 mg at night.
* **Oral (Fendizoate Syrup):** 20 drops (equivalent to approximately 35.4 mg) three times a day.

**Children:**

* **Use is contraindicated in children under 2 years of age.**
* Dosage for children aged 2 years and older varies considerably depending on their age and the formulation used and should be strictly as directed by a physician.  Generally, lower doses are used for younger children and are often administered in divided doses throughout the day, with a larger dose at bedtime. Consult your pediatrician for the appropriate dosage for your child.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consult your doctor if you have any concerns.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Xerostomia (dry mouth)
* Epistaxis (nosebleed)
* Dizziness
* Tremors

Less common but potentially serious side effects can include acute dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions), acute respiratory distress, atelectasis (collapsed lung), requiring immediate medical attention.


If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Cloperastine is a centrally acting cough suppressant.  This means it works by affecting the brain's cough center, reducing the urge to cough. It achieves this by selectively inhibiting the cough reflex without causing significant central nervous system (CNS) depression.  Additionally, cloperastine possesses some antihistaminic and bronchodilatory properties, though these effects are secondary to its primary cough-suppressing action.  It doesn't appear to interfere with the natural clearance of mucus from the airways.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Cloperastine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to cloperastine or other antihistamines; those concurrently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs); children under 2 years of age; and pregnant or breastfeeding women.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus (due to sucrose content in syrup formulations), increased intraocular pressure (IOP), and prostatic hypertrophy.
* **Drug Interactions:** The possibility of interactions with other medications, particularly MAOIs, exists. Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking cloperastine as it may potentiate drowsiness.
* **Driving:** Cloperastine can cause drowsiness. Avoid driving or operating machinery if you experience drowsiness.
