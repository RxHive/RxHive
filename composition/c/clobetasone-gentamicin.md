# Clobetasone + Gentamicin

**Generic Name:** Clobetasone butyrate and gentamicin sulfate

**Usage:**  This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid and antibiotic used to treat skin infections that are both inflamed and infected with bacteria.  It's typically prescribed for conditions like:

* **Infected eczema (dermatitis):**  Where inflammation and bacterial infection coexist.
* **Infected psoriasis:** Similar to eczema, but specifically for psoriasis plaques with secondary infection.
* **Infected insect bites:** When the bite becomes infected and inflamed.
* **Other inflammatory skin conditions with secondary bacterial infection:** This is a broad category and a doctor should determine suitability.

**Important Note:** This medication is for topical use only and should not be used for eye, mouth, or vaginal infections.  It should not be used to treat deep or serious infections.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the duration and area of application, as well as individual sensitivity. Common side effects include:

* **At the application site:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness, dryness, irritation, skin thinning, folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles), and hypopigmentation (loss of skin color).
* **Systemic side effects (rare, but possible with prolonged or extensive use):** These are more likely in children and with use on large surface areas.  They may include adrenal suppression (suppression of the adrenal glands' hormone production), Cushing's syndrome (a hormonal disorder), cataracts, glaucoma, and increased risk of infection.

**How it Works:**

* **Clobetasone butyrate (corticosteroid):** Reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response in the skin.  It helps to control the inflammatory component of the skin condition.
* **Gentamicin sulfate (antibiotic):** Kills bacteria that are contributing to the infection.  It's effective against a range of gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria.

The combination of these two active ingredients addresses both the inflammation and the infection simultaneously.
