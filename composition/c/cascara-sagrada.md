# Cascara Sagrada
### Generic Name
Cascara Sagrada

### Usage
Cascara sagrada is a natural laxative derived from the bark of the *Rhamnus purshiana* shrub.  Its primary use is to treat occasional constipation by stimulating bowel movements.  It's important to note that the FDA no longer considers nonprescription Cascara sagrada stimulant laxative products generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE).  Therefore, its use should be limited and under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  It is not intended for long-term use.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the formulation (dried bark, liquid extract, etc.).  Always follow the specific instructions on the product label, or as directed by a doctor or pharmacist.  **However, due to safety concerns, providing specific dosage recommendations here is not advisable.**  Self-medicating with Cascara sagrada is discouraged, and a healthcare provider should be consulted before use, especially for chronic constipation or other underlying bowel issues.  The drug is generally not recommended for children under 10 years of age.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

*   Gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances (e.g., cramps, nausea, vomiting)
*   Diarrhea
*   Electrolyte imbalance (with prolonged use)
*   Discoloration of urine (harmless)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Melanosis coli (benign, reversible darkening of the colon)
*   Dehydration (due to diarrhea)


If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Cascara sagrada contains anthraquinone glycosides, which stimulate the intestines.  These compounds irritate the bowel lining, increasing intestinal motility and drawing water into the colon, resulting in a bowel movement.  The mechanism is primarily a direct stimulant effect on the smooth muscles of the large intestine.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Cascara sagrada is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), appendicitis, abdominal pain, severe constipation, rectal bleeding, ileus, or gastric ulcers.  It should not be used for prolonged periods (more than one week).


**Interactions:**  Cascara sagrada may interact with other medications, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal tract or electrolyte balance. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions before using Cascara sagrada if you are taking other medications.


**Specific Warnings:**  This laxative is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women due to potential emmenagogue (stimulating menstruation) and abortifacient (inducing abortion) effects and the possibility of anthranoid metabolites being excreted in breast milk. It should not be used in children under 10 years of age.  Older adults should exercise caution and consult a healthcare provider before use.
