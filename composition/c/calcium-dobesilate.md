# Calcium Dobesilate
### Generic Name
Calcium Dobesilate

### Usage

Calcium dobesilate is primarily used to manage symptoms associated with venous insufficiency.  This means it helps alleviate symptoms related to poor blood flow in the veins.  Specific conditions where it's used include:

* **Diabetic retinopathy:** Calcium dobesilate helps manage the symptoms of diabetic retinopathy related to venous insufficiency, improving visual function by addressing the underlying vascular issues.  It does not cure the retinopathy itself.

* **Hemorrhoids:** It's used to treat the symptoms of hemorrhoids, reducing pain and inflammation.

* **Venous insufficiency due to various causes:** This includes venous insufficiency stemming from vascular injury, diabetic capillary disease, post-thrombotic syndrome (after a blood clot), or peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities).  It aims to improve blood circulation and reduce related symptoms like swelling and pain.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response.  Always follow your doctor's prescription.  Generally:

**Adults:**

* **Diabetic retinopathy and venous insufficiency (due to vascular injury):** The typical oral dosage is 500-1000 mg per day.

* **Chronic venous insufficiency and hemorrhoids:**  Treatment usually begins with 750 mg orally per day for 1-3 weeks, followed by a reduction to 500 mg daily.

**Children:**

The safety and efficacy of calcium dobesilate in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children unless specifically prescribed and monitored by a pediatrician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised, and dosage reduction may be considered for patients with severe kidney impairment, particularly those undergoing dialysis.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Increased serum ALT level (liver enzyme)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1% or post-marketing reports):**

* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)
* Agranulocytosis (severe deficiency of granulocytes, a type of white blood cell)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Chills
* Facial edema (swelling)
* Fatigue
* Fever
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Lethargy


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Calcium dobesilate acts as a vasoprotective agent, meaning it protects blood vessels. It works through multiple mechanisms:

* **Capillary stabilization:** It strengthens capillary walls, reducing their permeability (leakiness) and fragility.

* **Inhibition of vasoactive substances:** It reduces the effects of substances that constrict blood vessels, such as histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, and others. This promotes better blood flow.

* **Suppression of collagen formation:** It helps to reduce the excessive collagen formation that can contribute to scar tissue and impaired blood vessel function.

* **Improved blood flow properties:** It reduces blood viscosity (thickness), inhibits platelet aggregation (clumping), and increases erythrocyte (red blood cell) flexibility, improving blood flow.

* **Increased lymphatic drainage:** It enhances the body's ability to remove excess fluid from tissues, reducing swelling.

By acting on these various pathways, calcium dobesilate improves blood circulation in the veins and reduces symptoms associated with venous insufficiency.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Calcium dobesilate is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to it or any of its components.

* **Increased Risk:** There's an increased risk of agranulocytosis (severe reduction in white blood cells). Regular blood tests may be necessary during treatment.

* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment and in patients with sulfite allergy (as some formulations may contain sulfites).

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Calcium dobesilate is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Avoid use during pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  It's excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take calcium dobesilate with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to discuss all medications you take with your doctor or pharmacist to avoid potential drug interactions.

* **Q: How should I store calcium dobesilate?** A:  Store as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How long will it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the condition and individual response.  Consistent use and regular check-ups with your doctor are essential.

* **Q: Are there any dietary restrictions while taking calcium dobesilate?** A:  No specific dietary restrictions are usually recommended, but maintaining a healthy diet is always beneficial.  Consult your doctor if you have any specific dietary concerns.
