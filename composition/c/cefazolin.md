# Cefazolin

**Generic Name:** Cefazolin

**Usage:** Cefazolin is a cephalosporin antibiotic used to prevent and treat a wide range of bacterial infections.  These infections can affect various parts of the body, including:

* **Skin and skin structures:**  Boils, cellulitis, abscesses, wound infections.
* **Respiratory tract:** Pneumonia, bronchitis.
* **Genitourinary tract:** Urinary tract infections (UTIs), pelvic inflammatory disease.
* **Bone and joint infections:** Osteomyelitis.
* **Sepsis:** A life-threatening bloodstream infection.
* **Prophylaxis:** Preventing infections during surgery (especially those involving the abdomen, heart, or joints).


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, cefazolin can cause side effects.  These vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Mild:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash, itching.
* **Less Common but More Serious:**  Pseudomembranous colitis (a severe intestinal infection), allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis), increased risk of bleeding (especially in patients taking anticoagulants), kidney problems, seizures (especially in patients with kidney disease), thrombophlebitis (inflammation of the vein at the injection site).
* **Rare but Serious:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), liver problems, neutropenia (low white blood cell count), hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells).


**How it Works:** Cefazolin is a beta-lactam antibiotic.  It works by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  This disruption weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to bacterial cell death.  Cefazolin is bactericidal, meaning it kills bacteria directly.  Its effectiveness varies depending on the specific bacteria causing the infection.


**FAQs:**

* **Is cefazolin safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?**  While generally considered safe, it's crucial to consult a doctor before using cefazolin during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  The benefits should be weighed against potential risks to the fetus or infant.

* **Can I take cefazolin with other medications?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements you are taking, as cefazolin can interact with some drugs, especially those affecting kidneys or blood clotting.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?**  Allergic reactions can range from mild rash and itching to severe symptoms like difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, and dizziness.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe allergic reaction.

* **How long does it take to work?**  The time it takes to see improvement depends on the type and severity of the infection.  You may start to feel better within a few days, but you must complete the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking cefazolin?**  While there is no direct interaction, alcohol can sometimes worsen side effects like nausea and stomach upset.  Consult your doctor if you have concerns.
