### How it Works

Conjugated estrogens synthetic A contains a mixture of synthetic estrogens. Estrogens are hormones that play crucial roles in the development and function of the female reproductive system.  In postmenopausal women, estrogen levels decline, leading to symptoms like hot flashes and vaginal atrophy.  This medication replaces the missing estrogen, relieving these symptoms by binding to estrogen receptors in the body and restoring hormonal balance.  It also helps to maintain the health and integrity of vaginal tissues.
