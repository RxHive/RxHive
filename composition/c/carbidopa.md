# Carbidopa
### Generic Name
Carbidopa

### Usage
Carbidopa is an anti-Parkinsonian drug.  It's not used alone; it's always administered in combination with levodopa. This combination is used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including both idiopathic Parkinson's disease (the most common type) and Parkinsonism that arises from other causes such as post-encephalitic parkinsonism (following encephalitis) or  symptomatic parkinsonism (following nervous system damage from conditions like carbon monoxide poisoning or manganese intoxication).  The primary use is to improve motor control and reduce the tremors, rigidity, slow movement (bradykinesia), and other motor difficulties characteristic of Parkinson's disease.  While not a primary use, the combination therapy also helps reduce some of the side effects often associated with levodopa alone.

### Dosage
Carbidopa dosage is highly individualized and requires careful titration by a healthcare professional. It's crucial to remember that carbidopa is *always* used with levodopa, and the precise ratio of the two medications is critical for effectiveness.  The most common ratio is 10:1 (levodopa:carbidopa).  

**Adult Dosage (with Levodopa):**  Dosage starts low and is gradually increased to find the optimal level for each individual.  The initial dose of carbidopa might be 25 mg daily, often with the first dose of the levodopa/carbidopa combination.  Further increases are made in increments of 12.5-25 mg per day, as guided by the healthcare provider. The maximum daily dose is usually 200 mg, though this includes any carbidopa already present in a combined levodopa/carbidopa preparation. Specific starting and adjusting doses depend on the patient's current levodopa regimen (if any).  A healthcare professional will meticulously adjust the dose based on individual patient response and tolerance.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of carbidopa in children under 18 have not been established. It's not recommended for use in this age group.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  A healthcare provider should carefully monitor patients with these conditions.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Involuntary movements (dyskinesias)
*  Orthostatic hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)
*  Headache
* Insomnia

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Hallucinations
*  Severe depression (including suicidal thoughts)
*  Cardiac arrhythmias
*  Liver problems
*  Skin reactions

If any adverse effects occur, it's important to consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Carbidopa works by inhibiting an enzyme called dopa decarboxylase.  This enzyme is found in the body's periphery (outside the brain). Levodopa, when taken alone, is largely converted into dopamine in the periphery. This peripheral conversion leads to side effects like nausea and vomiting.  Carbidopa blocks this peripheral conversion, allowing more levodopa to reach the brain, where it's converted into dopamine.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter essential for smooth muscle movement and coordination, and its deficiency is central to Parkinson's disease symptoms. By increasing the amount of dopamine available in the brain, carbidopa-levodopa combination therapy helps improve motor function and reduce Parkinson's symptoms.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Carbidopa is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to carbidopa or any component of the medication. It should not be used with non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) within 14 days of starting or stopping either medication. Narrow-angle glaucoma is another contraindication.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Carbidopa can interact with various drugs, including MAOIs.  A healthcare provider should be informed of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Carbidopa is a category C drug during pregnancy, meaning the risk to the fetus isn't fully known.  It should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. The excretion of carbidopa into breast milk is unknown, requiring careful consideration by healthcare providers when determining whether to continue breastfeeding.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may be more susceptible to some side effects of carbidopa, such as orthostatic hypotension and falls. Close monitoring is essential.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take carbidopa alone?** A: No, carbidopa is always used in combination with levodopa; it has no significant anti-Parkinsonian effect on its own.

* **Q: How should I store carbidopa?** A: Store carbidopa as directed on the prescription label, usually at room temperature away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist for guidance. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking carbidopa suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping carbidopa (or the levodopa/carbidopa combination) can lead to serious withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult a healthcare professional before making changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of carbidopa?** A: Long-term use can be associated with some risks. Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider, including periodic skin examinations, and assessment of neurological and mental status are crucial.
