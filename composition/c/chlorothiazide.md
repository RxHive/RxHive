# Chlorothiazide
### Generic Name
Chlorothiazide

### Usage
Chlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). It can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications, particularly in cases of more severe hypertension.  Beyond hypertension, it's also employed as adjunctive therapy (additional treatment) for edema (swelling) associated with conditions like congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis (liver disease), and fluid retention caused by corticosteroid or estrogen therapy.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage is highly individualized based on patient response. The lowest effective dose should always be used.

* **Hypertension (Oral):** 500-2000 mg daily, divided into 1-2 doses. The dosage is adjusted based on blood pressure response. The maximum daily dose is 2000 mg.

* **Edema (Oral/IV):** Initial dose: 500-1000 mg (10-20 mL) once or twice daily.  Intermittent dosing (e.g., every other day or 3-5 days a week) may also be used.

* **Heart Failure (ACCF/AHA 2013 Guidelines):** Oral: 250-500 mg once or twice daily.  Maximum daily dose: 1000 mg. IV: 500-1000 mg daily, often combined with a loop diuretic for enhanced effect.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage is calculated based on weight and condition. Always follow a physician's specific instructions.

* **Edema/Hypertension (Oral):** Children under 6 months: Up to 30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Children 6 months to 2 years: 10-20 mg/kg/day, in one or two divided doses, not exceeding 375 mg/day. Children 2-12 years:  dosage should be determined by a physician.

* **Edema/Hypertension (IV):** 5-10 mg/kg/day in one or two divided doses (physician's order required).

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for liver impairment; however, use caution in patients with liver disease.

* **Renal Impairment:** Avoid use if creatinine clearance (CrCl) is less than 10 mL/min.  Chlorothiazide is largely ineffective with CrCl less than 30 mL/min unless used in combination with a loop diuretic.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Muscle cramps
* Weakness
* Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing)

Less common but serious side effects:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Pancreatitis
* Jaundice
* Blood disorders (agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia)
* Renal failure
* Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, hypomagnesemia)

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any adverse effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Chlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. It works by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions in the kidney's distal tubules. This increased excretion of sodium and chloride leads to increased water excretion (diuresis), reducing fluid volume and consequently lowering blood pressure.  The drug also affects the excretion of other electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and calcium.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Chlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to chlorothiazide, sulfonamides, or any component of the formulation;  anuria (absence of urine production); and concomitant use with lithium.

* **Drug Interactions:** Chlorothiazide can interact with numerous medications.  Significant interactions include increased risk of lithium toxicity, potentiation of orthostatic hypotension with barbiturates and narcotics, reduced effectiveness of antidiabetics, additive effects with other antihypertensives, reduced diuretic absorption with cholestyramine and colestipol, intensified electrolyte depletion with corticosteroids, and reduced diuretic effect with NSAIDs.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with all other medications you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with diabetes, hepatic or renal impairment, high cholesterol, hypokalemia, and a history of gout.  Chlorothiazide may cause photosensitivity, so protect skin from excessive sun exposure.  It can also worsen existing electrolyte imbalances.  Monitor for signs of electrolyte imbalance and adjust therapy as needed.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Chlorothiazide is a Category C pregnancy drug. It crosses the placenta and may harm the fetus.  It is excreted in breast milk.  The decision to use during pregnancy or breastfeeding must be carefully weighed against the potential risks.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take chlorothiazide with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking before starting chlorothiazide, due to potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for your next dose.  Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store chlorothiazide?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking chlorothiazide suddenly?** A: No,  sudden discontinuation can be harmful. Always follow your doctor's instructions on tapering off the medication.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.  Some side effects are mild and may resolve, but others require medical attention.
