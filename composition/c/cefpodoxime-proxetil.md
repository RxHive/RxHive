# Cefpodoxime Proxetil
### Generic Name
Cefpodoxime Proxetil

### Usage

Cefpodoxime proxetil is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the cephalosporin family.  Its primary use is in treating various bacterial infections.  Specifically, it's effective against infections of the:

* **Respiratory Tract:**  Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, pharyngitis (strep throat), and acute maxillary sinusitis (sinus infection).
* **Skin and Skin Structures:** Uncomplicated skin infections and infections of the skin's deeper layers.
* **Urinary Tract:** Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (cystitis – bladder infection).
* **Reproductive System:** Uncomplicated gonorrhea.

While not its primary indication, cefpodoxime proxetil may be used as an alternative treatment for certain infections in patients allergic to penicillin.  This includes acute otitis media (middle ear infection) in penicillin-allergic individuals who tolerate cephalosporins.  It's crucial to note that using this medication for conditions not explicitly listed requires professional medical guidance.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the infection being treated, the patient's age, weight, and kidney function.  Always follow your doctor's prescription exactly.  The following information is for general understanding and should not replace professional medical advice.

**Adults:** Dosage ranges from 100 mg to 400 mg, taken twice daily (BID). Treatment duration also varies, typically ranging from 5 to 14 days, depending on the infection.  For uncomplicated gonorrhea, a single 200 mg dose may be sufficient.

**Children:** Dosage is usually calculated based on weight, typically 5 mg per kilogram of body weight, given twice daily. The maximum dose per dose varies depending on the specific infection and child's age, often capped at 200 mg.  Treatment duration depends on the infection and the child's age.  

**Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function.  Those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) below 30 mL/min require a once-daily dosage, or a modified dosing schedule after hemodialysis. Your doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on your kidney function.

**Forms:** Cefpodoxime proxetil is available in both tablet and oral suspension (liquid) forms.


### Side Effects

Like most medications, cefpodoxime proxetil can cause side effects.  These are usually mild and temporary, but serious side effects are possible though less frequent.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Skin rash

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis – a life-threatening emergency)
* Pseudomembranous colitis (a severe intestinal infection)
* Changes in blood counts
* Liver problems (rare)


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Cefpodoxime proxetil is a bactericidal antibiotic. This means it kills bacteria rather than merely inhibiting their growth. It achieves this by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  Specifically, it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) within the bacteria, disrupting the final steps of peptidoglycan synthesis – a critical component of the bacterial cell wall. This disruption weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to bacterial lysis (rupture and death).


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Cefpodoxime proxetil should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to cephalosporin antibiotics or any of its components.  A history of severe allergic reactions to penicillin also increases the risk of a reaction to cefpodoxime proxetil.
* **Kidney Function:** Individuals with impaired kidney function require dosage adjustments.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While generally considered safe, pregnant and breastfeeding women should discuss cefpodoxime proxetil use with their doctors.
* **Interactions:** Cefpodoxime proxetil can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking.  Antacids, H2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors can reduce cefpodoxime's effectiveness.
* **Superinfection:** Prolonged use can lead to the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, causing secondary infections (e.g., fungal infections).

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking cefpodoxime proxetil?** A:  Alcohol is generally not recommended while on antibiotics, although there isn't a direct interaction with cefpodoxime. Consult your doctor.
* **Q:  How should I store cefpodoxime proxetil?** A:  Store it as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking cefpodoxime proxetil when I feel better?** A: No, complete the entire course of treatment, even if you feel better, to prevent the recurrence of infection and the development of antibiotic resistance.
* **Q:  Is cefpodoxime proxetil safe for children?** A: Yes, but the dosage needs to be adjusted based on the child's weight and age, as determined by a physician.
