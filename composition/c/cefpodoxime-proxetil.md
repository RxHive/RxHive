# Cefpodoxime Proxetil

**Generic Name:** Cefpodoxime Proxetil

**Usage:** Cefpodoxime proxetil is an oral antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, including:

* **Respiratory tract infections:**  Bronchitis, pneumonia (certain types), sinusitis, and pharyngitis (strep throat).
* **Skin and skin structure infections:** Cellulitis, impetigo, and abscesses.
* **Ear infections (otitis media):** Particularly in children.
* **Genitourinary infections:**  Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs).

**Important Note:**  Cefpodoxime proxetil is only effective against bacterial infections. It will not work for viral infections like the common cold or flu.  Always consult a doctor to determine the cause of your infection before starting treatment.  Improper use can lead to antibiotic resistance.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, cefpodoxime proxetil can cause side effects.  These are usually mild and temporary, but some can be serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives.  Rarely, more serious allergic reactions like angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) or anaphylaxis can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
* **Headache**
* **Vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis)**:  This is more common in women.
* **Changes in taste**

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD):** This is a serious bowel infection.
* **Seizures:** More likely in patients with pre-existing kidney problems or those taking high doses.
* **Blood disorders:**  Rare but potentially serious.

This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of possible side effects.


**How it Works:** Cefpodoxime proxetil is a cephalosporin antibiotic.  It works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to build their cell walls.  This weakens the bacteria, making them unable to grow and reproduce, eventually leading to their death.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take cefpodoxime proxetil with other medications?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, you are taking.  Some medications may interact with cefpodoxime proxetil.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **How long should I take cefpodoxime proxetil?**  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Do not stop taking the medication prematurely, even if you feel better.  Stopping treatment early can lead to recurrence of the infection and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any side effects, especially serious ones.
* **Is cefpodoxime proxetil safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Consult your doctor before taking cefpodoxime proxetil if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking cefpodoxime proxetil?**  Alcohol may interact with some medications, although this interaction is not usually significant with cefpodoxime.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Can I take cefpodoxime proxetil if I have allergies to penicillin?** Cephalosporins (like cefpodoxime) are related to penicillins. If you have a severe allergy to penicillin, you may also be allergic to cephalosporins.  Inform your doctor of any allergies before taking this medication.
