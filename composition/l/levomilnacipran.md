# Levomilnacipran

**Generic Name:** Levomilnacipran

**Usage:** Levomilnacipran is used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).  It's a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).  It's typically prescribed when other treatments haven't been effective.  The dosage and duration of treatment are determined by a doctor based on individual needs and response.

**Side Effects:**  Like many medications, levo-milnacipran can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Nausea:** This is a frequently reported side effect, often lessening over time.
* **Constipation:**  Changes in bowel habits are possible.
* **Sweating:** Increased sweating, including night sweats.
* **Decreased Appetite/Weight Loss:** Some individuals experience a reduction in appetite.
* **Insomnia or Sleep Disturbances:** Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.
* **Dizziness or Lightheadedness:**  Feeling faint or unsteady.
* **Dry Mouth:** Reduced saliva production.
* **Increased Blood Pressure:**  Though usually mild, blood pressure monitoring may be necessary.
* **Sexual Dysfunction:**  This is a potential side effect affecting libido, arousal, or orgasm.
* **Headache:**  Headaches are a relatively common side effect.

**Serious side effects, though less common, include:**

* **Serotonin Syndrome:** A rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, agitation, muscle rigidity, and rapid heart rate.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
* **Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors:**  While less likely with antidepressants, worsening of depression or emergence of suicidal thoughts can occur, especially in younger adults.  Close monitoring is crucial.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Rare but potentially severe allergic reactions, such as rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing, require immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:** Levomilnacipran is an SNRI, meaning it works by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain.  These neurotransmitters are involved in regulating mood, sleep, and other functions. By increasing their levels, levo-milnacipran helps to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety.
