# Levomilnacipran
### Generic Name
Levomilnacipran

### Usage
Levomilnacipran is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.  It's a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), meaning it works by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain.  These neurotransmitters play crucial roles in mood regulation.  It is important to note that Levomilnacipran is *not* approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia.

### Dosage

**Adults (Major Depressive Disorder):** Levomilnacipran is administered orally.  The usual starting dose is 20 mg once daily for two days, then increased to 40 mg once daily.  The dose may be further increased, based on individual response and tolerability, in increments of 20 or 40 mg at intervals of two or more days, up to a maximum of 120 mg once daily.  The maintenance dose typically ranges from 40 mg to 120 mg once daily.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Levomilnacipran have not been established in children; therefore, it is not approved for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with mild to moderate liver impairment.  However, close monitoring is recommended.  Severe hepatic impairment requires careful consideration and potential dose reduction or avoidance of the drug.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment.  For those with mild impairment (creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min), no adjustment is usually required.  Moderate impairment (creatinine clearance 30–59 mL/min) may necessitate a maximum dose of 80 mg daily, while severe impairment (creatinine clearance 15–29 mL/min) may require a maximum dose of 40 mg daily.  Levomilnacipran is generally not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Concomitant use with strong inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) may require a reduction in the Levomilnacipran dose to a maximum of 80 mg daily.
* **Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs):**  A significant time gap is required between stopping MAOIs and starting Levomilnacipran, and vice versa, to avoid potentially dangerous interactions.  At least 14 days should elapse after stopping an MAOI for psychiatric disorders before initiating Levomilnacipran, and at least 7 days should pass after stopping Levomilnacipran before starting an MAOI antidepressant.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing)
* Nausea

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nervous system:  Agitation, aggression, insomnia, migraine, dizziness, tremor, anxiety,  extrapyramidal symptoms
* Cardiovascular: Increased heart rate (tachycardia), palpitations, hypertension, hypotension, chest pain, syncope (fainting)
* Gastrointestinal: Constipation, vomiting, decreased appetite, abdominal pain
* Dermatologic:  Increased sweating (hyperhidrosis), rash, itching (pruritus)
* Other:  Dry mouth, fatigue, blurred vision,  sexual dysfunction (e.g., erectile dysfunction, decreased libido)

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition)
* Angle-closure glaucoma
* Seizures
* Bleeding problems
* Suicidal thoughts or behaviors
* Worsening of pre-existing cardiovascular conditions


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Levomilnacipran is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).  It works by blocking the reabsorption (reuptake) of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. This increases the levels of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, enhancing their effects and potentially improving mood, energy, and focus.  The exact mechanism by which this leads to antidepressant effects is still not fully understood, but it's believed to be related to its influence on neurotransmitter signaling pathways in the brain.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Levomilnacipran is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Levomilnacipran or milnacipran, those currently taking MAOIs (or within a specific timeframe of stopping them), patients with recent myocardial infarction or cardiac intervention, uncontrolled tachyarrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension, or a history of cerebrovascular accident.
* **Interactions:**  Levomilnacipran may interact with other medications, including MAOIs, certain CYP3A4 inhibitors, and drugs that affect bleeding.  Consult a doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Levomilnacipran is a pregnancy Category C drug.  Use during pregnancy requires careful assessment of risks and benefits.  It's not known whether Levomilnacipran is excreted in human milk.  Decisions regarding breastfeeding should consider the potential risks and benefits to both mother and infant.
* **Specific Populations:**  Older adults, individuals with renal or hepatic impairment, patients with a history of seizures, or those with a history of bipolar disorder require close monitoring while on Levomilnacipran.
* **Suicidal Ideation:**  There is an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially in younger adults, when taking antidepressants. Close monitoring is essential.
* **Discontinuation Syndrome:** Abrupt discontinuation may lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Tapering the dose gradually is recommended to minimize these effects.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Levomilnacipran?** A:  It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking Levomilnacipran, as alcohol can interact with the medication and worsen side effects.
* **Q: How should I store Levomilnacipran?** A:  Store Levomilnacipran at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Levomilnacipran suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping Levomilnacipran can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before discontinuing the medication. A gradual tapering of the dose is generally recommended.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience serious side effects?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience serious side effects, such as severe allergic reactions, chest pain, or suicidal thoughts.
