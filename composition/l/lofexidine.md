# Lofexidine
### Generic Name
Lofexidine

### Usage
Lofexidine is primarily used to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms in adults.  It helps to lessen the intensity and discomfort associated with stopping opioid use, allowing for a more manageable and safer discontinuation process.  It's not a treatment for opioid use disorder itself; rather, it's a tool to facilitate the detoxification phase under medical supervision.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Opioid Withdrawal):** Lofexidine is administered orally. The typical starting dose is 0.54 mg (three 0.18 mg tablets) four times daily (QID) during the period of peak withdrawal symptoms (usually the first 5-7 days after the last opioid dose).  Dosage is adjusted based on individual symptoms and tolerance, with a maximum daily dose of 2.88 mg (16 tablets) and a maximum single dose of 0.72 mg (4 tablets). Treatment can last up to 14 days, tapering off gradually over 2-4 days to minimize withdrawal from Lofexidine itself.  Lower doses may be used as withdrawal symptoms improve.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage reduction is necessary for patients with liver problems.  Specific adjustments depend on the severity of the impairment (Child-Pugh score) and are best determined by a healthcare professional.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are also needed for patients with kidney issues. Again, adjustments depend on the severity (eGFR) and should be guided by a doctor.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Lofexidine in children have not been established.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Nervous system: Insomnia, dizziness, sedation, drowsiness
* Cardiovascular: Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Gastrointestinal: Dry mouth (xerostomia)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Syncope (fainting)
* Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
* Prolonged QT interval on ECG (which can lead to potentially fatal heart rhythm abnormalities)
* Torsades de pointes (a type of irregular heartbeat)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Lofexidine is a central alpha-2 adrenergic agonist.  This means it works by binding to specific receptors (alpha-2 adrenergic receptors) in the brain. This action reduces the release of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter involved in the "fight-or-flight" response and also plays a role in opioid withdrawal symptoms. By decreasing norepinephrine activity, Lofexidine helps to alleviate symptoms such as anxiety, sweating, and muscle aches often experienced during opioid withdrawal.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Lofexidine should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Lofexidine.

**Warnings:**

* Lofexidine can increase the risk of QT prolongation, hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope (fainting).
* It can enhance the central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other sedatives.
* Use with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
*  It may interact with various medications, including antihypertensives, tricyclic antidepressants, and drugs that prolong the QT interval.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* The safety of Lofexidine during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established; therefore, it is generally not recommended during pregnancy and should be used with caution during breastfeeding.
