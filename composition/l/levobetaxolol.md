# Levobetaxolol
### Generic Name
Levobetaxolol

### Usage
Levobetaxolol is primarily used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  These conditions involve increased pressure within the eye, which can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss. Levobetaxolol helps manage this pressure, preventing further damage and preserving vision. It's important to note that levobetaxolol does not treat the underlying cause of glaucoma or ocular hypertension; it only manages a symptom.


### Dosage
**Adults (Chronic open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension):**  The typical dose is one drop of 0.5% levobetaxolol ophthalmic suspension in the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID).  The full IOP-lowering effect may not be seen for a few weeks, requiring consistent use.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of levobetaxolol in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children unless specifically directed by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However,  individuals with these conditions should be monitored closely by their doctor while using levobetaxolol.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Transient blurred vision
* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye
* Eye dryness
* Headache
* Dizziness

Less common, but more serious side effects, can include:

* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Bronchospasm (constriction of the airways)
* Allergic reactions (such as rash, itching, swelling)

If you experience any serious or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Levobetaxolol is a cardioselective (beta-1 adrenergic) receptor blocker. It works by reducing the production of aqueous humor, the fluid that fills the front part of the eye. By decreasing the amount of fluid produced, the pressure within the eye is lowered.  It's important to remember that it primarily affects beta-1 receptors, minimizing impact on the lungs compared to non-selective beta-blockers.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Levobetaxolol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to levobetaxolol, betaxolol, or any component of the formulation; sinus bradycardia; second- or third-degree atrioventricular block; cardiogenic shock; and overt cardiac failure.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Levobetaxolol should be used cautiously with other beta-blockers (oral or ophthalmic), catecholamine-depleting drugs (like reserpine), and adrenergic psychotropic drugs.  The combined effects may be additive, leading to hypotension or bradycardia.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Levobetaxolol is a Category C drug during pregnancy.  It should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.

* **Specific Populations:**  Patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart conditions, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or myasthenia gravis should use levobetaxolol with caution and under close medical supervision.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for levobetaxolol to work?**  A: The full effect on IOP may take a few weeks. Consistent use is crucial.

* **Q: Can I wear contact lenses while using levobetaxolol?** A: Remove contact lenses before application and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember.  If it's almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store levobetaxolol?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I stop using levobetaxolol abruptly?** A: No, abrupt discontinuation should be avoided. Consult your doctor before stopping treatment.
