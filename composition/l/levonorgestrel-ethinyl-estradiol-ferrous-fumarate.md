# Levonorgestrel + Ethinyl Estradiol + Ferrous Fumarate
### Generic Name
Levonorgestrel + Ethinyl Estradiol + Ferrous Fumarate


### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used as an oral contraceptive, preventing pregnancy.  It contains three active ingredients: levonorgestrel (a progestin), ethinyl estradiol (an estrogen), and ferrous fumarate (iron). The levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol work together to prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), thicken the cervical mucus (making it harder for sperm to reach the egg), and alter the uterine lining, making it less likely for a fertilized egg to implant.  The addition of ferrous fumarate addresses potential iron deficiencies that can occur, particularly in women of reproductive age or those experiencing menstrual bleeding.  While its primary function is contraception, some formulations might be prescribed to manage certain menstrual irregularities, although this isn't the primary intended use.


### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific formulation and the manufacturer.  It is crucial to follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist precisely.  Generally, this medication is taken orally, usually one tablet daily at roughly the same time each day.  There is no IV formulation of this combination drug.  The packaging will clearly outline the daily dosage, and missing even one dose can reduce the effectiveness of the medication as a contraceptive.  Children should not take this medication; it is specifically formulated for adult women.  Women should consult their physician before starting this medication, or any contraceptive medication, to ensure it is appropriate for their individual health profile.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

*   Breast tenderness
*   Nausea
*   Headaches
*   Mood changes
*   Weight changes
*   Spotting or breakthrough bleeding
*   Changes in libido

Less common, but more serious side effects, that require immediate medical attention:

*   Severe abdominal pain
*   Chest pain
*   Shortness of breath
*   Leg pain or swelling (potential signs of blood clots)
*   Severe headache or vision changes (potential signs of stroke)
*   Jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes)


If you experience any of these side effects, seek immediate medical attention.  This list is not exhaustive; consult your healthcare provider for a complete understanding of potential side effects.


### How it Works
This combination medication functions through a hormonal mechanism. Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol work synergistically to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, preventing the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This, in turn, inhibits ovulation.  Simultaneously, these hormones increase cervical mucus viscosity, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg. Finally, they alter the endometrium (uterine lining), making implantation of a fertilized egg less likely. The addition of ferrous fumarate provides supplemental iron, addressing potential anemia often associated with menstruation.


### Precautions
*   This medication is not suitable for everyone.  Individuals with a history of blood clots, stroke, heart disease, certain types of cancers, liver disease, or undiagnosed vaginal bleeding should not use this medication.
*   Smoking significantly increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects when taking this medication; smokers should discuss alternative contraceptive methods with their doctor.
*   Interactions with other medications are possible; inform your physician about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.
*   Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not take this medication unless explicitly advised by their doctor.
*   This medication may affect glucose tolerance and may worsen symptoms in women with diabetes.  Careful monitoring of blood sugar levels may be necessary.
*   Older adults typically do not need this medication.
