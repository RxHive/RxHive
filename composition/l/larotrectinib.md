# Larotrectinib
### Generic Name
Larotrectinib

### Usage

Larotrectinib is a targeted therapy used to treat certain types of solid tumors in adults and children.  Its primary use is in patients whose tumors have a neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusion. This fusion creates an abnormal protein that drives the growth of cancer cells.  Larotrectinib works by blocking the activity of this abnormal protein, thereby slowing or stopping tumor growth.  The drug is typically used for tumors that have spread (metastatic) or where surgery would cause significant harm, and for cases where other treatments haven't been effective or have stopped working.  It's important to note that a tumor biopsy showing an NTRK gene fusion is necessary before treatment with Larotrectinib can be considered.


### Dosage

Dosage for Larotrectinib varies depending on several factors, including age, body surface area (BSA), and the presence of liver or kidney problems.

**Adults:**  The usual dose is 100 mg twice daily (BID) by mouth, continued until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.

**Children:** The dosage is calculated based on the child's BSA.  For children with a BSA of less than 1 m², the dose is 100 mg/m²/dose BID.  For children with a BSA of 1 m² or greater, the dose is 100 mg BID.  Both capsule and oral solution forms are available; they may be used interchangeably.  Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage may need to be adjusted in patients with liver problems.  Those with mild impairment (Child-Pugh class A) generally do not require adjustment; however, moderate-to-severe impairment (Child-Pugh classes B and C) necessitates a 50% dose reduction.  Kidney problems usually do not require dosage adjustments.  Dose modifications might also be necessary to manage side effects or interactions with other medications. Consult the prescribing information for specific details on dose adjustments in various scenarios.

### Side Effects

Larotrectinib, like many cancer medications, can cause side effects.  The frequency and severity of side effects vary among individuals.

**Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

*   Fatigue
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Constipation
*   Diarrhea
*   Decreased appetite
*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Peripheral edema (swelling)
*   Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, ALP)
*   Anemia
*   Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
*   Hypertension (high blood pressure)
*   Pain (muscle, joint, back, limb)
*   Cough
*   Shortness of breath


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention:

*   Neurotoxicity (problems with the nervous system)
*   Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
*   Serious allergic reactions
*   Severe low blood counts
*   Severe infections
*   Intestinal issues (obstruction, perforation)
*   Fluid imbalances


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Larotrectinib is a type of medication called a kinase inhibitor. It works by targeting specific proteins called tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRKs), which are involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells.  In tumors with NTRK gene fusions, these TRK proteins are abnormally active, promoting uncontrolled cell growth.  Larotrectinib selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of these TRK proteins, thereby blocking the signals that promote cancer cell growth and survival, ultimately slowing or stopping tumor progression.


### Precautions

*   **Allergic Reactions:**  Larotrectinib is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to it or any of its components.
*   **Liver and Kidney Function:**  Liver function should be monitored regularly, particularly in patients with pre-existing liver impairment.  Kidney function usually does not require specific monitoring.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Larotrectinib can harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one week after the last dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for one week afterward.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Larotrectinib's metabolism can be affected by other medications, particularly those that inhibit or induce the CYP3A4 enzyme. Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers should be avoided or carefully managed with dose adjustments.  Grapefruit juice should be avoided due to its potential interaction.
*   **Neurotoxicity:**  Monitor for neurologic symptoms; patients experiencing neurotoxicity should avoid activities requiring alertness.

### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take Larotrectinib with food?**  A: Yes, Larotrectinib can be taken with or without food.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A:  Do not take a missed dose if it is within 6 hours of the next scheduled dose. Take the next dose as scheduled.

*   **Q: How is Larotrectinib stored?** A:  Refer to the medication label and the accompanying instructions for detailed storage recommendations.

*   **Q: Are there long-term effects associated with Larotrectinib?** A:  Long-term effects are still under investigation. Regular monitoring and follow-up with your healthcare provider are essential.

*   **Q: How is the NTRK gene fusion status determined?** A:  This is determined through a biopsy of the tumor tissue, followed by molecular testing to detect the presence of the NTRK gene fusion.
