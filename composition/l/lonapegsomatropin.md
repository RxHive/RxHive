# Lonapegsomatropin
### Generic Name
Lonapegsomatropin

### Usage
Lonapegsomatropin is a long-acting growth hormone used primarily to treat children aged 1 year and older (weighing at least 11.5 kg) with growth failure due to inadequate growth hormone production (growth hormone deficiency).  It helps stimulate growth by mimicking the effects of naturally occurring growth hormone.


### Dosage

Lonapegsomatropin is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) once weekly using a pre-filled cartridge and a specialized autoinjector.  Dosage is individualized based on the child's weight and response to treatment.  The manufacturer provides a detailed weight-based dosing chart for children weighing 11.5 kg and above.  For example, children weighing 11.5 to less than 14 kg receive 3 mg once weekly, while those weighing 85-100 kg receive 22 mg once weekly (administered in two separate injections).  Precise instructions on cartridge preparation and administration using the autoinjector are crucial and should be carefully followed as detailed in the prescribing information.  Note that there's no specific dosage adjustment for hepatic or renal impairment in current labelling. Switching from daily somatropin requires an 8-hour gap between the last somatropin dose and the first lonapegsomatropin dose.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Increased serum phosphate levels
* Nausea and vomiting
* Increased serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels
* Viral infections
* Cough
* Fever

Less common side effects (1-10% of patients) include:

* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Hemorrhage (bruising, nosebleeds, eye hemorrhage, petechiae)
* Antibody development
* Joint pain (arthralgia) and arthritis

Serious but less common side effects include: fluid retention, changes in glucose tolerance and the development of diabetes, serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis and angioedema), intracranial hypertension, lipoatrophy (loss of subcutaneous fat), pancreatitis, slipped capital femoral epiphyses, and reduced cortisol levels (potentially unmasking hypoadrenalism).  Any concerning side effects warrant immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Lonapegsomatropin is a pegylated (modified for longer action) form of somatropin, a human growth hormone.  It works by binding to growth hormone receptors on various cells throughout the body.  This stimulates numerous processes promoting growth, including increased cell growth in bones and muscles, enhanced protein synthesis, and changes in metabolism of fats and carbohydrates.  These actions lead to increased linear growth in children with growth hormone deficiency.

### Precautions

Lonapegsomatropin is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to lonapegsomatropin, somatropin, or any formulation component.
* Acute critical illness following major surgery or trauma.
* Acute respiratory failure.
* Closed epiphyses (growth plates).
* Active malignancy.
* Active proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy.
* Prader-Willi syndrome with severe obesity, history of sleep apnea, or severe respiratory impairment.


Precautions also include careful monitoring for fluid retention, glucose intolerance, and other side effects mentioned above.  Patients with pre-existing conditions like scoliosis should be monitored for progression.  The use in pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered, weighing the benefits against potential risks.  Interactions with other medications, such as antidiabetic agents, corticosteroids, and others, may occur.  Close monitoring and potential dosage adjustments might be necessary if taking other medications concurrently.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Lonapegsomatropin stored?** A:  Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions. It is typically stored refrigerated.

* **Q:  What if I miss a dose?** A:  Missed doses should be administered as soon as possible, provided it's within two days of the scheduled dose.  If more than two days have passed, skip the missed dose and resume the next scheduled dose.  Consult your doctor.

* **Q:  Can I use the autoinjector more than once?** A: No, the autoinjector is designed for single-use. A new autoinjector is required for each dose.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A: Long-term effects are not fully known, but regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is important to assess growth progress and detect potential side effects.

* **Q: Can I switch from another growth hormone to Lonapegsomatropin?** A: Yes, but proper transition guidance from your physician is required, especially regarding timing to avoid overlapping medications.
