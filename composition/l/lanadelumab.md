# Lanadelumab
### Generic Name
Lanadelumab

### Usage
Lanadelumab is a medication used to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients 12 years of age and older.  Hereditary angioedema is a rare genetic disorder causing swelling in various parts of the body, including the face, limbs, abdomen, and airways.  These attacks can be extremely painful and, in severe cases, life-threatening, particularly if swelling affects the airways. Lanadelumab works by preventing the attacks from occurring in the first place, offering prophylactic protection.  It's currently not indicated for treating acute attacks; other treatments are necessary for managing those.

### Dosage

**Hereditary Angioedema Prophylaxis:**

* **Adults and Children ≥12 years:** The typical starting dose is 300 mg administered subcutaneously (under the skin) every two weeks.  If the patient remains attack-free for over six months, the doctor may consider changing the dosage to 300 mg every four weeks.

**Administration:**

* Lanadelumab is given as a subcutaneous injection.
* The injection should be administered into the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.
* Rotate injection sites with each dose.  Avoid injecting into areas that are bruised, swollen, or painful.
* The vial should reach room temperature before injection (approximately 15 minutes). Gently invert to mix; do not shake.
* Once the dose is withdrawn from the vial, it must be administered within 2 hours if at room temperature or within 8 hours if refrigerated.  If refrigerated, allow the syringe to reach room temperature before use.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not currently provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Development of antibodies against the drug
* Muscle aches (myalgia)
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Injection site reactions

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Skin rash
* Diarrhea
* Increased liver enzyme levels (transaminases)
* Hypersensitivity reactions

**Serious but Less Common:**  While rare, serious hypersensitivity reactions can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, or hives.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. Consult a healthcare professional if you experience any concerning side effects.


### How it Works

Lanadelumab is a monoclonal antibody—a type of protein designed to target specific substances in the body.  In the case of HAE, it targets and inhibits plasma kallikrein, an enzyme that plays a key role in the formation of bradykinin.  Bradykinin is a substance that contributes to the swelling and inflammation characteristic of HAE attacks. By blocking the action of plasma kallikrein, Lanadelumab reduces the production of bradykinin, thus preventing HAE attacks.


### Precautions

* **Contraindication:** Lanadelumab is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.
* **Hypersensitivity:** There's an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions.  Patients should be monitored closely for any signs of allergic reactions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of Lanadelumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with a healthcare provider.  Other treatment options are generally preferred during pregnancy.  It's unknown whether the drug is excreted in breast milk.
* **Drug Interactions:** While specific drug interactions are not extensively documented, it's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.
* **Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT):** Lanadelumab may interfere with aPTT blood tests, potentially leading to inaccurate results.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Lanadelumab to start working?** A:  The onset of effect varies but is generally observed within a few weeks of starting treatment.

* **Q: Can I use Lanadelumab to treat an HAE attack that has already started?** A: No, Lanadelumab is a preventative medication, not a treatment for acute attacks.  Other medications are used to manage acute HAE episodes.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately to discuss how to proceed.

* **Q: How should I store Lanadelumab?** A: Store Lanadelumab in the refrigerator.  Allow it to reach room temperature before injection.  Refer to the specific storage instructions on the product label.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with Lanadelumab?** A:  Long-term studies are ongoing.  Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is crucial to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of treatment.
