# Losartan + Hydrochlorothiazide

**Generic Name:** Losartan Potassium/Hydrochlorothiazide

**Usage:**

Losartan Potassium/Hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It's a combination drug, meaning it contains two active ingredients working together:

* **Losartan Potassium:** An angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).  It works by relaxing blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood.
* **Hydrochlorothiazide:** A thiazide diuretic (water pill). It helps your body get rid of excess salt and water, which lowers blood volume and blood pressure.

This combination is often prescribed when treating high blood pressure that isn't adequately controlled with either losartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Dry cough (less common than with ACE inhibitors)
* Muscle cramps
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Increased urination


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema â€“ seek immediate medical attention)
* High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Kidney problems
* Liver problems
* Allergic reactions


**How it Works:**

Losartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels.  By blocking angiotensin II, losartan helps relax and widen the blood vessels, reducing blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the kidneys, thus reducing blood volume and subsequently blood pressure.  Together, they provide a more potent and effective blood pressure-lowering effect than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Losartan/Hydrochlorothiazide?**  Alcohol can lower blood pressure, so combining it with this medication may increase the risk of low blood pressure (hypotension).  It's best to limit or avoid alcohol while taking this medication.

* **Can I take Losartan/Hydrochlorothiazide if I'm pregnant?** No.  This medication is contraindicated in pregnancy as it can cause serious harm to the developing fetus.  Discuss alternative blood pressure medications with your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.

* **What are the potential drug interactions?**  Many medications can interact with Losartan/Hydrochlorothiazide.  It is crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some common interactions involve potassium supplements, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and lithium.

* **Should I avoid certain foods while taking this medication?**  A diet high in potassium should be avoided, particularly if you have kidney problems.  Your doctor may advise you to limit potassium-rich foods like bananas, oranges, and potatoes.

* **When should I contact my doctor?** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects, such as swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, or significant changes in urination. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and potassium levels is often necessary.
