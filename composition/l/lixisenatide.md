# Lixisenatide
### Generic Name
Lixisenatide

### Usage
Lixisenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. Its primary use is as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's not used for type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.  While it can be used as an alternative monotherapy in select patients (those where lifestyle changes and metformin are unsuccessful or contraindicated), it's important to note that it doesn't improve cardiovascular outcomes.

### Dosage
**Adults (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus):** Lixisenatide is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  The initial dose is 10 mcg once daily for 14 days.  On day 15, the dose is increased to 20 mcg once daily, which is the maintenance dose.  It should be injected at least one hour before the first meal of the day, preferably the same meal each day.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of lixisenatide in children under 18 have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are specifically recommended for hepatic impairment. For renal impairment, careful monitoring is crucial.  If the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 30-89 mL/min/1.73 m², no adjustment is needed, but watch for increased gastrointestinal side effects.  For eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m², use is not recommended, due to increased exposure and risk of side effects.  If the eGFR is below 15 mL/min/1.73 m², lixisenatide should not be used.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (≥10%):**

* Gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea)
* Antibody development

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Dyspepsia
* Abdominal distension
* Upper abdominal pain
* Injection site reactions

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Acute renal injury
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Pancreatitis (acute, chronic, and edematous)
* Renal insufficiency


If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Lixisenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist. It works by mimicking the effects of GLP-1, a natural hormone that helps regulate blood sugar.  Specifically, it increases glucose-dependent insulin release (meaning insulin release only when blood sugar is high), decreases glucagon secretion (a hormone that raises blood sugar), and slows down gastric emptying.  These actions all contribute to better blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  Lixisenatide is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to lixisenatide or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used with sulfonylureas or basal insulin.
* Increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
* Increased risk of acute pancreatitis.
* Risk of anaphylaxis and serious hypersensitivity reactions.
* Risk of gallbladder disease.
* Risk of acute kidney injury.
* Development of anti-lixisenatide antibodies.
* No demonstrated benefit on macrovascular outcomes.
* Risk of dehydration.
* Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, underweight or malnourished patients, alcoholics, debilitated or elderly patients, and when used with other medications (see interactions).

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Lixisenatide is not recommended during pregnancy. Other agents are preferred for managing diabetes during pregnancy.  The safety of lixisenatide in breastfeeding is unknown.

**Drug Interactions:** Lixisenatide can interact with many medications, including those for diabetes, oral contraceptives, and others. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with any medications you are currently taking.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Lixisenatide?** A: Store the pen in its original packaging to protect it from light. Discard the pen 14 days after first use.
* **Q: Can I share my Lixisenatide pen?** A: No, sharing the pen carries a risk of transmitting bloodborne pathogens.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose within one hour before your next meal. If it's almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule.
* **Q: What are the signs of hypoglycemia?** A: Symptoms include sweating, shakiness, dizziness, confusion, and rapid heartbeat.
* **Q: When should I contact my doctor?** A: Contact your doctor if you experience any side effects, especially severe ones such as pancreatitis symptoms (severe abdominal pain), allergic reactions, or significant changes in kidney function.  Also seek advice if you experience persistent or worsening gastrointestinal symptoms.
