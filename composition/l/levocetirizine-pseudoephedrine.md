# Levocetirizine + Pseudoephedrine

**Generic Name:** Levocetirizine and Pseudoephedrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of allergies and the common cold.  Levocetirizine is an antihistamine that reduces sneezing, runny nose, itchy/watery eyes, and hives. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving nasal congestion.  It's often used for symptoms like stuffy nose and sinus pressure.  The combination is effective because it tackles both the itchy/watery symptoms and the stuffiness associated with allergies and colds.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects include:

* **Dry mouth:**  A very frequent side effect of both components.
* **Drowsiness:**  More likely with levocetirizine.
* **Headache:** Can be caused by either component.
* **Nausea:** Less common.
* **Dizziness:**  Relatively uncommon, but possible.
* **Insomnia:** More likely with pseudoephedrine, especially if taken later in the day.
* **Increased heart rate:** More likely with pseudoephedrine, particularly in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Increased blood pressure:**  More likely with pseudoephedrine.
* **Anxiety:**  Possible with pseudoephedrine.
* **Constipation:** Less common.

**Serious side effects are rare but should be reported to a doctor immediately.** These could include allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), fast or irregular heartbeat, severe dizziness, or changes in vision.


**How it Works:**

* **Levocetirizine:** This is a selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist. Histamine is a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, causing symptoms like itching, sneezing, and runny nose. Levocetirizine blocks histamine from binding to its receptors, thereby preventing these symptoms.

* **Pseudoephedrine:** This is a sympathomimetic amine. It works by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages. This reduces swelling and congestion, making breathing easier.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Alcohol can enhance the sedative effects of levocetirizine and should be avoided or consumed in moderation.  It can also interact negatively with pseudoephedrine, exacerbating potential side effects like increased blood pressure and heart rate.

* **Can I take this medication while pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Consult your doctor before taking this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  The safety of this combination in these situations hasn't been fully established.

* **How long can I take this medication?**  Do not take this medication for longer than recommended by your doctor or as indicated on the packaging.  Prolonged use can lead to decreased effectiveness.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Who should not take this medication?** Individuals with certain medical conditions, such as severe heart disease, high blood pressure, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, or prostate problems, should avoid this medication or consult their doctor before taking it. It should also be avoided by people with a history of allergic reactions to either levocetirizine or pseudoephedrine.  People taking MAO inhibitors should also avoid pseudoephedrine.
