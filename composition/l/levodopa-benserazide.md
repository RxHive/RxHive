# Levodopa + Benserazide
### Generic Name
Levodopa + Benserazide

### Usage
Levodopa + Benserazide is primarily used to treat Parkinson's disease, a neurological disorder affecting movement.  It's a combination medication where levodopa is the main active ingredient, replenishing dopamine levels in the brain that are depleted in Parkinson's. Benserazide helps to increase the amount of levodopa that reaches the brain by preventing its breakdown in the body. This combination is effective in managing symptoms like tremors, rigidity, slow movement (bradykinesia), and postural instability.  It's important to note that this combination is not used for drug-induced Parkinsonism.


### Dosage

Dosage of Levodopa + Benserazide is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's age, weight, response to treatment, and the presence of other medical conditions. It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescription precisely.

**Adults:**

* **Parkinson's Disease (initiation):**  The starting dose is typically low and gradually increased over several weeks to find the optimal therapeutic effect while minimizing side effects.  The initial dose might be Levodopa 50 mg/Benserazide 12.5 mg several times a day,  or different combinations depending on prior medication and individual need.  The total daily dose is adjusted based on response and tolerance, typically reaching 400-800mg of Levodopa per day. The total daily dose of Levodopa should generally not exceed 1000-1200 mg/day during the first year of therapy. After one year, the maximum recommended daily dose is 600 mg/day. Different forms (immediate-release tablets or capsules, dispersible tablets, and controlled-release formulations) may be used with varying administration schedules as directed by the physician.

* **Switching from other Levodopa medications:** If a patient is switching from another Levodopa medication, the physician will carefully titrate the dose to ensure a smooth transition and minimize potential adverse reactions.

* **Dosage adjustments:** Dosage may need adjustments based on individual response and the development of side effects. In case of dyskinesias (uncontrolled movements), a dose reduction may be necessary.  The physician will tailor the medication regimen to meet individual patient needs and should be consulted for any dose changes.


**Children:** The use of Levodopa + Benserazide is not recommended in children.

**Specific instructions for taking the different forms of the medication will be provided by your doctor or pharmacist.**


### Side Effects

* Suicidal thoughts
* Severe allergic reactions

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the more serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for movement control. In Parkinson's disease, dopamine production is significantly reduced. Levodopa is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and be converted into dopamine in the brain, thus alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.  Benserazide is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor which prevents the premature conversion of levodopa into dopamine outside of the brain. This ensures that more levodopa reaches the brain, improving its effectiveness.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Levodopa + Benserazide should not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to levodopa or benserazide, those taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), patients with severe liver or kidney disease, uncontrolled glaucoma,  or those with pheochromocytoma or malignant melanoma.  It is also contraindicated in pregnant women and women of childbearing age who are not using reliable contraception.


* **Drug Interactions:**  Levodopa + Benserazide can interact with many other medications, including MAOIs, some antidepressants (tricyclics), antipsychotics, certain antihypertensives, and iron supplements.  Consult your doctor about all medications and supplements you are currently taking.  The combined use of Levodopa + Benserazide with Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) should be avoided.


* **Warnings:** Patients with a history of heart problems, ulcers, diabetes, or psychiatric conditions should be closely monitored while on this medication.  The drug may cause drowsiness, affecting the ability to drive or operate machinery.  Sudden discontinuation of this medication should be avoided due to possible withdrawal effects.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** This medication should not be used during pregnancy or by women who are breastfeeding.
