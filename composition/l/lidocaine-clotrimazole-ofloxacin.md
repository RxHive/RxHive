# Lidocaine + Clotrimazole + Ofloxacin

**Generic Name:** Lidocaine + Clotrimazole + Ofloxacin

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat various skin infections characterized by pain, fungal infection, and bacterial infection.  It's often prescribed for conditions like:

* **Infected cuts and abrasions:** Where the injury has become infected with bacteria and/or fungi.
* **Infected eczema or dermatitis:**  To treat secondary bacterial and fungal infections that can complicate these skin conditions.
* **Other minor skin infections:**  As directed by a physician for specific skin infections presenting with these three types of pathogens.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects may include:

* **Burning or stinging sensation:** At the application site.
* **Itching:** At the application site.
* **Redness:** At the application site.
* **Skin rash:**  Allergic reactions are possible.
* **Dryness or peeling:** Of the skin.

More serious side effects are less common but should be reported immediately to a doctor:

* **Allergic reactions:**  These can manifest as swelling, hives, difficulty breathing, or other symptoms.
* **Systemic absorption:** Although topical, absorption into the bloodstream is possible, especially with large areas of application or damaged skin. This can lead to systemic side effects of lidocaine, clotrimazole, or ofloxacin.


**How it Works:** This triple combination works by combining the actions of three different active ingredients:

* **Lidocaine:** A local anesthetic that numbs the affected area, reducing pain and discomfort.
* **Clotrimazole:** An antifungal agent that kills or inhibits the growth of fungi, treating the fungal component of the infection.
* **Ofloxacin:** An antibacterial agent that kills or inhibits the growth of bacteria, treating the bacterial component of the infection.

By combining these three, the medication targets multiple types of pathogens simultaneously, offering a comprehensive approach to treating mixed infections.
