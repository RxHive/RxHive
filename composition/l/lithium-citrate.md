# Lithium Citrate
### Generic Name
Lithium Citrate

### Usage
Lithium citrate's primary use is in treating manic episodes associated with Bipolar Disorder.  It's crucial to understand that it addresses the *manic* phase, characterized by elevated mood, inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, and impulsive behavior. While not its primary indication, lithium citrate is sometimes used off-label in treating bipolar depression, general depression, or as an augmentation strategy to enhance the effects of other antidepressants.  However, its off-label uses should only be considered under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on individual response and serum lithium levels.  The goal is to achieve therapeutic blood levels, typically between 0.6 and 1.2 mEq/L, although this can be higher in some cases (but should not exceed 1.5 mEq/L).  

* **Immediate-release:** 900-2400 mg/day, divided into doses every 6-8 hours.
* **Extended-release:** 900-1800 mg/day, divided into doses every 12 hours.

Lower starting doses may be used to minimize side effects.  Regular blood tests to monitor serum lithium levels are essential, typically twice weekly until levels stabilize, and then less frequently thereafter.

**Pediatric Dosage (Off-label):**  Use in children under 12 is generally not recommended, and use in those 12 and older is considered off-label. The dosage is similar to that of adults (900-2400 mg/day immediate-release, divided q6-8hr or 900-1800 mg/day extended-release, divided q12hr), but careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is paramount due to the developing systems in children and adolescents.  A physician specializing in pediatric psychiatry should guide treatment.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are crucial based on renal function. Reduced doses are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function.  The specific adjustments depend on the creatinine clearance (CrCl) rate. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) need adjusted dosages given the significant impact kidney function has on lithium clearance. The prescribing physician should make these adjustments based on the patientâ€™s individual needs and renal function tests.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count)
* Polyuria (increased urination)
* Polydipsia (increased thirst)
* Dry mouth
* Hand tremor
* Confusion
* Decreased memory
* Headache
* Muscle weakness
* ECG changes
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
* Hyperreflexia (overactive reflexes)
* Muscle twitching
* Vertigo

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include extrapyramidal symptoms, goiter, hypothyroidism, acne, hair thinning, coma, lethargy, seizures, and renal toxicity.  Any significant or concerning side effects warrant immediate consultation with a healthcare professional.


### How it Works

The exact mechanism by which lithium citrate stabilizes mood in bipolar disorder is not fully understood.  However, it's believed to influence various processes within the brain: it may alter cation transport across cell membranes in nerve and muscle cells, affect the reuptake of neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, and interfere with second messenger systems.  Recent research also suggests lithium may offer neuroprotective effects by influencing glutamate clearance, apoptotic activity, and the expression of neurotrophic factors.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Lithium citrate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to lithium, severe cardiovascular or renal disease, severe debilitation, dehydration, sodium depletion, and those concurrently using certain diuretics.
* **Interactions:**  Lithium can interact with several medications, including diuretics, NSAIDs, and certain antipsychotics (especially haloperidol).  Concomitant use requires careful monitoring of lithium levels to avoid toxicity.  Neuromuscular blocking agents may also have their effects prolonged by lithium.
* **Warnings:**  Lithium can cause various adverse effects, including renal toxicity, hypothyroidism, and potentially serious cardiovascular issues.  Regular monitoring of renal function, thyroid function, and serum lithium levels are crucial.  Patients with pre-existing thyroid or kidney problems require extra caution.  Use in pregnancy (Category D) and breastfeeding is generally discouraged due to potential harm to the fetus and infant.  Patients should be aware of the risk of suicide and the importance of close monitoring, especially during the initiation of treatment.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take lithium citrate with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking. Lithium can interact with many drugs, requiring dose adjustments or close monitoring.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The therapeutic effects of lithium citrate may not be fully evident for several weeks, often requiring several adjustments to the dosage to achieve optimal therapeutic serum levels.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A:  Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.
* **Q: How should I store lithium citrate?** A: Store as directed on the label, usually at room temperature away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Can I stop taking lithium citrate suddenly?** A: No. Stopping lithium abruptly can lead to serious withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.  Withdrawal is usually a gradual process guided by your physician.
