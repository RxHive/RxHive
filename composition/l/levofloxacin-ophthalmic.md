# Levofloxacin (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Levofloxacin (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Levofloxacin ophthalmic solution is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the eye.  Its primary use is in treating bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye), a common eye infection causing redness, irritation, and discharge. It's also indicated for the treatment of corneal ulcers, which are more serious infections affecting the cornea (the clear front part of the eye) and potentially leading to vision impairment if left untreated.  The ophthalmic formulation is specifically designed for topical application to the eye, ensuring localized treatment and minimizing systemic absorption.

### Dosage

**Bacterial Conjunctivitis (0.5% solution):**

* **Adults:** Days 1-2: Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 2 hours while awake (up to 8 times daily). Days 3-7: Instill 1-2 drops every 4 hours while awake (up to 4 times daily).
* **Children (6 years and older):** Dosage is the same as for adults.  Use in children younger than 6 years old hasn't been established.

**Corneal Ulcer (1.5% solution):**

* **Adults:** Days 1-3: Instill 1-2 drops every 30 minutes to 2 hours while awake, and approximately 4 and 6 hours after bedtime. From day 4 onwards, until treatment completion: Instill 1-2 drops every 1-4 hours while awake.
* **Children:**  The use of this strength in children hasn't been established.


**Important Administration Notes:** Avoid touching the tip of the dropper to any surface, including the eye. After instilling the drops, gently apply pressure to the inner corner of your eye (near the nose) for 1-2 minutes to minimize systemic absorption.  Contact lenses should be removed before application and reinserted only after at least 15 minutes.


### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Burning sensation in the eye
* Eye pain
* Foreign body sensation in the eye
* Photophobia (light sensitivity)
* Vision changes
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Fever

**Less Common (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Dry eye syndrome
* Eyelid swelling (edema)
* Eye itching (pruritus)
* Allergic reactions (including hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxisâ€”seek immediate medical attention if this occurs)

If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.


### How it Works

Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that works by inhibiting two bacterial enzymes essential for DNA replication: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.  By blocking these enzymes, levofloxacin prevents bacterial cells from reproducing and repairing their DNA, ultimately leading to their death. This targeted action effectively combats bacterial infections in the eye.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Levofloxacin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known allergies to levofloxacin, other quinolones (a class of antibiotics), or any component of the formulation.  A history of serious allergic reactions to other quinolones significantly increases the risk of a similar reaction with levofloxacin.
* **Hypersensitivity:** There is an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.  Discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, or hives.
* **Superinfection:**  Prolonged use can increase the risk of superinfection (a secondary infection caused by a different organism).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Levofloxacin is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been fully established.  Excretion into breast milk is unknown; however, systemic absorption from ophthalmic drops is low. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Consult your doctor.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are typically not necessary for individuals with liver or kidney problems due to the low systemic absorption of the ophthalmic formulation. However, it's crucial to consult your doctor.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for levofloxacin ophthalmic to work?**  A: Improvement should be noticed within a few days, but complete resolution may take a week or longer, depending on the severity of the infection.  Continue using the medication as directed, even if you feel better.
* **Q: Can I wear contact lenses while using levofloxacin ophthalmic?** A:  No, it's recommended to avoid wearing contact lenses during treatment to allow the medication to work effectively and to minimize the risk of infection.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store levofloxacin ophthalmic?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q:  Can I use this medication for other types of eye infections?** A:  No. Levofloxacin ophthalmic is only indicated for bacterial infections.  It won't be effective against viral or fungal eye infections.  Always consult an ophthalmologist for diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
