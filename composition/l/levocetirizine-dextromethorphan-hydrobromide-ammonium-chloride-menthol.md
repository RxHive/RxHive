# Levocetirizine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Ammonium Chloride + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Levocetirizine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Ammonium Chloride + Menthol

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms of the common cold or upper respiratory allergies.  It combines the actions of several ingredients to target different symptoms:

* **Levocetirizine:** An antihistamine that reduces sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes associated with allergies.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive) that reduces the urge to cough.
* **Ammonium Chloride:** An expectorant that helps to thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Menthol:** A topical anesthetic and counterirritant that provides a cooling sensation and may help relieve congestion.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects may include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a common side effect of levocetirizine and dextromethorphan. Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth:**  A common side effect of antihistamines and some cough suppressants.
* **Nausea:** Especially with higher doses.
* **Headache:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Constipation:**
* **Stomach upset:**
* **Allergic reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions, such as skin rash, hives, or difficulty breathing, are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.

**How it Works:**

* **Levocetirizine:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This reduces allergic symptoms.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
* **Ammonium Chloride:** Increases the fluid content of respiratory secretions, making them less viscous and easier to expel.
* **Menthol:** Creates a cooling sensation on the skin and mucous membranes, potentially providing temporary relief from congestion.
