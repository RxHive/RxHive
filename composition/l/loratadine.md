# Loratadine
### Generic Name
Loratadine

### Usage

Loratadine is a non-drowsy antihistamine primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives).  Seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose and eyes, and nasal congestion.  Chronic idiopathic urticaria involves the development of itchy welts (hives) on the skin.  While not its primary indication, Loratadine may also be used as an adjunct treatment for allergic asthma, although this is considered off-label use.

### Dosage

**Adults (12 years and older):** The usual adult dose for seasonal allergic rhinitis and urticaria is 10 mg once daily.  Some formulations might be available as 5 mg twice daily.  For off-label use in allergic asthma, doses between 10-20mg once daily may be used for up to 8 weeks under medical supervision.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.


**Children (2 to 11 years):** Dosage for children varies significantly depending on their age and the specific formulation.  Always check the product labeling for precise instructions, but generally:

* **Children aged 2 to 5 years:** A typical dose is 5 mg once daily.
* **Children aged 6 to 11 years:** A typical dose is either 5 mg twice daily or 10 mg once daily.

Different formulations (tablets, chewable tablets, oral solutions, etc.) have different strengths, so you must carefully follow the prescribing information.  Never exceed the recommended dose.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Patients with liver or kidney problems may require dosage adjustments.  Older adults may also need lower doses to minimize side effects. Consult a doctor before adjusting the dosage.

### Side Effects

Loratadine is generally well-tolerated, but some common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Drowsiness (less common than with older antihistamines)
* Dry mouth
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Dizziness

Serious side effects are rare, but it is important to contact your doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.


### How it Works

Loratadine is a selective peripheral histamine H1-receptor antagonist.  This means it works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine is responsible for many allergy symptoms like itching, sneezing, and inflammation. By blocking histamine's effects, Loratadine helps to relieve these symptoms.  It primarily acts in the peripheral tissues and doesn't significantly cross the blood-brain barrier, minimizing the risk of drowsiness compared to older antihistamines.

### Precautions

* **Allergy:**  Individuals with a known allergy to Loratadine or similar medications (e.g., desloratadine) should avoid using it.
* **Liver/Kidney Disease:**  Dosage adjustments are usually necessary for people with liver or kidney impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Loratadine is considered relatively safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but using the lowest effective dose is recommended. Consult your doctor.
* **Drug Interactions:** Loratadine's metabolism can be affected by certain medications, including some antifungals and antibiotics. Discuss any other medications you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist before starting Loratadine.
* **Other Conditions:**  If you have other medical conditions or are taking other medications, inform your doctor before starting Loratadine.
