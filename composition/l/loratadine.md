# Loratadine

**Generic Name:** Loratadine

**Usage:**

Loratadine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies.  These symptoms include:

* Sneezing
* Runny nose
* Itchy, watery eyes
* Itchy nose and throat
* Hives (urticaria)

It's also used to treat chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives that appear and disappear unpredictably).  It's available over-the-counter (OTC) in many countries for allergy relief and by prescription for some uses.  Always follow the dosage instructions on the label or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Side Effects:**

Loratadine is generally well-tolerated, but some people may experience side effects, including:

* **Common (affecting 1-10% of users):**  Headache, drowsiness, dry mouth, fatigue.  These are typically mild and temporary.
* **Less Common (affecting less than 1% of users):** Dizziness, nausea, stomach pain, insomnia, nervousness, increased appetite.
* **Rare (affecting less than 1% of users):**  Serious allergic reactions (e.g., rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), palpitations, fast heartbeat.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.

The likelihood and severity of side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.

**How it Works:**

Loratadine is a peripherally acting histamine H1-receptor antagonist.  This means it works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine is responsible for many allergy symptoms. By blocking its action at the histamine receptors, loratadine reduces these symptoms without significantly crossing the blood-brain barrier, which minimizes the risk of central nervous system side effects like drowsiness compared to older antihistamines.

**FAQs:**

* **Is loratadine safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?**  While generally considered safe, it's best to consult your doctor before taking loratadine if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Can I take loratadine with other medications?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking loratadine?** While not directly contraindicated, combining loratadine with alcohol may increase the risk of drowsiness.  Avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking this medication.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **Can I take loratadine long-term?**  Loratadine can be taken long-term for the management of chronic allergic conditions, as directed by your doctor.  However, regular review of your condition is essential.
* **What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?**  Stop taking loratadine immediately and seek medical attention if you experience any signs of a serious allergic reaction, such as swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, difficulty breathing, or hives.
