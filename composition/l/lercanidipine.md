# Lercanidipine
### Generic Name
Lercanidipine

### Usage
Lercanidipine is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It works by relaxing blood vessels, which lowers the pressure against which the heart must pump blood. This helps to reduce the strain on the cardiovascular system. While its primary use is for hypertension, it's not typically used to treat other cardiovascular conditions directly.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The usual starting dose for hypertension is 10 mg once daily.  This dose may be increased to 20 mg once daily after two weeks if needed, based on blood pressure response and tolerability. The maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg. Lercanidipine is administered orally in tablet form.  It's crucial to take Lercanidipine at least 15 minutes before a meal, on an empty stomach, for optimal absorption.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Lercanidipine in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Caution is advised in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment.  Dosage adjustment may be necessary, but specific guidelines aren't provided in the manufacturer's labeling. Lercanidipine is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is typically recommended by the manufacturer for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) of â‰¥30 mL/min; however, caution should be exercised when increasing the dosage. Lercanidipine is contraindicated in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min and in those undergoing dialysis.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Flushing
* Palpitations
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Increased serum gamma-glutamyl transferase level (a liver enzyme)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Abdominal pain
* Allergic dermatitis
* Angina pectoris (chest pain)
* Cardiac failure
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Syncope (fainting)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the less common ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Lercanidipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.  It works by preventing calcium ions from entering the smooth muscle cells in the walls of blood vessels. This relaxation of the blood vessels leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing peripheral vascular resistance and subsequently lowering blood pressure.  Lercanidipine's prolonged effect is due to its high membrane-partition coefficient, meaning it remains in the body's tissues for a longer time.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Lercanidipine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Lercanidipine or other dihydropyridines, untreated congestive heart failure, recent myocardial infarction (within one month), unstable angina, left ventricular outflow obstruction (aortic stenosis), severe hepatic or renal impairment, those undergoing dialysis, and pregnant or breastfeeding women (unless effective contraception is used).  It should also be avoided in patients concurrently using strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, cyclosporine, grapefruit, or grapefruit juice.
* **Interactions:** Lercanidipine can interact with several medications.  CYP3A4 inducers can decrease its effectiveness, while CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase its concentration in the blood.  Simultaneous use with cyclosporine may increase serum concentrations of both drugs.  Alcohol may potentiate the vasodilatory effects of Lercanidipine. The use of beta-blockers such as propranolol or metoprolol may reduce the bioavailability of Lercanidipine.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with ischemic heart disease, mild-to-moderate hepatic or renal impairment, sick sinus syndrome (without a pacemaker), porphyria, myasthenia-like neuromuscular disease, cardiogenic shock, systolic heart failure, or persistent dry cough.  Increased risk of angina or myocardial infarction exists in certain patient populations.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Lercanidipine?** A: No, it's best to avoid alcohol consumption while taking Lercanidipine, as it can increase the risk of low blood pressure and other side effects.

* **Q: Can I eat grapefruit while taking Lercanidipine?** A: No, grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided as they can significantly increase Lercanidipine levels in your blood.

* **Q: How should I store Lercanidipine?** A: Store Lercanidipine at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.  Refer to the packaging instructions for specific details.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Lercanidipine abruptly?** A: No, you should never stop taking Lercanidipine abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.
