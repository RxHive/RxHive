# Lercanidipine

**Generic Name:** Lercanidipine

**Usage:** Lercanidipine is a calcium channel blocker used to treat **hypertension (high blood pressure)**.  It's prescribed to lower blood pressure, which helps reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular complications like stroke and heart attack.  It may be used alone or in combination with other blood pressure medications.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, lercanidipine can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** This is a relatively frequent side effect.
* **Facial flushing:** A reddening of the face.
* **Peripheral edema (swelling):** Swelling in the ankles, feet, and legs.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or faint.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Palpitations:** Feeling a rapid or irregular heartbeat.

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat):** This is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  Can cause dizziness or fainting.
* **Liver problems:**  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) and abdominal pain.


**How it Works:** Lercanidipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.  It works by relaxing and widening blood vessels.  Calcium ions play a crucial role in the constriction of blood vessels.  By blocking the entry of calcium ions into the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, lercanidipine prevents them from contracting, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). This reduced vascular resistance lowers blood pressure.  It primarily affects arterioles (small arteries), resulting in a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking lercanidipine?** A:  Alcohol can lower blood pressure, so combining it with lercanidipine may increase the risk of hypotension (low blood pressure). It's best to avoid excessive alcohol consumption while taking this medication or to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **Q: Can I take lercanidipine with grapefruit juice?** A: Grapefruit juice can interact with lercanidipine and increase its concentration in the body, potentially leading to increased side effects.  Avoid grapefruit juice while taking this medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking lercanidipine suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop taking lercanidipine suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Your doctor will gradually reduce your dose if you need to discontinue the medication.

* **Q:  Is lercanidipine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A: The safety of lercanidipine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your doctor to discuss the risks and benefits before taking this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
