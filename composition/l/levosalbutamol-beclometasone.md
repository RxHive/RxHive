# Levosalbutamol + Beclometasone

**Generic Name:** Levosalbutamol + Beclometasone Dipropionate

**Usage:**

This combination inhaler is used to prevent and treat symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Levosalbutamol, a short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA), quickly relaxes the muscles around the airways, making breathing easier. Beclometasone dipropionate, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation in the airways, preventing the symptoms from recurring.  It's typically used for patients who need both a quick-relief medication and a preventative medication for long-term control of their respiratory condition.  The specific dosage and frequency will be determined by a doctor based on the individual's needs.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Levosalbutamol-related:** Tremors, headache, palpitations, muscle cramps, nervousness, dizziness.
* **Beclometasone-related:**  Oral thrush (candidiasis), hoarseness, throat irritation, cough, headache.  Long-term use may rarely lead to more serious side effects like glaucoma, cataracts, osteoporosis, or slowing of child growth (if used in children).

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention.  These include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing)
* Increased blood sugar levels
* High blood pressure


**How it Works:**

* **Levosalbutamol:**  This medication works by binding to beta-2 receptors in the lungs. This leads to the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles, widening the airways and making breathing easier.  It provides quick relief from symptoms like wheezing and shortness of breath.

* **Beclometasone Dipropionate:** This corticosteroid reduces inflammation in the airways by suppressing the activity of inflammatory cells. By reducing inflammation, it prevents the airways from narrowing and helps prevent asthma attacks or COPD exacerbations.  The effect is not immediate, requiring regular use for long-term benefits.
