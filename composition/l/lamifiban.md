# Lamifiban
### Generic Name
Lamifiban

### Usage
Lamifiban is a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist.  While it was under clinical investigation for the treatment and prevention of acute coronary syndromes (ACS),  clinical trials did not demonstrate significant improvements in patient outcomes compared to standard treatments. Therefore, it's not currently approved for widespread medical use.  Its primary intended use was to inhibit platelet aggregation and thrombus (blood clot) formation in patients experiencing or at high risk of ACS.  It's crucial to understand that Lamifiban is not currently available for prescription.

### Dosage
Since Lamifiban never received market approval, there are no established dosage recommendations for adults or children.  Information regarding administration routes (e.g., intravenous injection) and specific dosing regimens is unavailable for public use.

### Side Effects
The most frequently reported adverse event during clinical trials of Lamifiban was bleeding. This ranged from minor bleeding to more serious hemorrhagic complications.  Other potential side effects were not extensively documented due to the drug's failure to progress to market approval.  It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for any concerns about side effects from medication.

### How it Works
Lamifiban works by selectively binding to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on the surface of platelets.  This receptor is crucial for platelet aggregation (clumping together), a critical step in blood clot formation. By blocking this receptor, Lamifiban prevents fibrinogen (a clotting protein) from binding to platelets, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation and subsequently reducing thrombus formation.

### Precautions
Because Lamifiban did not complete clinical trials successfully and was not approved for market, detailed precautions are not readily available. However, given its mechanism of action,  a major concern would have been the risk of bleeding, especially in individuals with bleeding disorders or those already on anticoagulant medications.  Pregnant women and individuals with compromised kidney or liver function would likely have required special caution, though specific guidelines were never established.
