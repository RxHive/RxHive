# Lidocaine + Tannic Acid
### Generic Name
Lidocaine + Tannic Acid

### Usage

Lidocaine and Tannic Acid combination is primarily used as a topical anesthetic and astringent for the temporary relief of pain and discomfort associated with minor burns, wounds, and other skin irritations.  Lidocaine, a local anesthetic, numbs the affected area, while tannic acid, an astringent, helps to constrict blood vessels, reducing inflammation and bleeding. This combination is particularly effective for providing temporary pain relief while also promoting healing in minor skin injuries.  It's crucial to remember that this combination is intended for superficial wounds and minor burns only; it's not suitable for deep or severe injuries requiring professional medical attention.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will vary significantly depending on the specific product formulation (cream, ointment, spray, etc.) and the affected area.  Always follow the instructions provided on the product packaging carefully.  Generally, a thin layer of the cream or ointment is applied directly to the affected area as needed for pain relief, not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose.  Specific application frequency is usually detailed in the product literature.  

**There is no standard IV or oral dosage for a Lidocaine + Tannic Acid combination.**  This medication is exclusively for topical application.  Oral or intravenous administration of this combination is not recommended and is potentially dangerous.  Use only as directed by a healthcare professional or the product labeling.  Do not use on children under the age of 2 without specific instructions from a pediatrician.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Mild burning or stinging sensation at the application site, temporary redness, skin irritation.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), excessive dryness of the skin, prolonged numbness.
* **Note:** If any adverse reaction occurs, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Lidocaine works by temporarily blocking nerve impulses in the affected area, preventing pain signals from reaching the brain.  This leads to temporary numbness and pain relief. Tannic acid acts as an astringent, meaning it causes the contraction of tissues and blood vessels.  This action helps to reduce swelling, bleeding, and inflammation, thereby promoting healing. The combined effect provides both pain relief and assistance in the healing process of minor skin injuries.
