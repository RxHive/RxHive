# Lefamulin
### Generic Name
Lefamulin

### Usage
Lefamulin is a pleuromutilin antibiotic primarily used to treat community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults caused by susceptible bacteria.  It's considered an alternative treatment option, particularly for patients who may not tolerate or respond well to other antibiotics.  Currently, its use is limited to adult patients; safety and efficacy haven't been established in children.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  Dosage varies depending on the route of administration (intravenous or oral) and the presence of liver impairment.

* **Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults without structural lung disease (alternative agent):**
    * **Intravenous (IV):** 150 mg infused over 60 minutes every 12 hours for 5-7 days.
    * **Oral:** 600 mg every 12 hours for 5 days.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For IV administration, patients with mild-to-moderate impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B) require no dosage adjustment.  Those with severe impairment (Child-Pugh class C) should receive 150 mg every 24 hours.  Oral administration is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Lefamulin in children have not been established.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Diarrhea

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Insomnia, headache, anxiety, drowsiness
* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation, palpitations, QT prolongation (a serious heart rhythm abnormality)
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, *Clostridioides difficile*-associated diarrhea (C. diff), constipation, dyspepsia, epigastric discomfort, gastritis, oropharyngeal candidiasis
* Endocrine and metabolic: Hypokalemia (low potassium), increased serum gamma-glutamyl transferase levels
* Genitourinary: Urinary retention, vulvovaginal candidiasis
* Hematologic: Anemia, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Hepatic: Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, ALP)
* Local (IV): Infusion-site pain, injection-site phlebitis, injection-site reaction
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Increased creatine phosphokinase levels


**Serious Side Effects (Less Common):**  QT prolongation is a serious potential side effect that requires monitoring, especially in patients with risk factors.  *Clostridioides difficile* infection is a potentially life-threatening complication.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious or concerning side effects.


### How it Works

Lefamulin is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor.  It works by binding to the bacterial ribosome's 50S subunit, specifically within the peptidyl transferase center. This binding interferes with the process of protein synthesis, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.  Its unique binding mechanism contributes to its activity against various bacterial species.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Lefamulin is contraindicated in individuals with a hypersensitivity to Lefamulin, other pleuromutilins, or any formulation component.  It should not be used concurrently with CYP3A4 substrates that prolong the QT interval (e.g., pimozide).
* **Warnings:** Lefamulin can prolong the QT interval, increasing the risk of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with risk factors for QT prolongation should be monitored closely.  The risk of *Clostridioides difficile* infection should be considered, particularly in patients receiving antibiotics.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Lefamulin interacts with numerous other medications, both increasing and decreasing their effectiveness.  Consult a healthcare provider about potential interactions with other drugs you are taking.  CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors can significantly alter Lefamulin levels.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Lefamulin may cause fetal harm.  It's essential to discuss pregnancy status with your healthcare provider before starting treatment. Effective contraception should be used during and for two days after therapy.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for two days after the last dose.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Lefamulin with food?** A: No. Take oral Lefamulin at least 1 hour before a meal or 2 hours after a meal.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If it is less than 8 hours until your next dose, skip the missed dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store Lefamulin?** A: Store Lefamulin as directed on the product label.
* **Q: Are there any specific warnings for older adults?** A: Older adults may be at increased risk for certain side effects, such as QT prolongation.  Close monitoring is recommended.
* **Q: Is Lefamulin safe for pregnant women?** A: No. Lefamulin is not recommended during pregnancy due to potential risks to the developing fetus. Discuss alternative treatment options with your doctor.
