# Levocloperastine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate
### Generic Name
Levocloperastine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

### Usage

Levocloperastine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate is a combination medication used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, allergies, and the flu.  It works by targeting two different aspects of these conditions:

* **Levocloperastine:** This is an antihistamine that helps reduce symptoms caused by histamine release, such as sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and watery eyes. Histamine is a chemical released by the body in response to allergens or irritants.  By blocking histamine's effects, levocloperastine provides relief from these allergic symptoms.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is also an antihistamine, but it possesses additional anticholinergic properties. This means it can also help dry up runny noses and reduce excessive nasal secretions, offering further relief from cold and allergy symptoms.  It's particularly effective in managing the nasal congestion often associated with these conditions.

Therefore, this combination medication provides broader relief from a wider range of cold and allergy symptoms than using either drug individually.  It's primarily used for symptomatic relief and doesn't treat the underlying cause of the illness.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary depending on the specific formulation (tablet, syrup, etc.), the manufacturer, and the patient's age and overall health. **Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist and the information printed on the medication's label.**  Never exceed the recommended dosage.

**General guidelines (these are examples and may not reflect all formulations):**

* **Adults (Oral):**  The typical adult dose might be one or two tablets or a specific measured amount of syrup, typically taken every 4-6 hours as needed, but not exceeding a maximum daily dose.

* **Children (Oral):** Dosage for children is strictly weight-based and age-dependent.  Syrup formulations are commonly used for children, with dosages carefully calculated according to the child's weight and age.  **Never administer adult medication to children.** Always consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosage instructions.

* **Intravenous (IV):**  This combination medication is not typically administered intravenously.  Intravenous administration would require a different formulation and is not common for these specific antihistamines.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Constipation
* Blurred vision
* Nausea
* Upset stomach

Less common but more serious side effects:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Fast or irregular heartbeat
* Seizures
* Difficulty urinating


**If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, stop taking the medication and contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works

As mentioned previously, this medication works through a combination of mechanisms:

* **Histamine Blockade:**  Both levocloperastine and chlorpheniramine block histamine receptors in the body. Histamine causes the symptoms of allergies and some cold symptoms. By blocking these receptors, the drugs reduce the effects of histamine, lessening symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and watery eyes.

* **Anticholinergic Effects (Chlorpheniramine):** Chlorpheniramine's anticholinergic properties help dry up excessive nasal secretions and reduce nasal congestion.  This action contributes to overall relief from cold symptoms.

The combination of these actions provides comprehensive relief from a range of cold and allergy symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Interactions with Other Drugs:** This medication can interact with other medications, especially those that cause drowsiness or affect the central nervous system. Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Drowsiness is a common side effect. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medication affects you.

* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication as it can enhance drowsiness.

* **Elderly Patients:** Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the side effects of this medication, particularly drowsiness and dizziness.

* **Patients with certain medical conditions:** Individuals with glaucoma, heart conditions, high blood pressure, enlarged prostate, or difficulty urinating should exercise caution and consult their doctor before use.
