# Levocloperastine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Levocloperastine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and other upper respiratory allergies.  Levocloperastine is an antihistamine that reduces the effects of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergy symptoms. Chlorpheniramine maleate is also an antihistamine with additional anticholinergic properties which helps dry up nasal secretions.  It's typically used to treat symptoms like:

* Runny nose
* Sneezing
* Itchy, watery eyes
* Itchy nose and throat
* Cough (due to post-nasal drip)


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect, particularly with chlorpheniramine.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth:** This is also common, especially with chlorpheniramine.
* **Dizziness:** Less common but possible.
* **Headache:** Less common but possible.
* **Constipation:** Less common but possible, particularly with chlorpheniramine's anticholinergic effects.
* **Blurred vision:** Less common but possible, particularly with chlorpheniramine's anticholinergic effects.
* **Nausea:**  Less frequent.
* **Difficulty urinating:** Less frequent, particularly with chlorpheniramine's anticholinergic effects.

More serious side effects are rare but should be reported to a doctor immediately. These include allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).


**How it Works:**

* **Levocloperastine:** This is a selective H1-receptor antagonist.  Histamine, released during allergic reactions, binds to H1 receptors, triggering allergy symptoms. Levocloperastine blocks histamine from binding to these receptors, thus reducing allergy symptoms.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is also an H1-receptor antagonist, but it also has anticholinergic properties.  This means it blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that contributes to nasal secretions. By blocking acetylcholine, it helps dry up runny noses.
