# Loteprednol + Tobramycin
### Generic Name
Loteprednol and Tobramycin

### Usage

Loteprednol and Tobramycin ophthalmic suspension is a combination medication used to treat various eye conditions.  Its primary use is in managing steroid-responsive inflammatory conditions of the eye where a corticosteroid is needed and there's a superficial bacterial infection or risk of one. This includes conditions like anterior uveitis (inflammation of the middle layer of the eye) and corneal injuries resulting from chemical burns, radiation, thermal burns, or foreign body penetration. The combination's effectiveness stems from the anti-inflammatory action of loteprednol (a corticosteroid) and the antibacterial action of tobramycin (an aminoglycoside antibiotic).

### Dosage

Dosage information provided here is for general knowledge and should not replace guidance from a healthcare professional. Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions.

**Ocular Inflammatory Conditions (Adult and Pediatric):**  The typical dosage for both adults and children is 1-2 drops of the ophthalmic suspension (containing 0.5% loteprednol and 0.3% tobramycin) into the affected eye(s) every 4-6 hours.  In the first 24-48 hours, the frequency may be increased to every 1-2 hours as needed. As the condition improves, the frequency should be gradually reduced.  Premature discontinuation of treatment should be avoided.  A physician should re-evaluate the patient's condition if symptoms don't improve after two days.  The initial prescription should not exceed 20 mL and refills should only be given after further evaluation by a doctor.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):

* Headache
* Eye redness
* Superficial punctate keratitis (tiny erosions on the cornea)

Less common side effects (occurring in 4-10% of patients):

* Increased intraocular pressure (eye pressure)
* Eye discomfort (burning, stinging)

Other less frequent side effects:  Corneal deposits, photophobia (light sensitivity), lacrimal apparatus disorders (tear duct problems), vision problems, eye itching, discharge, general eye disease, eyelid problems, and eye pruritus (itching).

**Serious but less common side effects are possible.**  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Loteprednol, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation by inhibiting the release of substances that cause swelling, redness, and pain in the eye.  It does this by suppressing the activity of phospholipase A2, an enzyme involved in the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

Tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, fights bacterial infections by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis. It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacterial cells, preventing them from producing essential proteins necessary for survival and replication.  This combined action effectively tackles both the inflammation and bacterial infection often associated with the targeted eye conditions.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to loteprednol, tobramycin, other corticosteroids, or any components of the formulation.  It should also be avoided in patients with viral infections of the cornea and conjunctiva (including herpes simplex keratitis, vaccinia, and varicella), fungal infections of the eye, or mycobacterial eye infections.

* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with glaucoma or a history of ocular herpes simplex.  Prolonged use can lead to increased intraocular pressure, cataracts, and delayed wound healing.  Patients should be monitored for these potential complications.  This medication should be used only as directed by a physician.

* **Interactions:**  Some medications may interact with loteprednol or tobramycin. It is important to inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins.  Ritodrine, for example, may have its adverse effects enhanced when used with corticosteroids.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** This medication is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the risks to the fetus are not fully understood.  The excretion of these drugs in breast milk is unknown; caution should be exercised if using during breastfeeding.
