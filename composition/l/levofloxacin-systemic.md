# Levofloxacin (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Levofloxacin (Systemic)

### Usage

Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolone class.  Its primary use is in treating various bacterial infections.  Specific examples include:

* **Community-acquired pneumonia:**  Infection of the lungs acquired outside of a hospital setting.
* **Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD):** Worsening of symptoms in individuals with long-term lung conditions like emphysema or chronic bronchitis.
* **Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis:**  Infection of the sinuses.
* **Chronic bacterial prostatitis:**  A long-term infection of the prostate gland.
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** Infections affecting the bladder, ureters, kidneys, or urethra (both uncomplicated and complicated).
* **Acute pyelonephritis:** A kidney infection.
* **Skin and skin-structure infections:** Infections affecting the skin and underlying tissues (both uncomplicated and complicated).


Levofloxacin also has secondary or off-label uses in treating more complex or severe infections, including inhalational anthrax (post-exposure), plague (treatment and prophylaxis), and certain types of  diabetic foot infections.  The use of Levofloxacin in these cases is often part of a combination therapy approach and should be guided by a healthcare professional.  It's crucial to remember that off-label use means the medication is prescribed for a condition not explicitly listed on the official label, and its efficacy and safety for those uses might require further research and expert opinion.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the infection being treated, the patient's age, weight, renal function, and the severity of the illness.  It's absolutely critical to follow the precise instructions given by your doctor or pharmacist.  The following information is for general knowledge only and should not be used as a substitute for personalized medical advice.


**Adults:**  Dosage ranges from 250 mg to 750 mg once or twice daily, typically for 5 to 14 days, but this can vary considerably depending on the specific infection and response to treatment.  The medication can be administered orally (tablet or suspension) or intravenously (IV).  IV administration usually requires a slow infusion over a period of time.

**Children:** Levofloxacin is generally not recommended for children unless absolutely necessary and under strict medical supervision due to potential risks to developing bones and joints. Dosage in children, if deemed necessary, is calculated based on weight (mg/kg/dose) and is given orally or intravenously.

**Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are often necessary for patients with reduced kidney function. Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on your creatinine clearance (CrCl) levels.

**Hepatic Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments might not be required, but close monitoring may be needed due to the limited metabolism by the liver.


**Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for the correct dosage and administration instructions.**

### How it Works

Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that works by inhibiting two crucial bacterial enzymes: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. These enzymes are vital for bacterial DNA replication and repair.  By blocking these enzymes, Levofloxacin prevents bacteria from multiplying and ultimately leads to their death.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Do not take Levofloxacin if you are allergic to it, other fluoroquinolones (like ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin), or any component of the medication.
* **Tendons:** Fluoroquinolones have been associated with tendonitis and tendon rupture, particularly in older adults or those with kidney problems.  Stop the medication and contact your doctor if you experience tendon pain.
* **Central Nervous System (CNS):**  Levofloxacin can affect the brain and nervous system, possibly causing seizures, confusion, hallucinations, or other neurological symptoms.  Use caution if you have a history of CNS disorders.
* **Glucose Regulation:**  Levofloxacin can affect blood sugar levels.  People with diabetes should monitor their glucose closely while taking this medicine.
* **Interactions:**  Levofloxacin can interact with several other drugs. Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbs, and supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Levofloxacin should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Consult your doctor before taking this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Photosensitivity:**  Levofloxacin can increase sensitivity to sunlight.  Avoid excessive sun exposure and wear protective clothing and sunscreen while using this medication.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is required for individuals with kidney disease.
