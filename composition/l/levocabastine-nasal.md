# Levocabastine (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Levocabastine (Nasal)

### Usage
Levocabastine nasal spray is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in individuals aged 12 years and older.  Allergic rhinitis is characterized by inflammation of the nasal passages caused by an allergic reaction, leading to symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose and eyes, and nasal congestion.  Levocabastine helps to alleviate these symptoms but does not address the underlying cause of the allergy.  It's important to note that this medication only treats the symptoms; it doesn't cure allergic rhinitis.

### Dosage

**Allergic Rhinitis:**

* **Adults (≤65 years) and Children ≥12 years:** The typical dose is two sprays into each nostril twice daily (BID).  If needed, the dose can be increased to two sprays in each nostril three to four times daily.  Treatment should be stopped if no improvement is seen within three days.

* **Nasal Solution (0.05%):** This is the standard concentration for nasal spray formulations.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

### How it Works

Levocabastine is a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist. Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction, causing many of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Levocabastine works by blocking histamine from binding to its receptors in the nasal passages. By preventing histamine's action, levocabastine reduces inflammation and alleviates symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and itching.  It's important to understand that levocabastine prevents histamine's effects; it doesn't stop the body from releasing histamine in the first place.  Levocabastine also has some activity at neurotensin receptors.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Levocabastine nasal spray is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to levocabastine or any of its components.
* **Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with kidney problems.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Levocabastine may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes.  It is excreted in breast milk, therefore caution is advised when using it during breastfeeding.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
