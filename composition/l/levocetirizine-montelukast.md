# Levocetirizine + Montelukast

**Generic Name:** Levocetirizine and Montelukast

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and seasonal allergies.  It's particularly helpful for people whose symptoms aren't adequately controlled by one medication alone. Levocetirizine is an antihistamine that reduces allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and hives. Montelukast is a leukotriene modifier that reduces inflammation in the airways, helping to control symptoms like nasal congestion and wheezing.  This combination is often prescribed for both daytime and nighttime allergy relief.  **It's crucial to note that this is not a rescue medication for acute asthma attacks.**


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Common:** Headache, drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue.
* **Less Common:**  Dry mouth, throat irritation, stomach upset, insomnia, nervousness, increased appetite.
* **Rare but Serious:**  (Requires immediate medical attention)  Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), liver problems (jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain), unusual bleeding or bruising, suicidal thoughts or behavior (especially in children and adolescents).


**How it Works:**

* **Levocetirizine:**  This is a selective antagonist of peripheral H1-receptors.  Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking the H1-receptors, levocetirizine prevents histamine from binding and causing allergy symptoms.

* **Montelukast:** This medication works by blocking leukotrienes. Leukotrienes are inflammatory substances that contribute to the swelling and narrowing of airways associated with allergies and asthma. By blocking leukotrienes, montelukast reduces inflammation and improves airflow.
