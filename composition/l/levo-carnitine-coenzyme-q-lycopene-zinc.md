These are all marketed individually and sometimes in various combinations, but there's no universally recognized generic equivalent.  The following information reflects the individual components and their potential synergistic effects, but **not a specific generic product**.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before taking any supplements, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.
