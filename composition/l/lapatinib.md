# Lapatinib

**Generic Name:** Lapatinib

**Usage:** Lapatinib is an oral medication used in the treatment of certain types of breast cancer.  Specifically, it's used:

* **In combination with capecitabine:**  To treat metastatic breast cancer that is HER2-positive and has progressed after treatment with trastuzumab (Herceptin) and an anthracycline (like doxorubicin).
* **As a single agent:**  For the treatment of metastatic breast cancer that is HER2-positive after prior treatment with trastuzumab and an anthracycline, or if the patient is unable to tolerate anthracyclines.  It may also be used in other situations where other HER2-targeted therapies haven't been successful.  Specific usage is determined by a physician based on individual patient factors.

**Side Effects:**  Lapatinib can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and some serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea:** Often severe and requires careful management.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Can be managed with anti-nausea medication.
* **Rash:** Can range from mild to severe.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Headache:**
* **Stomach pain:**
* **Hair thinning or hair loss (alopecia):**
* **Changes in nail appearance:**
* **Dry skin and mouth:**

**More serious side effects that require immediate medical attention include:**

* **Severe diarrhea:** Leading to dehydration.
* **Severe rash or allergic reactions:**
* **Liver problems:**  Changes in liver function tests.
* **Heart problems:**  Changes in heart rhythm or function (cardiotoxicity), particularly in patients with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Lung problems:**  Interstitial lung disease.
* **Bleeding:**
* **Increased risk of infections:** Due to suppressed immunity.


**How it Works:** Lapatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by blocking the activity of two specific proteins, HER1 (EGFR) and HER2 (erbB2). These proteins are involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells.  By inhibiting these proteins, lapatinib slows or stops the growth of cancer cells that overexpress HER2, a common characteristic of some breast cancers.
