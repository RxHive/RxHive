# Lapatinib

**Generic Name:** Lapatinib

**Usage:** Lapatinib is a targeted therapy used to treat certain types of breast cancer.  Specifically, it's used in combination with other medications for:

* **HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer:**  This means the cancer cells have too many HER2 proteins, which promote cancer growth.  Lapatinib is often used in patients who have already received other HER2-targeted therapies like trastuzumab (Herceptin).
* **HER2-positive advanced breast cancer:** Similar to metastatic, but may include locally advanced breast cancer that cannot be surgically removed.

It's important to note that lapatinib is *not* a first-line treatment for most HER2-positive breast cancers.  It's typically used after other treatments have been tried.  A doctor will determine if lapatinib is appropriate based on individual patient factors and cancer characteristics.

**Side Effects:** Like all medications, lapatinib can cause side effects.  Some common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea:** This is a very common and potentially severe side effect.  Patients should report any diarrhea to their doctor immediately.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are also common side effects.
* **Rash:** Skin rash is a frequent side effect.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Increased liver enzymes:** Liver function tests should be monitored regularly.
* **Hair thinning or loss (alopecia):** This can occur, although it's not always severe.
* **Nail changes:**  Nails may thicken or become brittle.
* **Interstitial lung disease (ILD):** A rare but serious side effect affecting the lungs.  Shortness of breath should be reported immediately.


These are not all the possible side effects.  More serious, although less frequent, side effects are possible and should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

**How it Works:** Lapatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  This means it works by blocking the action of the HER2 protein.  HER2 is a receptor on the surface of certain cancer cells that, when activated, sends signals that promote cell growth and division.  By blocking HER2, lapatinib slows down or stops the growth of cancer cells.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is lapatinib taken?**  A: Lapatinib is usually taken orally (by mouth) as a tablet, typically twice a day with food. The exact dosage and schedule are determined by a doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.

Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is necessary to manage side effects and assess treatment effectiveness.  Some potential long-term issues could include heart problems or permanent nerve damage.
* **Q: How effective is lapatinib?** A: The effectiveness of lapatinib varies depending on the individual and their specific cancer.  It's most effective when used in combination with other therapies, and response rates will differ across patients.
* **Q:  Is lapatinib curative?** A: No, lapatinib is not a cure for cancer. It's used to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells and improve quality of life.
