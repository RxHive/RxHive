# Lactitol + Fructo Oligosaccharide
### Generic Name
Lactitol + Fructo-Oligosaccharide (combination)


### Usage

Lactitol and fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) are often combined as a prebiotic laxative.  This means they work by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. The primary use of this combination is for the treatment of constipation.  It's particularly helpful in managing chronic constipation and can improve bowel regularity and stool consistency.  While not a primary indication, this combination might also be used to support gut health in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), though its effectiveness in IBS varies and should be discussed with a doctor.  It's important to note that this combination is not intended for acute or emergency relief of constipation.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific product formulation and the individual's needs.  Always follow the directions on the product label carefully. There's no standard IV administration for this combination, as it's typically taken orally.

**Oral:**

* **Adults:**  Typical starting doses range from 10-20 grams per day, often divided into multiple doses. The dose may be adjusted based on individual response and effectiveness.  It's crucial to increase the dose gradually to minimize side effects like gas or bloating.
* **Children:** Dosage for children should always be determined by a doctor.  The use of lactitol and FOS in children is typically not recommended without direct medical supervision.

**Forms:** This combination is often available in powder, tablet, or liquid forms.  Instructions for mixing or dissolving may vary depending on the specific product.  Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Gas, bloating, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea are the most common side effects. These are usually mild and temporary, often subsiding as the body adjusts to the medication.
* **Less Common but Serious:** While rare, severe diarrhea can lead to dehydration.  Seek medical attention if you experience severe or persistent diarrhea.  Allergic reactions are also possible, though uncommon.


### How it Works

Lactitol is a sugar alcohol that is poorly absorbed in the small intestine.  It reaches the large intestine largely intact, where it's fermented by gut bacteria. This fermentation process draws water into the colon, softening the stool and increasing its bulk, which promotes regular bowel movements. Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) are also prebiotics, meaning they act as food for beneficial bacteria in the gut.  By increasing the population of beneficial bacteria, FOS contributes to a healthier gut microbiome and can further improve bowel regularity and stool consistency. The combined effect of lactitol and FOS leads to more effective and comfortable bowel movements.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This combination should be avoided in individuals with known allergies to lactitol or FOS. Individuals with fructose malabsorption or severe gastrointestinal disorders should use caution and consult a doctor before use.
* **Drug Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently documented.  However, it's best to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to ensure there are no potential interactions.
* **Specific Warnings:**
    * **Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women:** Consult a doctor before using this combination during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
    * **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.  Start with a lower dose and monitor for any adverse reactions.
    * **Diabetics:** Lactitol contains calories and might affect blood sugar levels.  Diabetics should monitor their blood sugar carefully while using this combination.
