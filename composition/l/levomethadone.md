# Levomethadone
### Generic Name
Levomethadone

### Usage
Levomethadone is a synthetic opioid analgesic and antitussive primarily used for two key purposes: pain management and opioid maintenance therapy.  In pain management, it provides relief from moderate to severe pain, often used when other analgesics are ineffective or poorly tolerated.  Its role in opioid maintenance therapy is crucial for managing opioid addiction by reducing withdrawal symptoms and suppressing cravings. This helps individuals transition away from illicit opioid use under strict medical supervision.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Levomethadone dosage is highly individualized and critically depends on the patient's condition, specifically the presence and severity of withdrawal symptoms.  It's crucial to understand that the information below is a general guideline; a healthcare professional must determine the appropriate dose.

* **Pain Management and Opioid Maintenance Therapy (Oral):**
    * Initial dose:  15-20 mg (equivalent to 3-4 mL of solution) on the first day, usually in the morning.  A further 10-25 mg (2-5 mL) might be needed in the evening based on individual response. Patients with low or unknown tolerance should start with no more than 15 mg (3 mL).
    * After 1-6 days, a once-daily morning dose is usually implemented.  Adjustments are made in increments of 5-10 mg/day (1-2 mL) based on the presence or absence of withdrawal symptoms.
    * Maintenance dose: This can range up to 60 mg/day (12 mL) or, in rare cases, even higher.  Doses exceeding 50-60 mg should only be considered under exceptional circumstances and with careful evaluation to rule out concurrent use of other narcotics.
    * Elderly patients: Dosage reduction is usually necessary for elderly individuals.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Levomethadone is contraindicated in children and adolescents under 18 years old.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Reduce the dose for patients with liver problems.
* **Renal Impairment:** Reduce the dose for patients with kidney problems.

### How it Works

Levomethadone is a synthetic opioid, a derivative of morphine.  It acts as an opioid agonist, meaning it binds to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord. This binding produces analgesic (pain-relieving) effects and reduces withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent individuals. The mechanism in opioid addiction treatment involves both suppressing withdrawal symptoms and, with prolonged use, inducing tolerance to the euphoric effects of other opioids, thus deterring illicit use.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to levomethadone or any ingredient.
* Concurrent use of, or within two weeks of stopping, MAO inhibitors.
* Use with narcotic antagonists (e.g., naloxone) or other agonist/antagonists (e.g., pentazocine, buprenorphine), except for overdose treatment.
* Respiratory depression.
* Obstructive airway disease.
* Dependence on non-opioid drugs.
* Children and adolescents under 18 years.

**Increased Risk:**

* Addiction
* Reduced consciousness
* CNS or respiratory depression with other drugs
* Moderate-to-severe respiratory issues
* Increased intracranial pressure
* Hypotension (low blood pressure) with hypovolemia (low blood volume)
* Urinary retention (difficulty urinating) due to prostate enlargement
* Pancreatitis
* Biliary disorders
* Obstructive or inflammatory bowel disease
* Pheochromocytoma (adrenal gland tumor)
* Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)
* QT interval prolongation (heart rhythm disorder)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)

**Use with Caution:**

* Patients with asthma, COPD, or cor pulmonale (heart disease due to lung disease).
* Patients with increased intracranial pressure.
* High-risk patients.
* Patients with acute abdominal conditions.
* Patients with cardiac arrhythmias.
* Patients on class I and class III antiarrhythmic medications.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Levomethadone crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. It should only be used during pregnancy if absolutely necessary under close medical supervision.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking levomethadone.  Dosage reduction is advisable in breastfeeding mothers after childbirth to minimize effects on the newborn.

**Drug Interactions:**  Levomethadone's metabolism can be altered by certain medications, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, and flunitrazepam, potentially reducing its effectiveness.  Conversely, some antihypertensives (e.g., reserpine, clonidine, urapidil, prazosin) may enhance levomethadone's effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking levomethadone?**  A: No. Alcohol should be avoided as it can increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression.

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking levomethadone?** A: No.  Levomethadone can cause drowsiness and impair judgment.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for guidance. Do not double the next dose.

* **Q: How should I store levomethadone?** A: Store it as directed by your pharmacist, typically in a cool, dry place, away from children and pets.

* **Q: What happens if I suddenly stop taking levomethadone?** A: Abrupt cessation can cause severe withdrawal symptoms.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for discontinuation.

* **Q: Is levomethadone addictive?** A: Yes, levomethadone is an opioid and carries a risk of addiction.  It should only be used under strict medical supervision.  This risk is especially relevant in individuals with a history of substance abuse.
