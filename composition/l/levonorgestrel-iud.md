# Levonorgestrel (IUD)
### Generic Name
Levonorgestrel (IUD)

### Usage
Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices (IUDs) are primarily used for long-term contraception, offering protection for periods ranging from 3 to 6 years depending on the specific device.  A secondary, significant use is the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) in women who also desire contraception. The IUD works by releasing a steady, low dose of levonorgestrel, a progestin hormone, directly into the uterus.

### Dosage
Levonorgestrel IUDs come in various formulations, each containing a different amount of levonorgestrel and having a different duration of effectiveness.  The dosage isn't measured in terms of a daily pill, but rather in the total amount of levonorgestrel released over the lifespan of the device (typically 3, 5 or 6 years). The specific levonorgestrel content and release rate vary by brand and the duration of use. For example:

* **Contraception and Menorrhagia:**  The IUD is inserted intrauterinely by a healthcare professional.  The specific device (e.g., containing 13.5 mg, 19.5 mg, or 52 mg of levonorgestrel) determines the release rate and duration of effectiveness. Removal or replacement is recommended at the end of the specified timeframe (3, 5, or 6 years).

* **Pediatric Use:**  Postpubertal females can use levonorgestrel IUDs, with the dosage and duration mirroring the adult recommendations.

Dosage adjustments are not typically made based on renal or hepatic impairment;  in fact, active hepatic disease or liver tumors are contraindications to IUD use. Switching from other contraceptive methods to a levonorgestrel IUD or vice versa has specific guidelines to ensure continuous protection.  Always consult with a healthcare provider for guidance on these transitions.

### How it Works
Levonorgestrel IUDs primarily work by releasing a small amount of the hormone levonorgestrel into the uterus. This hormone thickens the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg. Levonorgestrel can also suppress ovulation (release of an egg) in some women and can potentially affect the lining of the uterus, making implantation of a fertilized egg less likely.  It is important to note that levonorgestrel is not effective once implantation has begun.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  Levonorgestrel IUDs are contraindicated in women who are pregnant or suspect they might be, have a history of ectopic pregnancy, have certain types of uterine abnormalities, active pelvic inflammatory disease, breast cancer, liver disease or tumors, undiagnosed uterine bleeding, certain infections, or allergies to levonorgestrel.

**Interactions:**  Some medications, such as enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., certain antibiotics and anticonvulsants), can reduce the effectiveness of the levonorgestrel IUD.  Certain medications can also affect levonorgestrel levels.  Always inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking.

**Specific Warnings:** Women with a history of depression, cardiovascular disease, or a predisposition to blood clots should discuss the risks and benefits of levonorgestrel IUDs with their doctor.  The IUD does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
