# Lurasidone
### Generic Name
Lurasidone

### Usage

Lurasidone is an atypical antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat schizophrenia in adults and adolescents aged 13-17 years.  It's also approved for treating depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar depression) in adults and children aged 10-17 years.  This can be as monotherapy (the sole treatment) or as adjunctive therapy (in addition to other treatments like lithium or valproate) for adults.  Importantly, lurasidone's efficacy in treating manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder hasn't been established.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Schizophrenia:** The initial dose is typically 40 mg once daily; no initial titration is needed. The recommended daily dose ranges from 40-160 mg, with a maximum of 160 mg per day.

* **Bipolar Depression (monotherapy or adjunctive):**  The starting dose is 20 mg once daily.  No initial titration is required. The recommended daily dose is 20-120 mg, with a maximum of 120 mg per day.

**Children and Adolescents:**

* **Schizophrenia (13-17 years):** The initial dose is 40 mg once daily. No titration is necessary. The recommended daily dose ranges from 40-80 mg, with a maximum of 80 mg per day.

* **Bipolar Depression (10-17 years):** The starting dose is 20 mg once daily.  No initial titration is required. The dose may be increased after one week based on clinical response. The recommended daily dose ranges from 20-80 mg, with a maximum of 80 mg per day.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  Consult the prescribing information for specific guidelines based on Child-Pugh class (for liver) and creatinine clearance (for kidneys).

**Administration:** Lurasidone must be taken with food containing at least 350 calories.

* Gastrointestinal: Various gastrointestinal issues including vomiting, dry mouth, diarrhea, decreased appetite.
* Dermatologic: Pruritus (itching), skin rash.
* Endocrine and metabolic: Weight gain, increased serum prolactin levels.
* Other: Urinary tract infections, influenza, back pain, blurred vision, increased serum creatinine.


**Rare but Potentially Serious Side Effects (Post-marketing or case reports):**

**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Lurasidone is an atypical antipsychotic that works by affecting neurotransmitters in the brain, primarily dopamine and serotonin. It blocks dopamine D2 receptors and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, which are believed to play a role in psychotic symptoms.  Its partial agonism at 5-HT1A receptors may contribute to its relatively lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects compared to typical antipsychotics.  This balanced effect on dopamine and serotonin helps reduce positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) and negative symptoms (flat affect, lack of motivation) of schizophrenia and bipolar depression.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to lurasidone or its components; concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.
* **Warnings:** Increased mortality risk in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis (lurasidone is not approved for this); increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, particularly in children and young adults; risk of orthostatic hypotension, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, metabolic changes (hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia), cardiac effects, tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, falls.
* **Interactions:** Lurasidone interacts with several medications, particularly those metabolized by CYP3A4.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist about potential drug interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Lurasidone is a Category B drug during pregnancy.  The effects on a developing fetus are unknown, and the decision to use during pregnancy should be made carefully, weighing the risks and benefits.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.

### FAQs

* **Q: Does Lurasidone cause weight gain?** A: Yes, weight gain is a possible side effect. Regular monitoring of weight and other metabolic parameters is important.
* **Q: Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Lurasidone?** A: No, grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided as they can interact with lurasidone and alter its effectiveness and side effects.
* **Q: How should I store Lurasidone?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Lurasidone suddenly?** A: No, you should never stop taking lurasidone suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.
