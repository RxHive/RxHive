# Liquid Paraffin + Milk of Magnesia + Sodium Picosulfate

**Generic Name:**  There isn't a single generic name for a combination product of Liquid Paraffin, Milk of Magnesia (Magnesium Hydroxide), and Sodium Picosulfate.  Each ingredient has its own generic name.  The product would likely be sold under a brand name.


**Usage:** This combination is a laxative used to relieve constipation.  Each ingredient contributes to the laxative effect:

* **Liquid Paraffin (Mineral Oil):** Lubricates the stool, making it easier to pass.  It acts as a stool softener.
* **Milk of Magnesia (Magnesium Hydroxide):**  Draws water into the intestines, softening the stool and stimulating bowel movements. It's a saline laxative.
* **Sodium Picosulfate:** Stimulates the bowel muscles to contract, promoting bowel movement. It's a stimulant laxative.

The combination aims for a more comprehensive approach to relieving constipation, utilizing different mechanisms of action.  It's typically used for short-term relief, not for chronic constipation.


**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage, but may include:

* **Liquid Paraffin:**  Anal leakage, oily stools, abdominal cramping, interference with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).  Rarely, lipoid pneumonia (if aspirated).
* **Milk of Magnesia:** Diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, dehydration (with excessive use), electrolyte imbalances (especially magnesium).
* **Sodium Picosulfate:** Abdominal cramping, diarrhea, nausea.  In rare cases, allergic reactions.

More serious side effects are rare but possible and necessitate immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:**  As detailed above, the three ingredients work through different mechanisms:

* **Liquid Paraffin:**  Lubricates the feces, allowing for easier passage.
* **Milk of Magnesia:**  Osmotically draws water into the intestines, softening the stool and increasing bowel motility.
* **Sodium Picosulfate:** Stimulates the intestinal muscles, increasing peristalsis (the wave-like muscle contractions that move stool through the intestines).
