# L-Methyl Folate Calcium + Pyridoxal- + Methylcobalamin + Vitamin D + Calcium Citrate Malate + Vitamin K

**Generic Name:** L-Methylfolate Calcium + Pyridoxal-5'-Phosphate + Methylcobalamin + Vitamin D3 + Calcium Citrate Malate + Vitamin K2 (Note:  The provided name is incomplete; Pyridoxal needs to be specified as Pyridoxal-5'-Phosphate, and Vitamin D and K need their specific forms indicated. This response assumes the most common forms.)

**Usage:**

This combination supplement is primarily used to address deficiencies in several essential vitamins and minerals crucial for various bodily functions.  Its components work synergistically to support:

* **Neuromuscular health:** Methylfolate (L-Methylfolate Calcium), pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (P5P - the active form of vitamin B6), and methylcobalamin (the active form of vitamin B12) are vital for nerve function, brain health, and the production of neurotransmitters. Deficiencies can lead to conditions like peripheral neuropathy, cognitive impairment, and anemia.

* **Bone health:** Vitamin D3 and calcium (from calcium citrate malate) are essential for maintaining strong bones and preventing osteoporosis and other bone-related diseases.  Calcium citrate malate is preferred over other calcium salts due to better absorption.

* **Cardiovascular health:** Vitamin K2 plays a crucial role in bone health and cardiovascular health by activating proteins involved in calcium metabolism. It helps direct calcium to the bones, reducing the risk of arterial calcification.

* **Overall health:** The combined action of these nutrients supports overall health and well-being, potentially improving energy levels, mood, and immune function. This combination is often recommended for individuals with suspected or diagnosed deficiencies, or those at high risk of developing them.  Specific indications may include conditions linked to deficiencies in the individual components.


**Dosage:**

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific product formulation, individual needs, and the healthcare provider's recommendations.  There is no universally standard dosage for this combination.  Always follow the instructions provided on the product label or by your physician.  It's crucial to remember that exceeding recommended doses can have negative consequences.  The supplement usually comes in tablet form.  Liquid forms are less common for this particular combination.

**Side Effects:**

* **Common:**  Mild gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea, constipation), headache, flushing.  These are usually dose-related and subside with reduced dosage or discontinuation.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), severe gastrointestinal distress.  These require immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:**

Each component in this supplement has a specific role:

* **Methylfolate:** The active form of folate, directly usable by the body for various metabolic processes, including DNA synthesis and neurotransmitter production.
* **Pyridoxal-5'-Phosphate:** The active form of vitamin B6, a coenzyme involved in numerous metabolic reactions, including the synthesis of neurotransmitters.
* **Methylcobalamin:** The active form of vitamin B12, essential for nerve function, red blood cell production, and DNA synthesis.
* **Vitamin D3:** Regulates calcium absorption and bone metabolism.
* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** Provides readily absorbable calcium for bone health and various other physiological functions.
* **Vitamin K2:** Directs calcium to bones and prevents calcification of arteries.

These nutrients work together to support optimal health by addressing deficiencies and promoting proper bodily functions.
