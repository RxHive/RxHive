# L-Methyl Folate Calcium + Pyridoxal- + Methylcobalamin + Vitamin D + Calcium Citrate Malate + Vitamin K

**Generic Name:**  This product doesn't have a single generic name as it's a combination of multiple vitamins and minerals.  The individual generic names are:

* L-Methylfolate (L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolic acid)
* Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (P5P - active form of vitamin B6)
* Methylcobalamin (active form of vitamin B12)
* Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3)
* Calcium Citrate Malate
* Vitamin K (likely K1 or K2,  specification needed on the product label)


**Usage:** This combination supplement is typically used to support:

* **Cognitive function:**  The B vitamins (folate, B6, and B12) are crucial for neurotransmitter production and brain health.  Methylcobalamin is particularly important for nerve function.
* **Mood:** Deficiencies in these B vitamins have been linked to mood disorders.
* **Cardiovascular health:** Folate, B6, and B12 play roles in homocysteine metabolism, high levels of which are associated with heart disease risk.  Vitamin K is important for blood clotting.
* **Bone health:** Vitamin D and Calcium are essential for bone health and density.
* **Immune function:** Vitamins D and K, and the B vitamins support a healthy immune system.

The specific usage will depend on individual needs and should be determined in consultation with a healthcare professional.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally rare, but possible side effects from the individual components include:

* **L-Methylfolate:**  Generally well-tolerated, but some individuals might experience mild gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea).  In rare cases, allergic reactions are possible.
* **Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate:** High doses can rarely cause nerve damage.
* **Methylcobalamin:** Generally well-tolerated, but very high doses can cause nausea, diarrhea, or itching.
* **Vitamin D:**  High doses can cause hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels).
* **Calcium Citrate Malate:**  High doses can cause constipation.
* **Vitamin K:** Usually well-tolerated, but may interfere with blood-thinning medications.


**How it Works:** Each component works independently but synergistically to support various bodily functions.

* **B Vitamins:**  Essential coenzymes involved in numerous metabolic processes, including neurotransmitter synthesis, DNA synthesis, and homocysteine metabolism.
* **Vitamin D:** Regulates calcium absorption and is crucial for bone health and immune function.
* **Calcium:**  Essential for bone health, muscle function, and nerve transmission.
* **Vitamin K:**  Essential for blood clotting and bone health.
