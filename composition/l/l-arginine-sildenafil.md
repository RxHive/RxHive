# L-Arginine + Sildenafil

**Generic Name:**  L-Arginine & Sildenafil (Note:  This is a combination not usually found as a single FDA-approved drug.  Products marketed as such may be unregulated or contain unverified ingredients.)

**Usage:**  This combination is *not* approved by the FDA as a single medication.  L-Arginine and Sildenafil are often marketed together as a purported treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED).  L-Arginine, an amino acid, is believed to improve blood flow, while Sildenafil (Viagra) enhances the effects of nitric oxide to increase blood flow to the penis.  **The combination's efficacy and safety are not established through rigorous clinical trials.**  Its use should be discussed with a physician.

**Side Effects:**  The side effects are a combination of those associated with L-Arginine and Sildenafil taken individually.  These can include:

* **Sildenafil Side Effects:** Headache, flushing, nasal congestion, upset stomach, visual disturbances (blurred vision, changes in color vision), dizziness, muscle aches, back pain.  More serious side effects, though rare, include prolonged erection (priapism), heart attack, stroke, and sudden hearing loss.
* **L-Arginine Side Effects:**  Generally well-tolerated, but can cause nausea, diarrhea, bloating, and allergic reactions in some individuals.  Higher doses may increase the risk of digestive upset.

It is crucial to note that the interaction between L-Arginine and Sildenafil is not fully understood, and unexpected side effects are possible.


**How it Works:**

* **Sildenafil:**  Inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5), which breaks down cyclic GMP (cGMP).  Increased cGMP levels relax smooth muscles in the blood vessels of the penis, allowing increased blood flow and facilitating an erection in response to sexual stimulation.
* **L-Arginine:**  A precursor to nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator.  It is thought that increasing NO levels may enhance blood flow to the penis, potentially assisting Sildenafil's action.  However, the effectiveness of L-Arginine in treating ED is not conclusively proven.

The theoretical synergy is that L-Arginine may boost Sildenafil's effect by increasing nitric oxide levels, but this is not proven in clinical studies on this specific combination.


**FAQs:**

* **Is L-Arginine + Sildenafil safe?**  The safety of this combination is not established.  While both components are generally considered relatively safe when used individually as directed, the combined effects are not fully understood, and potential interactions exist.
* **Is it effective for erectile dysfunction?**  There is limited scientific evidence supporting the combined effectiveness of L-Arginine and Sildenafil for ED. Sildenafil alone is an approved and effective treatment, but the addition of L-Arginine's impact is unclear and may not significantly enhance the benefits.
* **Where can I buy it?**  You may find products marketed as containing this combination online or in some supplement stores. However, the quality, purity, and dosage of ingredients in these products are not guaranteed, and purchasing from unregulated sources is risky.
* **Should I talk to a doctor before using it?**  **Absolutely.**  Always consult your doctor before taking any combination of medications or supplements, especially those related to cardiovascular health or sexual function.  They can assess your overall health and determine the safest and most effective treatment options for ED.
