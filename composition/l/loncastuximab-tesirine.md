# Loncastuximab Tesirine
### Generic Name
Loncastuximab Tesirine

### Usage
Loncastuximab tesirine is a targeted cancer therapy used to treat adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.  This means it's used in patients whose lymphoma has come back after previous treatments (relapsed) or hasn't responded to those treatments (refractory).  Specifically, it's indicated for patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. The types of large B-cell lymphoma it treats include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, DLBCL arising from low-grade lymphoma, and high-grade B-cell lymphoma.

### Dosage
The recommended dosage is administered intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes.  Premedication with dexamethasone (4 mg orally or intravenously twice daily for 3 days, starting the day before Loncastuximab Tesirine or at least 2 hours prior if not started the day before) is usually necessary unless contraindicated.

* **Large B-cell lymphoma:** The initial dosage is 0.15 mg/kg every 3 weeks for two cycles.  Subsequent cycles use a reduced dose of 0.075 mg/kg every 3 weeks.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST), no dosage adjustment is typically needed, but close monitoring for increased side effects is crucial.  Dosage adjustments for moderate or severe hepatic impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥30 mL/min.  Adjustments for CrCl 15-29 mL/min or end-stage renal disease are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.  However, Loncastuximab tesirine has minimal renal excretion.
* **Toxicity Management:** Dosage may be withheld or adjusted based on the severity of side effects.  For example, Loncastuximab tesirine should be withheld until neutrophil counts recover to ≥1 x 10⁹/L for neutropenia or until platelet counts reach ≥50,000/mcL for thrombocytopenia.  Similar holds may apply for other adverse reactions of Grade 3 or higher severity.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Loncastuximab tesirine in pediatric patients have not been established.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Edema (swelling)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Pruritus (itching) and skin rash
* Decreased serum albumin levels
* Increased gamma-glutamyl transferase levels
* Increased serum glucose levels
* Abdominal pain, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
* Anemia, neutropenia (low white blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Increased serum ALT and AST levels (liver enzymes)
* Musculoskeletal pain


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less frequently):**

* Pericardial effusion (fluid around the heart)
* Pericarditis (inflammation of the heart sac)
* Pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs)
* Pleurisy (inflammation of the lining of the lungs)
* Pneumonia
* Pneumonitis (lung inflammation)
* Serious infections (including opportunistic infections)
* Exfoliative dermatitis (severe skin reaction)
* Febrile neutropenia (fever and low white blood cell count)
* Ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen)
* Sepsis (life-threatening infection)


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Loncastuximab tesirine is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC).  It consists of an antibody that targets CD19 (a protein found on the surface of many B-cell lymphoma cells) and a potent cytotoxic agent (SG3199). The antibody delivers the cytotoxic drug directly to the cancerous B cells. Once inside the cells, SG3199 damages the DNA, leading to cell death.

### Precautions
* **Pregnancy:** Loncastuximab tesirine can harm a developing fetus.  Pregnancy testing is recommended for women of reproductive potential before starting treatment.  Effective contraception is advised during treatment and for a period after the last dose.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Women should not breastfeed during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose.
* **Infusion:**  Administer via intravenous infusion over 30 minutes using a dedicated line with a filter.  Avoid extravasation (leakage outside the vein), as this can cause tissue damage.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Patients with impaired liver or kidney function require careful monitoring.
* **Myelosuppression:**  Loncastuximab tesirine can suppress bone marrow function, leading to low blood cell counts. Regular blood tests are needed.
* **Infections:** There's an increased risk of infections, including serious ones.  Report any signs of infection to your doctor immediately.
* **Other interactions:**  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor to identify potential drug interactions.
