# Light mineral oil + White mineral oil
### Generic Name
Light Mineral Oil + White Mineral Oil

**Note:**  Light mineral oil and white mineral oil are essentially the same thing; the terms are often used interchangeably.  The difference lies primarily in marketing and purity standards.  "White mineral oil" often implies a higher level of refining and purification.  This information will treat them as one substance for the sake of simplicity.

### Usage
Mineral oil is primarily used as a laxative. It works by lubricating the stool, making it easier to pass.  This is particularly helpful for treating constipation, which can be caused by various factors including dehydration, low fiber intake, or certain medical conditions.  It's often used for short-term relief of occasional constipation.  


While less common, mineral oil has some other uses, such as:

* **Topical lubricant:** It can be used as a moisturizer for dry skin or as a lubricant for medical procedures.
* **Infant constipation (under strict medical supervision):**  In certain cases and under a doctor's strict guidance, mineral oil might be used to treat constipation in infants, but this is uncommon due to potential risks.


It's crucial to understand that mineral oil is **not** a treatment for the underlying cause of constipation. If constipation is persistent or recurring, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional to determine the root cause and appropriate management.


### Dosage
Dosage of mineral oil varies greatly depending on the reason for use and the individual's age and health.  It's **critical** to follow a doctor's or pharmacist's instructions precisely.  Self-medicating with mineral oil can be dangerous.

There is no universally recommended dosage for adults or children.  **Oral administration for constipation relief should only be undertaken as directed by a physician.**  Overuse can lead to serious complications.  

For topical use as a lubricant, a small amount is applied as needed.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Anal leakage, abdominal cramping, nausea.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Lipid pneumonia (aspiration of the oil into the lungs), rectal irritation, interference with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).  Prolonged use can also cause dependence.

**If any side effects occur, particularly serious ones, contact a healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works
Mineral oil acts as a lubricant in the intestines. It prevents water from being absorbed from the stool, making the stool softer and bulkier, and easier to pass through the bowels. It doesn't stimulate bowel movements directly like some other laxatives; instead, it physically facilitates the passage of stool.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Mineral oil should not be used in individuals with certain conditions, such as abdominal pain of unknown origin, appendicitis, or intestinal obstruction.
* **Drug Interactions:** Mineral oil may interact with some medications, reducing their absorption. This is particularly true for fat-soluble vitamins and certain drugs.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of mineral oil during pregnancy or breastfeeding should only occur under the direct supervision of a healthcare provider.  There is a potential for the baby to absorb the oil through the breast milk.
* **Children:** Use in children should only be under a doctor's strict guidance due to the risk of aspiration.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults are more susceptible to the side effects of mineral oil and should use it cautiously.
