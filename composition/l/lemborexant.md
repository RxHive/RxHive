# Lemborexant
### Generic Name
Lemborexant

### Usage
Lemborexant is a medication used to treat insomnia in adults.  Specifically, it's indicated for adults who experience difficulty falling asleep (sleep onset) and/or staying asleep (sleep maintenance).  It's designed to help improve sleep quality for individuals with these specific challenges.  Currently, it's not approved for use in children.

### Dosage
**Adults (Insomnia):**  The typical starting dose is 5 mg taken orally once daily at bedtime.  It's crucial to allow at least 7 hours between taking the medication and the planned wake-up time.  Depending on individual response and tolerability, the doctor may increase the dose to 10 mg once daily. The maximum recommended daily dose is 10 mg.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of lemborexant have not been established in children.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):**  For individuals with mild liver impairment, no dosage adjustment is typically necessary.  Those with moderate impairment should not exceed a maximum daily dose of 5 mg. Lemborexant is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with mild or moderate kidney impairment.  However, patients with severe renal impairment might experience increased drowsiness due to higher drug levels; close monitoring is advised.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Abnormal dreams
* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Nightmares
* Sleep paralysis


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Complex sleep-related disorders
* Hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations (hallucinations occurring just before falling asleep or just after waking)
* Cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone)

**Other Side Effects (Frequency Not Defined):**

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Lemborexant works by blocking the actions of orexins (also called hypocretins), which are neuropeptides that promote wakefulness.  By blocking the binding of orexins to their receptors (OX1R and OX2R) in the brain, lemborexant reduces wake drive, thereby facilitating sleep onset and maintenance.  In simpler terms, it helps to quiet down the brain's wake signals, allowing for easier sleep.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Lemborexant is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with narcolepsy.

**Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of sleep paralysis, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and cataplexy-like symptoms with lemborexant use.

**Use with Caution:** Lemborexant should be used cautiously in patients with:

* Depression (worsening of depression or suicidal thoughts may occur)
* A history of drug abuse or dependence
* Respiratory compromise (difficulty breathing), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or sleep apnea


**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Lemborexant may cause adverse effects during pregnancy.  Its excretion into breast milk is unknown.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using lemborexant if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
