# Lamivudine + Zidovudine

**Generic Name:** Lamivudine/Zidovudine (Combivir is a brand name example)


**Usage:**

Lamivudine/Zidovudine is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV infection in adults and children. It's typically used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs as part of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen.  It's *not* a cure for HIV, but it helps to suppress the virus and slow the progression of the disease, improving quality of life and lifespan.  It's also used to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV during pregnancy and childbirth.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Vomiting:** Throwing up.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose, watery stools.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping.
* **Myalgia:** Muscle aches or pains.
* **Abdominal pain:** Pain in the stomach area.
* **Rash:** Skin eruption.


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Lactic acidosis:** A buildup of lactic acid in the blood, a potentially life-threatening condition.
* **Hepatotoxicity:** Liver damage.
* **Pancreatitis:** Inflammation of the pancreas.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:** Nerve damage in the hands and feet causing tingling, numbness, or pain.
* **Anemia:** Low red blood cell count.
* **Neutropenia:** Low white blood cell count, increasing susceptibility to infections.


**How it Works:**

Lamivudine and zidovudine are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).  They work by interfering with the action of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme HIV needs to replicate itself.  Specifically:

* **Zidovudine (AZT):**  Blocks the enzyme's activity, preventing HIV from converting its RNA into DNA, a crucial step in the viral life cycle.
* **Lamivudine (3TC):**  Acts similarly to zidovudine, but with a slightly different mechanism, providing broader antiviral activity.  The combination of the two drugs helps to overcome the development of drug resistance.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Lamivudine/Zidovudine?** A:  It's generally advisable to limit alcohol consumption while on this medication, as alcohol can worsen some side effects like nausea and liver damage.  Consult your doctor.
* **Q: Can I take Lamivudine/Zidovudine with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions can occur.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.
* **Q:  What are the long-term effects?** A: Long-term use may lead to lactic acidosis, liver damage, and bone loss.  Regular monitoring is essential.
* **Q: Is this medication safe during pregnancy?** A: While it's used to prevent mother-to-child transmission, pregnancy requires careful monitoring due to potential side effects on both mother and child. Your doctor will closely monitor your health and the baby's development.
* **Q:  How is drug resistance managed?** A:  Drug resistance is a major concern with all HIV medications. Using the medication as prescribed and in combination with other drugs is key to minimizing resistance.  Regular viral load testing is also crucial to monitor effectiveness and adjust treatment as needed.
