# Lidocaine/ Lignocaine (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Lidocaine/Lignocaine (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Lidocaine ophthalmic is a local anesthetic used to numb the surface of the eye.  Its primary use is to provide temporary anesthesia during ophthalmological (eye-related) procedures. This allows for procedures like eye exams, minor surgeries, or the removal of foreign bodies to be performed with minimal patient discomfort.  While primarily used for procedures, it may also be considered in situations where temporary pain relief from eye irritation or minor trauma is needed, but this is less common and should always be under the direct guidance of an ophthalmologist.

### Dosage

**Ocular Anesthesia:**

* **Adults and Children:** For ophthalmic use, a 3.5% lidocaine gel is typically applied.  The recommended dose is 2 drops directly onto the surface of the eye in the area where the procedure will be performed.  Additional drops may be applied as needed to maintain the anesthetic effect during longer procedures. The duration of effect varies but is generally between 5 and 30 minutes.

**Important Note:**  The information provided here is for general understanding.  Always follow the dosage instructions provided by your ophthalmologist or as directed on the specific medication packaging.  Dosage may need to be adjusted based on individual patient needs and the specifics of the procedure.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Conjunctival hyperemia (redness of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids)
* Burning or stinging sensation upon application
* Temporary changes in the corneal epithelium (the outer layer of the cornea)
* Headache

Less common, but more serious, side effects may include permanent corneal ulceration or opacification, potentially resulting in vision loss.  These are associated with prolonged or inappropriate use.  Report any unusual or concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that works by temporarily blocking the transmission of nerve impulses. It does this by binding to sodium channels in nerve cell membranes, preventing sodium ions from entering the cells. This interruption of the sodium influx stops the generation and conduction of pain signals to the brain, resulting in a numbing effect.  In the eye, this creates localized anesthesia, effectively removing the sensation of pain in the treated area.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Lidocaine ophthalmic is categorized as pregnancy category B. While systemic absorption is minimal with ophthalmic application, it should only be used during pregnancy when clearly needed and the benefits outweigh potential risks.  Use during breastfeeding requires caution.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Lidocaine may interact with certain medications, including cimetidine, propranolol, beta-blockers, other antiarrhythmics, phenytoin, acetazolamide, and loop or thiazide diuretics. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about any medications you are currently taking before using lidocaine ophthalmic.
* **Other Precautions:**  Prolonged use of lidocaine ophthalmic increases the risk of serious corneal damage. This medication is for topical ophthalmic use only; it should never be injected.  Always discard any unused portion after a single application.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the numbing effect last?**  A: The numbing effect typically lasts between 5 and 30 minutes.

* **Q: Can I use lidocaine ophthalmic more than once a day?** A: No, unless directed otherwise by an ophthalmologist.  Overuse can lead to serious side effects.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any unusual or concerning side effects, such as severe eye pain, blurred vision, or persistent redness, to your doctor immediately.

* **Q: How should I store lidocaine ophthalmic?** A: Store according to the instructions provided on the label, usually at room temperature away from direct heat and light.  Keep out of reach of children.
