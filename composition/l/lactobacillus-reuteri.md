# Lactobacillus Reuteri
### Generic Name
Lactobacillus Reuteri

### Usage
*Lactobacillus reuteri* is a probiotic bacterium, a type of "good" bacteria naturally found in the human gut.  Its primary use is in restoring a healthy balance of gut flora. This is beneficial in several ways: it can help prevent or alleviate diarrhea, particularly in infants and young children.  It may also help reduce symptoms associated with colic and eczema in infants.  Some studies suggest potential benefits in managing *Helicobacter pylori* infection (a cause of stomach ulcers) and reducing dental caries (tooth decay) by inhibiting the growth of *Streptococcus mutans*.  While *L. reuteri* shows promise in these areas, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness consistently.  Currently, one specific application is the treatment of Beh√ßet's disease (though this is a less widely established use).

### Dosage
Dosage of *Lactobacillus reuteri* varies greatly depending on the specific product, the condition being treated, and the age of the patient.  It's crucial to follow the instructions on the specific product label carefully.  Dosage forms include capsules, tablets, and liquid suspensions (often drops for infants).  For example, infant colic might involve a specific number of drops administered daily, while treating diarrhea in adults might involve a different dosage and form (like capsules).  Always consult a healthcare provider or pharmacist to determine the appropriate dose for your specific situation.  Self-medicating without professional guidance can be risky.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and infrequent, including:

* Bloating
* Flatulence (gas)

Serious side effects are rare.  However, individuals with weakened immune systems or those with compromised gut integrity (e.g., after surgery) should exercise caution.  If you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects, discontinue use and seek medical attention immediately.

### How it Works
*Lactobacillus reuteri* works by several mechanisms. Primarily, it helps re-establish a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut.  This is achieved by competing with harmful bacteria for resources and space, thus preventing their overgrowth.  It also produces substances (like lactic acid) that create an acidic environment unfavorable to many harmful bacteria. Furthermore, it can stimulate the body's immune system locally in the gut, potentially enhancing the immune response against pathogens.  Its effectiveness in treating specific conditions depends on these mechanisms' ability to improve gut health and reduce inflammation.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Avoid if you have a known allergy to *Lactobacillus reuteri* or related components.
* **Immunocompromised individuals:** Use with caution in individuals with weakened immune systems, as probiotics may pose a risk in these cases.
* **Gut perforation:** Individuals with intestinal perforations (a hole in the gut wall) should avoid using *Lactobacillus reuteri* as it could exacerbate the condition.
* **Pregnancy and lactation:**  The safety of *Lactobacillus reuteri* during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established. Consult with your doctor before use.
* **Interactions:** Though generally considered safe, interactions with other medications are possible. Inform your healthcare provider of all medications and supplements you're taking.
* **Sensitive to milk protein:** Some products may contain milk derivatives.  Individuals with milk allergies should check product labels and use caution.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Lactobacillus reuteri?**  A: Store according to the product label instructions, typically refrigerated to maintain viability.

* **Q: Can I take Lactobacillus reuteri with other probiotics or medications?** A: While generally safe, inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications and supplements you're taking to ensure there are no interactions.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to notice benefits varies depending on the condition and individual.  Some people may see improvements quickly, while others may require a longer duration of treatment.

* **Q: Is Lactobacillus reuteri safe for children?** A:  Generally considered safe for children, but always consult a pediatrician before giving it to a child, especially infants.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
