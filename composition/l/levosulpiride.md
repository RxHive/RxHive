# Levosulpiride
### Generic Name
Levosulpiride

### Usage
Levosulpiride is primarily used to alleviate symptoms associated with functional (non-ulcer) dyspepsia.  This condition involves discomfort in the upper abdomen, and levosulpiride helps to manage symptoms such as abdominal fullness, epigastric discomfort (pain or burning behind the breastbone), heartburn, belching, nausea, and vomiting.  It's important to note that levosulpiride does not treat the underlying cause of dyspepsia but rather focuses on symptom relief.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For dyspepsia, the typical oral dose is 25 mg three times daily (TID). Treatment exceeding eight weeks is generally not recommended.

**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of levosulpiride in children have not been established, and it is therefore not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) impairment, as levosulpiride undergoes minimal metabolism in the liver.  However, caution is advised in patients with renal (kidney) impairment because levosulpiride is primarily eliminated through the kidneys.  A healthcare professional should be consulted to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary in these cases.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Nervous system: Dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia, abnormal gait, burning sensation, malaise, tremor.  Less common, but serious side effects include tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a life-threatening condition), and oromandibular dystonia (muscle spasms in the jaw).
* Cardiovascular:  Edema (swelling), hypertension (high blood pressure), cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat).
* Gastrointestinal:  Nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, heartburn.
* Dermatologic: Skin rash.
* Endocrine and Metabolic:  Increased libido, increased thirst, amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), gynecomastia (breast development in men), increased lactation.
* Genitourinary: Erectile dysfunction.


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Levosulpiride is a selective peripheral dopamine 2 (D2) receptor antagonist. This means it blocks the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, specifically at the D2 receptors located in the periphery (outside the brain). By blocking these receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, levosulpiride increases gastric motility (the movement of food through the stomach) and peristalsis (the wave-like muscle contractions that move food through the intestines). This improved gut movement helps to alleviate symptoms of dyspepsia.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Levosulpiride is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Known or suspected hypersensitivity (allergy) to levosulpiride or any of its components.
* Known or suspected pregnancy.
* Breastfeeding.
* Pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland).
* History of seizure disorders (e.g., epilepsy).
* Mania or bipolar disorder.
* Prolactin-dependent tumors (e.g., certain types of breast cancer).
* Conditions where increased gastrointestinal motility could be harmful, such as mechanical bowel obstruction, perforation, or hemorrhage.


**Warnings and Precautions:**  Use with caution in patients with:

* Hypertension.
* Renal impairment.
* Elderly patients.
* Patients performing tasks requiring mental alertness (e.g., driving, operating machinery) due to potential drowsiness or dizziness.


Levosulpiride may interact with other medications, including cardiac glycosides, anticholinergic agents, alcohol, benzamide derivatives, and certain diuretics.  It is crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
