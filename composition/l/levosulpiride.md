# Levosulpiride

**Generic Name:** Levosulpiride

**Usage:** Levosulpiride is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist primarily used in the treatment of:

* **Gastrointestinal disorders:** It's used to alleviate symptoms of functional dyspepsia (indigestion), including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloating.  It's often prescribed for conditions where gastric motility is impaired.
* **Neurological disorders (less common now due to side effect concerns):**  Historically, it has been used in some countries for the treatment of certain neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease-related nausea and vomiting, although newer and safer options are generally preferred.  Its use in neurological conditions is decreasing.

**Important Note:**  The use of levosulpiride varies by country and is becoming less common due to safety concerns (see side effects).  Always consult a doctor for appropriate use.


**Side Effects:**  Levosulpiride can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These include:

* **Common:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, headache, insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, vomiting.
* **Less common but potentially serious:**  Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as Parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia), akathisia (restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements, particularly of the face and tongue – this can be irreversible),  galactorrhea (breast milk production in non-lactating individuals), gynecomastia (breast enlargement in males), amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), hyperprolactinemia (elevated prolactin levels).  These are particularly concerning with long-term use.
* **Rare but serious:**  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS – a life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status),  agranulocytosis (a severe drop in white blood cells), cardiac arrhythmias.


**How it Works:** Levosulpiride is a selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist. This means it blocks the action of dopamine at specific D2 receptors in the brain and gastrointestinal tract.  By blocking dopamine in the brain, it can have a calming effect (although this use is largely replaced by other medications) and by affecting dopamine in the gut, it can improve gastric motility and relieve symptoms of dyspepsia.  It's believed to have a higher affinity for D2 receptors in the periphery than in the central nervous system which (theoretically) reduces the risk of central side effects, however,  this difference is not always sufficient to prevent them.


**FAQs:**

* **Is levosulpiride addictive?**  Levosulpiride is not considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids or benzodiazepines. However, psychological dependence can occur, meaning a person may feel they need the medication even if it's no longer medically necessary.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking levosulpiride?**  Alcohol can increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects.  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking levosulpiride.

* **Can I take levosulpiride with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible.

* **How long does it take to work?**  The time it takes for levosulpiride to start working varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual.  For gastrointestinal symptoms, relief might be felt relatively quickly, while effects on neurological conditions may take longer.

* **What are the long-term risks?** The most serious long-term risks are related to prolonged hyperprolactinemia and the development of tardive dyskinesia.  Regular monitoring is necessary if long-term treatment is considered.
