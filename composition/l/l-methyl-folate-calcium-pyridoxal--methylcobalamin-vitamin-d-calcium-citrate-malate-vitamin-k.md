* **Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol):** Essential for calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and various other bodily processes.  Deficiency can lead to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.

* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** A highly bioavailable form of calcium, critical for bone health, muscle function, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.

* **Vitamin K2 (MK-7):**  Plays a role in blood clotting and bone health by activating proteins that regulate calcium deposition in bones.  It helps direct calcium to bones and away from soft tissues.


This combined supplement is often marketed to support cardiovascular health, bone health, cognitive function, and overall well-being. However, it's crucial to understand that the effectiveness of this combination for specific health conditions requires further research.
