# Levodopa + Carbidopa + Entacapone

**Generic Name:** Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone

**Usage:**

Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone is used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.  It's a combination drug where:

* **Levodopa:** Is a precursor to dopamine, a neurotransmitter that's deficient in people with Parkinson's disease.  It helps replenish dopamine levels in the brain.
* **Carbidopa:** Prevents levodopa from being broken down before it reaches the brain, thus increasing the amount of levodopa available to treat Parkinson's symptoms.  It reduces side effects associated with levodopa.
* **Entacapone:**  Inhibits an enzyme (catechol-O-methyltransferase or COMT) that breaks down levodopa and dopamine. This further increases the amount of levodopa available in the brain and extends its effects, leading to better symptom control and reducing "wearing off" effects (fluctuations in symptom control).


**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, involuntary movements (dyskinesias â€“ jerky, uncontrolled movements), muscle spasms, weakness, insomnia, vivid dreams, or nightmares.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Orthostatic hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing), hallucinations, confusion, depression, anxiety, cardiac arrhythmias, liver problems (rare),  severe allergic reactions.
* **Long-Term Use:**  The risk of dyskinesias (involuntary movements) increases with prolonged use.


**How it Works:**

As mentioned above, this combination medication works by increasing the amount of dopamine available in the brain. Levodopa is converted to dopamine in the brain. Carbidopa prevents the breakdown of levodopa in the periphery (outside the brain), ensuring more reaches the brain. Entacapone further enhances this effect by blocking the enzyme that breaks down both levodopa and dopamine.  This results in improved motor control, reducing symptoms like tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement (bradykinesia), and postural instability.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is this medication taken?**  A:  It's usually taken orally, as directed by a doctor.  The dosage varies depending on individual needs and response.

* **Q: What should I avoid while taking this medication?** A: Avoid alcohol and other central nervous system depressants (e.g., sedatives) as they can worsen drowsiness.  Inform your doctor of all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions can occur.

* **Q: What are the signs of an allergic reaction?** A:  Signs of an allergic reaction include rash, hives, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing or swallowing. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these.

* **Q: Can I suddenly stop taking this medication?** A: No, never stop taking this medication abruptly.  Sudden cessation can lead to serious complications, including a worsening of Parkinson's symptoms.  Dosage reduction must be done gradually under the supervision of a physician.

* **Q:  What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: Can I drive while taking this medication?** A: Drowsiness and dizziness are possible side effects.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
