# Levofloxacin + Lactobacillus

It's important to understand that there is no standard, commercially available combination drug product containing both levofloxacin and lactobacillus.  They are often prescribed *together*, but separately, due to their different mechanisms of action and potential interactions.  Therefore, the information below describes the individual drugs and their potential use together, not a combined product.


**Generic Name:**

* **Levofloxacin:**  A fluoroquinolone antibiotic
* **Lactobacillus:**  A genus of probiotic bacteria (various species are used, commonly *Lactobacillus rhamnosus*, *Lactobacillus acidophilus*, etc.)


**Usage:**

* **Levofloxacin:** Used to treat various bacterial infections, including pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, skin infections, and urinary tract infections.  It's a broad-spectrum antibiotic.
* **Lactobacillus:** Used to restore the balance of gut flora, often after antibiotic treatment (like levofloxacin) that can disrupt the natural bacterial community. This helps prevent or treat diarrhea, yeast infections, and other gastrointestinal issues.


**Side Effects:**

* **Levofloxacin:**  Can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, insomnia, tendonitis, and rarely, more serious side effects like liver damage, seizures, and allergic reactions.  *Note: Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, carry a boxed warning regarding serious adverse events, including tendon rupture*.
* **Lactobacillus:** Generally well-tolerated, but some individuals may experience mild gas or bloating.  Rarely, allergic reactions are possible.


**How it Works:**

* **Levofloxacin:** Kills bacteria by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for DNA replication and repair.
* **Lactobacillus:** Probiotic strains of lactobacillus compete with harmful bacteria for resources and space in the gut, preventing their overgrowth and promoting a healthy gut microbiome.  They may also produce substances that inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria.


**FAQs:**

* **Why are levofloxacin and lactobacillus sometimes prescribed together?**  Antibiotics like levofloxacin can disrupt the natural gut flora, leading to diarrhea, yeast infections, and other problems.  Lactobacillus supplements are often prescribed concurrently to mitigate these side effects and help restore a balanced gut microbiome.

* **Can I take lactobacillus while on levofloxacin?**  While often used together,  it's crucial to consult a doctor or pharmacist. The timing of taking them (e.g., separating them by several hours) might be suggested to maximize the effectiveness of both medications.

* **Are there any interactions between levofloxacin and lactobacillus?** There are no known direct interactions. However, the lactobacillus may slightly reduce the effectiveness of the levofloxacin, but usually not significantly.

* **What if I experience side effects?**  Stop taking the medication and contact your doctor immediately if you experience serious side effects.  For mild side effects, you may be advised to continue the treatment, but consult your doctor.
