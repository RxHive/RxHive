# Levomefolate Calcium
### Generic Name
Levomefolate Calcium

### Usage

Levomefolate calcium is a nutritional supplement primarily used to address suboptimal levels of L-methylfolate in the body.  It's particularly beneficial for individuals with major depressive disorder who may have low levels of this essential folate form.  Additionally, it's used to treat or prevent anemia in patients with schizophrenia who also have low L-methylfolate levels.  The goal is to replenish L-methylfolate, a crucial form of folate needed for various bodily functions, including DNA synthesis and neurotransmitter production.  It's important to note that levomefolate calcium is not a standalone treatment for depression or schizophrenia but rather a supportive therapy used in conjunction with other treatments.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The typical adult dosage is one capsule daily (qd), taken with or without food.  A specific dosage of 15mg of Levomefolate Calcium with 90.314 mg of algal powder is commonly used in capsules.  However, always follow the prescription and instructions provided by your healthcare provider, as dosages may vary.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of levomefolate calcium in children have not been established.  Therefore, it's not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Currently, there are no specific dosage adjustments recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice if you have these conditions.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild. However, seek medical attention if you experience:

*   Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)

Serious but less common side effects are rare.  Should any unexpected or concerning side effects occur,  immediately contact your doctor or other healthcare professional.

### How it Works

Levomefolate calcium works by directly replenishing L-methylfolate levels in the body.  L-methylfolate is the biologically active form of folate, meaning it's readily usable by the body. Unlike other forms of folate, L-methylfolate does not require conversion in the liver to be utilized. This direct action makes it effective in individuals who might have difficulties metabolizing other folate forms.  By increasing L-methylfolate levels, it supports various metabolic processes, including the production of neurotransmitters vital for brain function and mood regulation, and DNA synthesis crucial for cell growth and repair.

### Precautions

*   **Hypersensitivity:**  Levomefolate calcium should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to it or related compounds.
*   **Vitamin B12 Deficiency:** It's contraindicated as monotherapy for pernicious anemia or other megaloblastic anemias when anemia is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. It should be used with caution in people with a family history of bipolar illness.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Numerous interactions are possible.  Levomefolate calcium may interact with antiepileptic drugs, cholestyramine, colestipol, cycloserine, fluoxetine, isotretinoin, L-dopa, triamterene, colchicine, trimethoprim, NSAIDs, oral contraceptives, methylprednisolone, pancreatic enzymes, pentamidine, pyrimethamine, smoking, alcohol, sulfasalazine, metformin, and warfarin. Concomitant use with these medications is generally not recommended. Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of levomefolate calcium during pregnancy and breastfeeding is currently unknown.  Use with caution and only under the guidance of a healthcare provider.
*   **High Doses:** Doses exceeding 0.1 mg/day might mask pernicious anemia, potentially leading to irreversible nerve damage.
