# Lusutrombopag
### Generic Name
Lusutrombopag

### Usage
Lusutrombopag is a medication used to treat thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) in adults with chronic liver disease who are about to undergo a medical procedure.  It's specifically designed to help raise platelet levels temporarily before the procedure, reducing the risk of bleeding complications.  It's important to note that lusutrombopag is *not* intended to normalize platelet counts long-term in patients with chronic liver disease.

### Dosage
**Adults with Chronic Liver Disease-Associated Thrombocytopenia:** The typical dosage is 3 mg once daily (OD) for seven days. Treatment should begin 8-14 days before the scheduled procedure, and the procedure should be performed 2-8 days after the last dose of lusutrombopag.  The medication is taken orally and can be administered with or without food. If a dose is missed, take it as soon as possible on the same day and resume the regular schedule the next day.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of lusutrombopag in children have not yet been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are specifically recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B) or renal impairment (CrCl â‰¥30 mL/min).  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) or for those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of <30 mL/min or those undergoing hemodialysis.  However, studies suggest that mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment does not significantly alter lusutrombopag pharmacokinetics.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

* Headache
* Portal vein thrombosis (a serious, but less common, side effect)

It's crucial to report any unusual or concerning side effects to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Lusutrombopag is a thrombopoietic agent, meaning it stimulates platelet production. It works by binding to the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor on bone marrow cells. This binding initiates a cascade of events that leads to increased production and maturation of megakaryocytes (the cells that produce platelets). The resulting increase in platelet count helps reduce the risk of bleeding during a medical procedure.

### Precautions
* **Increased Risk of Thromboembolic Events:** Lusutrombopag increases the risk of thrombotic or thromboembolic complications (blood clots).  It should be used cautiously in patients with known risk factors for these conditions (e.g., Factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210A mutation, antithrombin deficiency, protein C or S deficiency).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of lusutrombopag during pregnancy is unknown. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least 28 days after the last dose.
* **No Contraindications:** Currently, there are no specific contraindications reported in the manufacturer's labeling. However, careful consideration is necessary for patients with pre-existing conditions or those taking other medications.  Consult a doctor.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Lusutrombopag long-term to manage my low platelet count?** A: No, lusutrombopag is intended for short-term use before a medical procedure in patients with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia.  It's not meant for long-term management of low platelet counts.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day. Then, resume your regular dosing schedule the next day.
* **Q: How should I store Lusutrombopag?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication label. Generally, medications should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.
