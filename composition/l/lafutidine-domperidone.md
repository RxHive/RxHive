# Lafutidine + Domperidone

**Generic Name:** Lafutidine + Domperidone


**Usage:**  This combination medication is typically used to treat symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and functional dyspepsia.  Lafutidine is an H2-receptor antagonist that reduces stomach acid production, while domperidone is a prokinetic agent that improves gastric emptying and reduces nausea and vomiting.  It's important to note that this combination is not approved in all countries and its use may vary depending on regional guidelines and physician recommendations.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment should always be determined by a healthcare professional.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects may include:

* **Lafutidine:** Headache, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness.  Rarely, more serious side effects such as liver problems can occur.
* **Domperidone:** Headache, dizziness, sleepiness, dry mouth, diarrhea, breast enlargement or galactorrhea (milk production) in some cases, particularly in women.  Rare, but potentially serious side effects include cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat).  **Domperidone carries a black box warning regarding cardiac risks, especially in older adults and those with certain pre-existing conditions.**

It is crucial to report any unusual or concerning side effects to a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:**

* **Lafutidine:** Works by blocking histamine H2 receptors in the stomach, thus reducing the production of stomach acid. This helps to alleviate the symptoms of heartburn, acid reflux, and other conditions associated with excess stomach acid.
* **Domperidone:**  Increases the motility (movement) of the stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract. This helps to speed up the emptying of the stomach, relieving symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and bloating associated with delayed gastric emptying. It also acts on the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brain to reduce nausea and vomiting.
