# Levocloperastine

**Generic Name:** Levocetirizine (Note: Levocloperastine is not a widely used or recognized generic name for a drug.  Levocetirizine is the correct generic name for a similar drug with a similar mechanism.)

**Usage:**  Levocetirizine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies such as:

* Sneezing
* Runny nose
* Itchy, watery eyes
* Itching of the nose and throat
* Hives (urticaria)
* Itching
* Skin rash

It's also sometimes used to treat chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU).  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will depend on the individual and the condition being treated.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, levocetirizine can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* Drowsiness (this is more common at higher doses)
* Dry mouth
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Stomach pain
* Diarrhea
* Sore throat

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention.  These include:

* Difficulty breathing or swallowing
* Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema)
* Fast heartbeat
* Severe skin rash


**How it Works:** Levocetirizine is a selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonist. This means it works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  By blocking histamine, it reduces the symptoms associated with allergies.


**FAQs:**

* **Is levocetirizine habit-forming?** No, levocetirizine is not considered habit-forming.
