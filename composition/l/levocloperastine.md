# Levocloperastine
### Generic Name
Levocloperastine

### Usage
Levocloperastine is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of coughs associated with both acute and chronic respiratory illnesses.  It helps to reduce the urge to cough, providing relief from the discomfort and potentially improving sleep and daily activities.  While its primary use focuses on cough suppression, its mechanism of action also involves antihistamine, antiserotonergic, and smooth muscle relaxant properties. These secondary actions might offer some ancillary benefit in managing associated symptoms, although it's not the main reason for its prescription.  Always consult a healthcare professional to determine if levocloperastine is the right treatment for your cough.

### Dosage
The standard adult dosage for cough associated with acute and chronic respiratory disorders is 20 mg administered orally three times a day (TID).  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.  There is no information provided regarding pediatric dosages; therefore, it's crucial to consult a physician before administering levocloperastine to children.  The medication is typically available in oral suspension form.  Always follow the prescription instructions and consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about the correct dosage or administration.

### Side Effects
Common side effects, while typically mild and transient, can include:

* Nausea
* Gastrointestinal effects
* Exhaustion
* Faintness
* Somnolence (sleepiness)
* Clouding of consciousness
* Numbness
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Palpitations

Less common, but more serious side effects may occur. If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms, immediately consult your healthcare provider.

### How it Works
Levocloperastine primarily works by acting on the central nervous system (CNS) to suppress the cough reflex at the bulbar cough center. This directly reduces the urge to cough.  Additionally, its antihistamine, antiserotonergic, and smooth muscle relaxant properties contribute to its overall effectiveness in managing cough and potentially related symptoms like bronchospasm.

* Patients with hypersensitivity to levocloperastine or any formulation component.
