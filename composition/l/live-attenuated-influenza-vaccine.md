# Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine

**Generic Name:**  Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) –  Note: There isn't one single generic name, as different manufacturers may have slightly different formulations.  The common name reflects the type of vaccine.  Brand names include FluMist (currently unavailable in the US).

**Usage:**  LAIV is used to help protect against influenza (flu) viruses.  It's typically recommended for healthy non-pregnant individuals aged 2 through 49 years old (specific age ranges may vary slightly depending on the formulation and country-specific recommendations).  It is not recommended for individuals with certain health conditions (see FAQs).

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Runny nose
* Congestion
* Sore throat
* Cough
* Headache
* Muscle aches
* Fever (less common)

Serious side effects are rare but can include allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).

**How it Works:** LAIV contains weakened (attenuated) live influenza viruses.  After vaccination, these weakened viruses replicate in the nose and throat, triggering an immune response. This response produces antibodies that help protect against future infection by similar influenza viruses.  The weakened viruses are not strong enough to cause the flu illness.

**FAQs:**

* **Who should NOT get LAIV?**  LAIV is generally not recommended for:
    * Pregnant women
    * Individuals with weakened immune systems (e.g., due to HIV, cancer, or certain medications)
    * Children younger than 2 years old or older than 49 years old (age limits can vary)
    * Individuals with asthma or other chronic respiratory conditions (check with your doctor)
    * Individuals who live with someone with a weakened immune system
    * People who have had Guillain-Barré syndrome.
* **Is LAIV effective?** LAIV's effectiveness varies from year to year, depending on the match between the vaccine strains and the circulating flu viruses.  It's generally considered less effective than inactivated influenza vaccines (the shot), especially in older children and adults.
* **What are the differences between LAIV and the inactivated influenza vaccine (flu shot)?** The main difference is that LAIV uses weakened live viruses, while the inactivated vaccine uses killed viruses.  LAIV is administered as a nasal spray, while the inactivated vaccine is an injection.  Inactivated vaccines are generally considered more effective and are recommended for most people.
* **Can I get the flu from LAIV?**  It's very unlikely. The viruses in LAIV are weakened to the point where they rarely cause illness. However, you might experience mild flu-like symptoms as your body builds immunity.
* **Is LAIV safe for children with allergies?**  Individuals with egg allergies can usually receive LAIV. However, it's crucial to discuss any allergies with your doctor before vaccination.
* **If I’ve had the flu shot in the past, can I get LAIV this year?**  No, it's generally recommended to receive either the inactivated flu vaccine (the shot) or the LAIV, but not both in the same flu season.
