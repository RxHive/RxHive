# Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine
### Generic Name
Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV)

### Usage
The live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also known by brand names like FluMistÂ®, is used to prevent influenza (flu).  It protects against the influenza viruses that are expected to circulate widely during a particular flu season.  The specific strains included in the vaccine vary from year to year, as the virus mutates. LAIV is primarily used for the prevention of influenza in healthy individuals aged 2 through 49 years.  While it was once approved for use in children aged 6 months to 8 years, this is no longer the case in most regions due to effectiveness concerns. It's crucial to note that LAIV is *not* recommended for individuals with certain health conditions (detailed in the Precautions section).  LAIV does not protect against other respiratory illnesses.

### Dosage
LAIV is administered as a single dose, intranasally (through the nose).  It's a spray administered directly into each nostril.  There's no separate dosage for adults and children within the approved age range (2-49 years).  There is no intravenous (IV) form of LAIV.  The vaccine should be given only during the recommended time frame by your healthcare provider, typically in the fall before flu season begins.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Runny nose
* Congestion
* Sore throat
* Cough
* Headache
* Muscle aches
* Fever
* Vomiting (rare)
* Wheezing (rare)


Less common, but more serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention.  These may include:

* Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) - characterized by difficulty breathing, hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue
* Wheezing or shortness of breath (especially in individuals with asthma or other respiratory conditions)


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
LAIV works by introducing weakened (attenuated) influenza viruses into the body. These weakened viruses replicate in the nasal passages, stimulating an immune response.  This immune response produces antibodies that help protect against infection by the actual influenza viruses should you encounter them.  The weakened viruses are not strong enough to cause the flu, but they're sufficiently similar to trigger the body's defenses.

### Precautions
LAIV is **not** recommended for individuals with:

* Severe egg allergy
* Asthma or other chronic respiratory conditions (consult your doctor)
* Weakened immune system (e.g., due to HIV, cancer, or medications that suppress the immune system)
* Pregnancy
* Close contact with individuals with weakened immune systems
* Children younger than 2 years old or older than 49 years old.


LAIV may interact with certain medications, such as antiviral drugs used to treat influenza. Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.

### FAQs

* **Q: Is LAIV as effective as the injectable flu vaccine?** A:  The effectiveness of LAIV can vary from year to year and may be slightly lower compared to the injectable flu vaccine (inactivated influenza vaccine).

* **Q: Can I get the flu from LAIV?** A:  The viruses in LAIV are weakened, making it very unlikely to cause the flu.  However, some mild flu-like symptoms are possible.

* **Q: How long does LAIV protection last?** A:  Protection typically lasts for a single flu season.  Annual vaccination is recommended.

* **Q:  What should I do if I have a severe allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  This is a medical emergency.

* **Q: How should I store LAIV?** A:  LAIV must be stored according to the instructions provided with the vaccine, usually refrigerated at a specified temperature.
