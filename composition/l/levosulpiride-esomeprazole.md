# Levosulpiride + Esomeprazole
### Generic Name

Levosulpiride + Esomeprazole


### Usage

This combination medication, containing levosulpiride and esomeprazole, is primarily used to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that are complicated by nausea and vomiting.  Levosulpiride, a selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, helps control nausea and vomiting. Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), reduces stomach acid production, which is a key factor in GERD.  Therefore, this combined formulation tackles both the acid reflux and the associated gastrointestinal discomfort. While its primary use is for GERD with nausea and vomiting, a physician might prescribe it off-label in situations where both gastric acid reduction and antiemetic effects are deemed necessary.  Always consult a doctor to determine if this combination is appropriate for your specific condition.


### Dosage

Dosage will be determined by a healthcare professional and tailored to the individual's needs and condition.  There's no standardized, universally accepted dosage for this specific combination as it's not a pre-packaged, fixed-dose combination readily available in many markets.  The physician will prescribe the appropriate doses of levosulpiride and esomeprazole separately.

**Levosulpiride:** The dosage for levosulpiride varies depending on the indication and the patient's age, weight, and kidney function. It is typically administered orally.  Children's doses are calculated based on weight and determined by a physician.  It's crucial to note that levosulpiride is not suitable for all children.  

**Esomeprazole:** Esomeprazole dosage also varies based on the indication and patient factors. It's available in oral forms (tablets, capsules) and intravenous (IV) formulations for hospitalized patients.  Dosage adjustments are often necessary for patients with liver or kidney impairment.  Children's doses are also weight-based and determined by a physician.

**Important Note:**  Never attempt to self-medicate with this combination.  The precise dosage of both components must be prescribed and monitored by a doctor.

### How it Works

**Levosulpiride:** Works by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain, thereby reducing nausea and vomiting signals.

**Esomeprazole:**  Inhibits the proton pump in the stomach lining, drastically reducing the secretion of gastric acid. By lowering stomach acid levels, it alleviates the symptoms of GERD, such as heartburn and acid reflux.  The combined effect of both drugs tackles both the acid production and the resulting nausea/vomiting.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Levosulpiride is contraindicated in patients with prolactinoma (a type of brain tumor), pheochromocytoma (a rare adrenal gland tumor), and severe liver or kidney disease. Esomeprazole should be avoided in case of known allergy to it or other PPIs.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Both levosulpiride and esomeprazole can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a physician, as the risks and benefits need to be carefully evaluated.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.  Dosage adjustments might be necessary.
* **Patients with Liver or Kidney Disease:** Dosage adjustments are crucial for patients with impaired liver or kidney function.
