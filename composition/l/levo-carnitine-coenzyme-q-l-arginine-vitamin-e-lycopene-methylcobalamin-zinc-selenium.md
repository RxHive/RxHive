# Levo-carnitine + Coenzyme Q + L-Arginine + Vitamin E + Lycopene + Methylcobalamin + Zinc + Selenium

**Generic Name:**  There isn't a single generic name for a combination of Levo-carnitine, Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), L-Arginine, Vitamin E, Lycopene, Methylcobalamin, Zinc, and Selenium.  These are all individual nutrients and would be listed separately on a product label, not under one generic name.

**Usage:** The usage of this combination supplement varies greatly depending on the manufacturer's intended purpose and the individual dosages of each ingredient.  Common purported uses include:

* **Energy production and improved athletic performance:** L-carnitine, CoQ10, and L-arginine are often touted for their roles in energy metabolism.
* **Cardiovascular support:** CoQ10, L-arginine, and Vitamin E are sometimes associated with heart health.
* **Antioxidant protection:** Vitamin E, Lycopene, and Selenium are known antioxidants that may protect cells from damage.
* **Male fertility support:** L-carnitine and L-arginine have been researched for their potential benefits in male fertility.
* **Cognitive function:** Methylcobalamin (a form of Vitamin B12) is crucial for nerve function and brain health.  Zinc also plays a role in cognitive processes.

**It's crucial to note:** The effectiveness of this combination for any of these purposes is not definitively proven in robust clinical trials for this specific combination.  Research often focuses on individual nutrients, not this specific blend.

* **L-Carnitine:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, body odor
