# Lidocaine + Tetracaine
### Generic Name
Lidocaine + Tetracaine

### Usage

Lidocaine and tetracaine is a combination of two local anesthetics.  It's primarily used for topical anesthesia, meaning it numbs the area where it's applied to the skin or mucous membranes.  Its main use is to provide temporary pain relief before minor medical procedures. This includes procedures like:

* **Minor surgical procedures:**  Such as biopsies, wound suturing, and dermatological procedures.
* **Dental procedures:**  To numb the gums and mouth before injections or other procedures.
* **Endoscopy:**  To numb the throat and esophagus before endoscopy.
* **Other medical procedures:**  Where temporary numbing of skin or mucous membranes is necessary.


While less common, it might also be used to treat certain types of pain, such as burns or abrasions, although other treatments are often preferred.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions for its use.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation (cream, gel, ointment, solution), the area to be anesthetized, and the patient's age and health status.  There is no standard dosage that applies across the board.  **It is crucial to follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist exactly.**  Self-medicating with this combination can be risky.

**Oral administration is not recommended, and intravenous administration is generally not used with this particular combination.** Lidocaine and tetracaine are almost exclusively used topically.

For topical application, the amount used depends on the size of the area to be treated.  The medication should be applied thinly and evenly to the affected area.  Instructions will typically be included with the specific product you receive.  If you are unsure, consult your doctor or pharmacist.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site. These can include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site (usually temporary)
* Redness or swelling at the application site
* Itching at the application site

Less common, but more serious side effects, though rare with topical application, can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue)
* Systemic absorption (leading to effects throughout the body) - this is more likely with large application areas or compromised skin barriers.  Symptoms might include drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, or slowed heart rate.

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Both lidocaine and tetracaine are local anesthetics. They work by temporarily blocking nerve signals from the treated area to the brain.  This prevents the transmission of pain signals, resulting in a numbing effect.  They achieve this by binding to sodium channels in nerve cells, thus interfering with the transmission of nerve impulses.  The combination of lidocaine and tetracaine often provides a more effective and longer-lasting numbing effect compared to using either drug alone.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have any allergies, especially to local anesthetics, amides or esters.
* **Pregnant or breastfeeding women:** Use only under the guidance of a healthcare professional; the benefits must outweigh potential risks.
* **Children:**  Use should be guided by a healthcare professional due to variations in skin sensitivity and metabolism.
* **Compromised skin:** Use with caution on broken skin, wounds, or irritated areas, as absorption might be increased.
* **Interaction with other drugs:**  Some medications can interact with local anesthetics.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Avoid contact with eyes:**  If accidental contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.
* **Do not exceed recommended dosage:** Applying more than directed will not necessarily provide better results and may increase the risk of side effects.


### FAQs
