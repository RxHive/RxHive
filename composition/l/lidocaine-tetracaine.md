# Lidocaine + Tetracaine

**Generic Name:** Lidocaine and Tetracaine Topical

**Usage:**

Lidocaine and tetracaine topical is a combination of two local anesthetics used to numb the skin or mucous membranes.  Its uses include:

* **Temporary pain relief:**  Before minor medical procedures like injections, minor surgery, or wound care.  It can also relieve pain associated with burns, sunburns, and other minor skin irritations.
* **Anesthesia for diagnostic procedures:**  Such as endoscopy or cystoscopy.
* **Relief from the discomfort of hemorrhoids or other rectal conditions:** Often found in suppositories or creams.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site.  However, more serious, though rare, systemic effects are possible, especially with larger application areas or absorption through damaged skin.  Side effects can include:

* **Common:** Burning, stinging, or tingling at the application site, temporary redness or skin discoloration.
* **Less Common:** Swelling, rash, itching.
* **Rare but Serious:** Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), dizziness, lightheadedness, drowsiness, confusion, slowed heart rate, low blood pressure, breathing difficulties.  These are more likely with larger application areas, damaged skin, or accidental ingestion.


**How it Works:**

Lidocaine and tetracaine are local anesthetics. They work by temporarily blocking nerve signals from the area where they are applied to the brain, thus preventing the transmission of pain sensations. Lidocaine and tetracaine have slightly different mechanisms of action but both achieve the same result: temporary numbness.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?** The onset of numbness varies depending on the concentration and application site but is typically within a few minutes.  The duration of effect also varies but is usually around 30-60 minutes.

* **Can I use it on broken skin?**  Use on broken or severely damaged skin should be avoided as this can increase the risk of systemic absorption and adverse effects.

* **Can I use it with other medications?**  Consult your doctor or pharmacist before using lidocaine and tetracaine topical with other medications, especially other anesthetics or drugs that affect the nervous system or heart.

* **What should I do if I experience a serious side effect?** Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, rapid heartbeat, or severe dizziness.

* **Is it safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Can I use it on children?** Use in children should be under the supervision of a doctor, as the dosage and application method may need to be adjusted.

* **Can I use it more often than directed?**  Do not exceed the recommended dosage or frequency of application.  Overuse can increase the risk of side effects.
