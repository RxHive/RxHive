# Lamivudine + Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate

**Generic Name:** Lamivudine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate

**Usage:**

Lamivudine/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is an antiretroviral medication used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and to prevent HIV infection (pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP) and to treat HIV infection (in combination with other antiretrovirals).  It is *not* a cure for either HIV or HBV, but significantly reduces viral load and improves liver function in HBV patients and helps to prevent or slow the progression of HIV.  The specific usage (HBV treatment, PrEP, or HIV treatment) and dosage will be determined by a physician based on individual factors.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* **Headache:**  Can range from mild to moderate.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired or weak.
* **Muscle aches:**  Pain or discomfort in the muscles.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.

Less common, but more serious side effects, that require immediate medical attention, can include:

* **Lactic acidosis:** A buildup of lactic acid in the blood, potentially leading to serious complications. Symptoms can include fatigue, weakness, muscle pain, stomach pain, nausea, and rapid breathing.
* **Severe liver problems:** Symptoms can include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, and abdominal pain.
* **Kidney problems:**  Changes in kidney function, including decreased urine output.
* **Pancreatitis:** Inflammation of the pancreas, characterized by severe abdominal pain.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:** Nerve damage causing numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet.
* **Bone loss (osteoporosis):**  Increased risk of fractures.
* **Fat redistribution:** Changes in body fat distribution.


This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects vary from person to person. It's crucial to report any unusual or concerning symptoms to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

Lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).  They work by interfering with the ability of HBV and HIV to replicate.  Specifically:

* **Lamivudine:**  Inhibits the HBV and HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme, preventing the virus from converting its RNA into DNA, a necessary step for viral replication.
* **Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate:**  Is a prodrug that's converted to tenofovir, which then inhibits the reverse transcriptase enzyme, similarly preventing viral DNA synthesis.

By inhibiting this crucial step in the viral life cycle, the drugs significantly reduce the amount of virus in the body.


**FAQs:**

* **Is this medication a cure for HIV or HBV?** No, it's not a cure, but it significantly suppresses viral replication, improving health outcomes.  Consistent treatment is crucial for long-term management.

* **Can I take this medication with other drugs?**  It's essential to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbs, and supplements, as interactions can occur.

* **What are the potential long-term effects?** Long-term use may increase the risk of bone loss, kidney problems, and lactic acidosis. Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is vital.

* **How is the medication taken?**  Dosage and frequency are determined by a physician and vary based on the condition being treated. It's typically taken orally.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance; do not simply double up on the next dose.

* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?**  Signs might include rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any allergic reaction.
