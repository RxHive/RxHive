# Liposomal Dithranol
### Generic Name
Liposomal Dithranol

### Usage
Liposomal dithranol is primarily used in the treatment of psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by red, scaly patches.  It's particularly beneficial for plaque psoriasis, the most common type.  While primarily targeted at psoriasis, some studies suggest potential in treating other skin conditions with hyperproliferation (excessive skin cell growth), although further research is needed to confirm its efficacy in these areas. The liposomal formulation is designed to improve dithranol's delivery to the skin, minimizing irritation compared to traditional dithranol preparations.


### Dosage
Dosage of liposomal dithranol is highly individualized and determined by a dermatologist based on the severity of the psoriasis, the patient's skin sensitivity, and their response to treatment.  There's no standardized dosage across all patients.

* **Adults:** Treatment typically begins with a low concentration applied to a small area of affected skin for a short period.  The concentration and treatment duration are gradually increased as tolerated, under the close supervision of a healthcare professional.  This titration process aims to find the optimal balance between efficacy and minimizing irritation.  The frequency of application can also vary.  Specific instructions will be provided by the prescribing physician. Oral or IV administration of liposomal dithranol is not currently established.

* **Children:**  The use of liposomal dithranol in children is generally not recommended due to limited clinical data on safety and efficacy in this population.  A dermatologist will assess the risks and benefits carefully before considering its use in a child.

* **Forms:** Liposomal dithranol is typically available as a cream or ointment for topical application.

* **Administration:**  Apply a thin layer of the cream or ointment to the affected area of skin, avoiding healthy skin. Wash hands thoroughly after application.  Follow the instructions provided by your dermatologist precisely.


### Side Effects
* **Common Side Effects:** Skin irritation (redness, burning, itching), dryness, peeling.  These are often manageable by adjusting the dosage or frequency of application.

* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Severe skin reactions (blistering, swelling), allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing).  Contact a healthcare provider immediately if you experience any of these.

* **Important Note:** The side effects can vary depending on the concentration of dithranol and individual sensitivity.  Always inform your dermatologist about any adverse reactions.


### How it Works
Liposomal dithranol works by inhibiting the rapid growth of skin cells characteristic of psoriasis.  The liposomal formulation encapsulates dithranol, improving its delivery to the skin cells where it's needed.  This targeted delivery reduces the likelihood of irritation compared to traditional dithranol preparations.  The exact mechanism by which dithranol slows cell growth isn't fully understood, but it's thought to involve interference with DNA synthesis and cell division.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Liposomal dithranol should not be used on broken or infected skin.  Individuals with known hypersensitivity to dithranol should avoid using this medication.

* **Drug Interactions:**  There are no known significant interactions with other drugs, but inform your dermatologist about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of liposomal dithranol during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your dermatologist about the risks and benefits before using this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

* **Other Precautions:** Avoid sun exposure to treated areas.  Use caution when applying near the eyes or mucous membranes.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The time it takes to see improvement varies greatly depending on the severity of psoriasis and individual response.  Improvements may be noticeable within a few weeks, but consistent treatment is usually needed for sustained benefits.

* **Q: Can I use other topical treatments alongside liposomal dithranol?** A:  Discuss with your dermatologist before combining liposomal dithranol with other topical treatments for psoriasis to avoid potential interactions or adverse reactions.

* **Q: How should I store liposomal dithranol?** A:  Store according to the instructions on the product label.  Generally, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Apply the next dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Is liposomal dithranol addictive?** A:  No, liposomal dithranol is not considered addictive.
