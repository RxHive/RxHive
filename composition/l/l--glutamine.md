# L- glutamine
### Generic Name
L-Glutamine

### Usage
L-glutamine is a non-essential amino acid. While the body can typically produce it, supplementation is sometimes used to support gut health and wound healing.  It's primarily used as a dietary supplement, particularly by athletes and individuals experiencing conditions that impair glutamine production or increase its demand.  Secondary uses are under ongoing research.


### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the reason for supplementation and individual needs.  There isn't a universally established therapeutic dose like with many pharmaceuticals.

* **Adults:** For general supplementation, oral doses of 3-6 grams per day are commonly suggested. However, higher doses might be considered in specific circumstances under medical supervision.  Dosage exceeding 14g/day is considered unsafe in healthy adults.

* **Children:**  Oral dosages for children are typically calculated based on weight, up to 0.7 g/kg per day.  Precise dosing for children should always be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Important Note:**  The information above is for general knowledge only. The appropriate dose of L-glutamine should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and health status.


### Side Effects
While generally considered safe at recommended doses, L-glutamine can cause some side effects in certain individuals.  These can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Joint pain
* Hives

Serious side effects are rare but possible.  Any significant or concerning side effects should be reported immediately to a healthcare professional.


### How it Works
L-glutamine is a crucial fuel source for cells lining the intestines. It plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity of the gut barrier, which is essential for preventing the leakage of harmful substances into the bloodstream.  During periods of stress or illness (catabolic states), the body may have a heightened demand for glutamine, potentially leading to intestinal permeability.  Supplementing with L-glutamine may help to maintain or restore the gut's barrier function.  Its role in wound healing is linked to its contribution to protein synthesis and cellular repair processes.


### Precautions
* **Liver and Kidney Impairment:** L-glutamine should be avoided or used with extreme caution in individuals with liver or kidney disease.  Its metabolism is significantly impacted by these organs' functions.

* **Seizure Disorders:**  L-glutamine should be used cautiously in individuals with seizure disorders, as some evidence suggests potential interactions.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Avoid L-glutamine supplementation during pregnancy and breastfeeding, as there is insufficient data on its safety during these periods.

* **Drug Interactions:** Although not extensively studied, the potential for interactions with other medications exists. Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications.

* **High Doses:** Exceeding recommended dosages may lead to increased risk of side effects.  Always follow the guidance of a healthcare professional.
