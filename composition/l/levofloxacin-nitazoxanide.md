# Levofloxacin + Nitazoxanide
### Generic Name: Levofloxacin + Nitazoxanide (Combination Therapy)


**Note:**  A fixed-dose combination of Levofloxacin and Nitazoxanide is not a standard, commercially available medication.  Levofloxacin and Nitazoxanide are often prescribed separately, and their combined use would be at the discretion of a physician based on a specific patient's needs and clinical situation. This information describes each drug individually and discusses the potential rationale for their combined use, but it does *not* represent a standard treatment regimen.  Always consult a healthcare professional before taking any medication.


### Usage

**Levofloxacin:** This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic effective against a wide range of bacteria. It's primarily used to treat bacterial infections of the respiratory tract (pneumonia, bronchitis), urinary tract (cystitis, pyelonephritis), skin and soft tissues, and bones and joints.  It's also sometimes used for certain types of abdominal infections and certain eye infections.

**Nitazoxanide:** This is an antiprotozoal and antiviral drug.  Its primary use is in treating intestinal infections caused by parasites such as *Cryptosporidium parvum*, *Giardia lamblia*, and *Entamoeba histolytica*.  It also shows activity against certain viruses, though its antiviral use is less established.


**Combined Use Rationale:** A doctor might consider using Levofloxacin and Nitazoxanide together in cases where a patient presents with a mixed infection â€“ a bacterial infection alongside a parasitic or viral infection. For example, a severe diarrheal illness could potentially involve both a bacterial cause requiring an antibiotic like Levofloxacin and a parasitic component requiring Nitazoxanide. This combination therapy would need careful consideration and monitoring by a physician.


### Dosage

**Levofloxacin:** Dosage varies greatly depending on the infection being treated, the patient's age, weight, and kidney function.  Oral dosages range from 250mg to 750mg once or twice daily. IV dosages are generally higher and adjusted based on the severity of the infection and renal function. Pediatric dosages are significantly lower and require careful calculation by a healthcare professional.  Always follow your doctor's prescription precisely.

**Nitazoxanide:**  Dosages also depend on the infection and the patient's age and weight. The usual adult oral dosage is 500mg twice daily for several days.  Pediatric dosing is lower and must be determined by a physician based on the child's weight.


### Side Effects

**Levofloxacin:**

* Common: Nausea, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, insomnia
* Less Common but Serious: Tendonitis, tendon rupture (especially in older adults), peripheral neuropathy, seizures,  QT prolongation (heart rhythm disturbance), allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis).

**Nitazoxanide:**

* Common: Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache
* Less Common:  Elevated liver enzymes


**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list. Consult a healthcare professional if you experience any adverse effects.


### How it Works

**Levofloxacin:**  Inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, essential enzymes for bacterial DNA replication and repair. This action prevents bacterial growth and leads to bacterial cell death.

**Nitazoxanide:** The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to interfere with several essential metabolic pathways in parasites and viruses, leading to their inactivation or death.


### Precautions

**Levofloxacin:**

* Contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones.
* Use cautiously in patients with epilepsy, myasthenia gravis, or a history of tendon problems.
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Use only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Consult your doctor.
* Interaction with other drugs:  Levofloxacin can interact with many medications, including antacids, blood thinners, and some heart medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

**Nitazoxanide:**

* Use cautiously in patients with liver disease.
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Use should be carefully considered. Consult your doctor.
*  Information regarding drug interactions is relatively limited compared to Levofloxacin. However, it is crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.


### FAQs
