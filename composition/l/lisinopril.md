# Lisinopril
### Generic Name
Lisinopril

### Usage
Lisinopril is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults and children aged 6 years and older.  It's a type of medication called an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.  Beyond hypertension, lisinopril also plays a significant role in managing heart failure (specifically, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction), and in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).  While not its primary indication, lisinopril is sometimes used off-label in conditions like post-transplant erythrocytosis (in renal transplant recipients) and proteinuric chronic kidney disease (both diabetic and non-diabetic).  Off-label uses should only be considered under the strict guidance of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the individual's response.  It's always administered orally.

* **Hypertension:**  The initial dose is typically 5-10 mg once daily.  The dose may be increased gradually (in increments) up to a maximum of 40 mg once daily, based on the patient's response and blood pressure readings.  Adjustments are typically made every 4-6 weeks.

* **Heart Failure (reduced ejection fraction):**  The starting dose is lower, usually 2.5-5 mg once daily, gradually increasing to a target dose of 40 mg once daily, as tolerated.  Increases are made in smaller steps (no more than 10 mg) every 1-2 weeks.  In hospitalized patients, adjustments might happen more frequently (1-2 day intervals).

* **Acute Coronary Syndrome (heart attack):** This requires careful monitoring.  The initial dose for ST-elevation myocardial infarction is 2.5-5 mg once daily, starting within 24 hours of the event.  The dose is then increased slowly to avoid dangerously low blood pressure.

* **Off-label uses (post-transplant erythrocytosis, proteinuric chronic kidney disease):**  These also start with lower doses (2.5-10 mg once daily), and titration is guided by specific lab results (e.g., hemoglobin levels, proteinuria).

**Pediatric Dosage:** Lisinopril is used for hypertension in children 6 years and older. Dosages are calculated based on the child's weight in mg/kg/day.  Specific dosing information should be obtained from a healthcare professional.  For proteinuria in children 2 years and older, different weight-based dosing schemes apply.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Kidney function significantly influences lisinopril dosage.  Patients with reduced kidney function require lower starting doses and slower increases.  Liver function does not typically require dosage adjustments, but careful monitoring is advised.  Dialysis patients need specific dosage considerations.  Always consult with a doctor or pharmacist for proper dosage guidance based on individual health conditions.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Dry cough
* Changes in taste
* Nausea

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat â€“ seek immediate medical attention)
* High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Acute kidney injury
* Skin rashes (some severe)
* Changes in blood cell counts


If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Lisinopril works by blocking the action of an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).  ACE plays a role in raising blood pressure by constricting blood vessels.  By inhibiting ACE, lisinopril prevents the formation of a substance called angiotensin II, which causes blood vessels to narrow.  This results in widening of blood vessels, lowering blood pressure, and reducing the strain on the heart.  It also helps reduce fluid retention.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Lisinopril is contraindicated in individuals with a history of angioedema (swelling) related to ACE inhibitors, hereditary angioedema, or those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.  It should also be avoided with certain other medications (see interactions).

* **Interactions:**  Lisinopril can interact with many other medications, including diuretics, potassium supplements, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and other blood pressure medications.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with impaired kidney or liver function, heart valve problems (aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), and those undergoing dialysis.  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.  Monitor blood pressure and kidney function regularly while taking lisinopril.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking lisinopril suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping lisinopril can be harmful.  Always taper off the medication under your doctor's supervision.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store lisinopril?** A: Store lisinopril at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Is lisinopril safe for pregnant women?** A: No, lisinopril is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of serious harm to the developing fetus.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking lisinopril?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol can lower blood pressure further, potentially leading to dizziness or fainting.  It's best to discuss this with your doctor.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience a severe allergic reaction (angioedema)?** A: Seek immediate medical attention. Angioedema is a serious, potentially life-threatening reaction.
