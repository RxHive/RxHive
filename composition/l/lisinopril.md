# Lisinopril

**Generic Name:** Lisinopril

**Usage:**

Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used to treat:

* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  It helps lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney disease.
* **Heart failure:** It helps improve the heart's ability to pump blood and reduces symptoms.
* **After a heart attack:** It helps reduce the risk of death and further heart problems.
* **Diabetic kidney disease:** It helps slow the progression of kidney damage in people with diabetes.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Dizziness or lightheadedness:** Especially common when starting the medication or increasing the dose.
* **Dry cough:** A persistent, dry cough is a relatively common side effect and may require a change of medication.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Muscle cramps or pain:**
* **Changes in taste:**  May describe a metallic taste.


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Angioedema:** Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, which can be life-threatening. Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* **High potassium levels (hyperkalemia):**  Can be dangerous, especially for those with kidney problems.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** Can cause dizziness or fainting.
* **Kidney problems:** Worsening of existing kidney disease.
* **Liver problems:**  Rare, but can be serious.


**How it Works:**

Lisinopril works by blocking the action of an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE normally converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor (a substance that narrows blood vessels). By blocking ACE, lisinopril prevents the formation of angiotensin II, causing blood vessels to relax and widen. This lowers blood pressure and reduces the workload on the heart.  The reduction in blood pressure also helps protect the kidneys and heart.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I take lisinopril with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, you are taking.  Some medications can interact with lisinopril.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.
* **How long does it take to work?**  It may take several weeks to see the full effect of lisinopril on blood pressure.
* **Can I stop taking lisinopril suddenly?**  No, stopping lisinopril suddenly can be dangerous.  Your doctor should help you gradually reduce your dose if you need to discontinue the medication.
* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?**  Signs of an allergic reaction can include rash, hives, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, and dizziness. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms.
* **Can lisinopril cause weight gain?** While weight gain isn't a common side effect, some individuals may experience fluid retention which can contribute to weight changes.  This should be discussed with your physician.
* **Is lisinopril safe during pregnancy?** Lisinopril is generally not recommended during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters. Consult your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
