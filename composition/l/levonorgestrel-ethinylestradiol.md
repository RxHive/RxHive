# Levonorgestrel + Ethinylestradiol
### Generic Name
Levonorgestrel + Ethinyl estradiol

### Usage
Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is a combination hormonal contraceptive used primarily to prevent pregnancy in females of reproductive age.  It's a combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing a progestin (levonorgestrel) and an estrogen (ethinyl estradiol).  This combination works by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg), thickening cervical mucus (making it harder for sperm to reach the egg), and altering the uterine lining (making it less receptive to a fertilized egg).  

Beyond its primary contraceptive use, it can also be used off-label as emergency contraception (the "morning-after pill") following unprotected sex.  However,  it's crucial to understand that emergency contraception is less effective than regular, consistent use of hormonal contraceptives for preventing pregnancy.  This combination is not intended for use in postmenopausal women.  The transdermal patch formulation is specifically indicated for women with a BMI under 30 kg/m².

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the formulation (oral tablets or transdermal patch) and the intended use (regular contraception or emergency contraception).

**Regular Contraception (Oral):**  Dosage regimens vary depending on the specific brand and the chosen starting schedule (Sunday start or Day 1 start). Generally, one tablet is taken daily at the same time each day.  The exact schedule and instructions for starting should be followed as directed on the product label.  A backup non-hormonal contraceptive method may be necessary for the first 7 days of the first cycle depending on the starting schedule.

**Regular Contraception (Transdermal Patch):** One patch is applied weekly for three weeks, followed by a patch-free week. The patch should be applied on the same day each week. For women not currently on hormonal contraception, the first patch is applied within the first 24 hours of their menstrual period.  If applied later, a non-hormonal backup method should be used for the first 7 days of the cycle.

**Emergency Contraception (Oral):** This is an off-label use.  Typically, two doses of a combination oral contraceptive pill containing at least 0.5 mg levonorgestrel and 100 mcg ethinyl estradiol are taken, 12 hours apart.  This should be done as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse, but it's still somewhat effective up to 5 days after.  Note that specific pill combinations will need to be used to achieve this specific dosage and this should be done under the guidance of a doctor.

**Pediatric Use:** Safety and effectiveness have only been established in females of reproductive potential.  It is not intended for use before menarche (the onset of menstruation).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  This medication is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment. Renal impairment does not necessitate a specific dosage adjustment, but close monitoring of blood pressure is advised.  Switching from other contraceptive methods requires specific instructions, depending on the previous method used. Consult a healthcare professional for detailed guidance on transitioning.

### How it Works
Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol works by combining the actions of a progestin (levonorgestrel) and an estrogen (ethinyl estradiol).  This combination primarily prevents pregnancy by suppressing ovulation.  It also thickens cervical mucus to impede sperm passage and alters the uterine lining to reduce the likelihood of implantation.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with a history of breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive cancers, liver tumors, undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding, current pregnancy, and those currently using specific hepatitis C drug combinations.  It's also contraindicated in women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² using the transdermal patch formulation. The use of this medicine is contraindicated in women with a history or current presence of any of the following: uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disease (e.g. coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease), hypercoagulopathies (inherited or acquired), and thromboembolic disorders.  Women over 35 who smoke are at increased risk of serious cardiovascular events and should not use this medication.

**Drug Interactions:**  Several medications can interact with levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol, potentially reducing its effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  Discuss all medications, including herbal supplements, with your healthcare provider before starting this medication.

**Warnings:**  This medication does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV.  Regular monitoring of blood pressure and weight are recommended.  Women with diabetes, migraines, or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be closely monitored.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not use this medication; there are different contraceptive options suitable for this population.
