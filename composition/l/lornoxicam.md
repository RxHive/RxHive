# Lornoxicam
### Generic Name
Lornoxicam

### Usage
Lornoxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and inflammation.  Its primary uses are in managing the symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  It's also effective for relieving acute mild-to-moderate pain, including back pain and postoperative pain (for example, after dental surgery).

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis (Oral):** The initial dose is typically 12 mg per day, divided into 2-3 doses. The maximum daily dose is 16 mg.

* **Pain (Intramuscular or Intravenous):**  An initial dose of 8 mg is given as a single injection. Up to two additional 8 mg doses may be administered within the first 24 hours if needed. The maximum dose within the first 24 hours is 24 mg, after which the daily dose should be reduced to a maximum of 16 mg.  Intramuscular or intravenous use should be limited to a maximum of 2 days.  Oral therapy should be considered if longer treatment is necessary.

* **Pain (Oral):**  The dose ranges from 8 to 16 mg per day, divided into 2-3 doses. The maximum daily dose remains 16 mg.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of lornoxicam in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are often necessary for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.  For mild-to-moderate hepatic or renal impairment, the manufacturerâ€™s labeling may not provide specific dosage reductions, but a healthcare provider might recommend a lower dose.  Lornoxicam is contraindicated in cases of severe hepatic or renal impairment.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance.

### How it Works

Lornoxicam is an NSAID that works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, substances that contribute to inflammation and pain. By reducing prostaglandin production, lornoxicam helps to alleviate both pain and inflammation.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Lornoxicam is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to lornoxicam or other NSAIDs, thrombocytopenia, uncontrolled heart failure, active gastrointestinal bleeding, or severe liver or kidney disease.  It is also contraindicated during pregnancy and in children.

* **Interactions:** Lornoxicam may interact with several other medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and other NSAIDs.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Lornoxicam, like other NSAIDs, carries risks of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal complications. Patients with a history of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, or ulcers should use it with caution.  Elderly patients and those with impaired renal or hepatic function are also at increased risk for adverse effects.  The risk of infertility and miscarriage is also increased with chronic NSAID use.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Lornoxicam is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Its excretion into breast milk is unknown, and breastfeeding is not recommended during use.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I take lornoxicam?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your condition and your doctor's recommendations. For acute pain, it may be short-term; for chronic conditions like arthritis, it might be longer-term, but regular monitoring is necessary.

* **Q: Can I take lornoxicam with alcohol?** A: Combining lornoxicam with alcohol may increase the risk of stomach upset and bleeding.  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.

* **Q: How should I store lornoxicam?** A: Store lornoxicam in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as directed on the product label.
