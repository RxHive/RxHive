# Lornoxicam

**Generic Name:** Lornoxicam

**Usage:** Lornoxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  It's also used to treat acute pain, such as that associated with dental procedures or musculoskeletal injuries.  It's available in various formulations, including tablets and injections.  The specific usage and dosage will depend on the individual's condition and the prescribing doctor's instructions.

**Side Effects:**  Like other NSAIDs, lornoxicam can cause several side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially serious.

* **Common Side Effects:** These may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and heartburn.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are more likely with higher doses or prolonged use and include:
    * **Gastrointestinal problems:**  Ulcers, bleeding, or perforation (hole) in the stomach or intestines.  This is a particularly serious risk for individuals with a history of ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding.
    * **Cardiovascular problems:** Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and high blood pressure.  This risk is increased with higher doses and longer duration of use.
    * **Kidney problems:**  Reduced kidney function, especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney disease or dehydration.
    * **Liver problems:**  Elevated liver enzymes.
    * **Allergic reactions:**  Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.  These are rare but can be life-threatening.
    * **Increased risk of bleeding:**  Lornoxicam can interfere with blood clotting, increasing the risk of bleeding, particularly in individuals taking anticoagulants (blood thinners).


**How it Works:** Lornoxicam works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are substances in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever.  By reducing prostaglandin production, lornoxicam helps to alleviate these symptoms.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take lornoxicam with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins, as interactions can occur.  Some medications, especially anticoagulants, should not be combined with lornoxicam without medical supervision.
* **Q: How long can I take lornoxicam?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the condition being treated and should be determined by your doctor.  Long-term use should be carefully monitored due to the potential for side effects.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking lornoxicam?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking lornoxicam, as it can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and other side effects.
* **Q: Is lornoxicam safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A:  Lornoxicam should generally be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless specifically prescribed by a doctor, due to potential risks to the baby.
