# Lindane

**Generic Name:** Lindane

**Usage:** Lindane is an insecticide, historically used to treat lice infestations (pediculosis) and scabies.  **However, its use is now extremely limited due to significant safety concerns.**  In many countries, it's no longer available for over-the-counter purchase or prescription for these conditions, having been largely replaced by safer alternatives.  Its continued use is primarily restricted to veterinary applications in some regions.

**Side Effects:**  Lindane's side effects can be serious and range from mild to severe.  These can include:

* **Nervous system effects:** These are the most concerning and can range from mild dizziness and headache to seizures, tremors, and coma, especially in individuals with pre-existing neurological conditions or after applying large amounts.
* **Skin irritation:**  Burning, itching, and rash at the application site are common.
* **Hair loss:**  Lindane can cause temporary or permanent hair loss.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Skin reactions ranging from mild redness to severe allergic reactions are possible.
* **Systemic absorption:** Lindane can be absorbed through the skin, leading to the potential for widespread side effects, particularly in infants and young children.


**How it Works:** Lindane is a neurotoxin. It works by disrupting the function of the central nervous system in insects, leading to their paralysis and death. In humans, this same mechanism is the source of its toxicity.  It interferes with the chloride ion channels in nerve cells.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Lindane still used?**  Its use is drastically reduced due to safety concerns and the availability of safer alternatives.  Its use is largely restricted to specific veterinary applications and may not be available at all in many regions.
* **Is Lindane safe for children?** No, Lindane is particularly dangerous for infants and young children due to their increased susceptibility to systemic absorption and neurological effects.  It should absolutely *never* be used on children.
