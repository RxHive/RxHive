# Lindane
### Generic Name
Lindane

### Usage
Lindane is an antiparasitic medication used topically to treat infestations caused by:

*   **Scabies:**  Infestation by the mite *Sarcoptes scabiei*.  Lindane effectively kills the mites, relieving the intense itching and rash characteristic of scabies.
*   **Head lice:** Infestation by *Pediculus humanus capitis*.  It eliminates head lice and their eggs (nits).
*   **Pubic lice (crab lice):** Infestation by *Pthirus pubis*. Lindane effectively treats this type of lice infestation.

It's crucial to understand that Lindane is generally considered a second-line treatment option for these conditions.  Safer and less toxic alternatives are usually preferred as first-line therapies.  A healthcare professional will determine if Lindane is the appropriate choice based on individual circumstances and the failure of other treatments.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Lindane's use in children, especially those under 50 kg (approximately 110 lbs), is strongly discouraged due to the risk of serious side effects.  Alternative treatments are strongly recommended for children.

**Adults:**

*   **Scabies:**
    *   **Cream (1%):** Apply a thin layer to dry skin from the neck down to the toes. Leave on for 6-12 hours, then bathe and thoroughly wash off the medication.  Do not exceed 12 hours of application.  (CDC guidelines recommend 8 hours).  A single application is typically sufficient.
    *   **Lotion (1%):** Apply a thin layer to dry skin from the neck down to the toes. Leave on for 8-12 hours, then bathe and thoroughly wash off the medication. Do not exceed 12 hours of application.  Most adults will need 30 mL, some may require up to 60 mL. A single application is typically sufficient.

*   **Head lice & Pubic lice:**
    *   **Shampoo (1%):** Apply to dry hair and massage into the hair for 4 minutes. Add small amounts of water to create a lather, then rinse thoroughly.  Comb hair with a fine-toothed comb to remove nits. The amount needed depends on hair length and thickness; most will require â‰¤30 mL (maximum 60 mL). A single application is typically sufficient.
    *   **Cream (1% for head lice):** Apply to dry hair, leave on for 3-5 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. A single application is usually sufficient.


**Children:**

Lindane should be used with extreme caution in children and only when other treatments have failed.  Dosage is similar to adults but the maximum amount should be strictly adhered to, and treatment duration should not exceed the recommended time.  A healthcare provider should closely monitor children treated with Lindane.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common:**

*   Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
*   Dizziness
*   Restlessness
*   Ataxia (lack of muscle coordination)


**Serious (Less Common but Potentially Life-Threatening):**

*   Seizures
*   Neurotoxicity (especially in children and those under 50kg)
*   Aplastic anemia (rare but severe blood disorder)
*   Allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives)

**Any unusual or concerning side effects require immediate medical attention.**

### How it Works
Lindane is a neurotoxin that works by interfering with the nervous system of the parasites. It's absorbed through the exoskeleton of lice and mites, causing their paralysis and death.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:**  Lindane is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to Lindane or any formulation component, premature infants, uncontrolled seizure disorders, and those with crusted scabies or other skin conditions (like atopic dermatitis or psoriasis) that may increase systemic absorption.
*   **Increased Risk:**  Individuals with a history of seizures, head trauma, or HIV infection,  the elderly, infants, small children, and those weighing less than 50 kg (approximately 110 lbs) are at increased risk for neurotoxicity.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Lindane is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. Its use during pregnancy carries risks, including potential harm to the fetus.  It's excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding should be interrupted for at least 24 hours following application, and expressed milk should be discarded.
*   **Drug Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known, but it's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
*   **Application:** Always follow the instructions carefully. Apply only to the affected area(s). Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Wash hands thoroughly after application.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take for Lindane to work?** A:  Usually, a single application is sufficient to kill the parasites. However, symptom relief (e.g., itching) may take a few days to a week.

*   **Q: Can I reapply Lindane?** A: No, reapplication is strongly discouraged due to the increased risk of toxicity.

*   **Q: How should I store Lindane?** A: Store Lindane in a cool, dry place, away from children and pets.

*   **Q: What should I do if I accidentally ingest Lindane?** A:  Contact poison control or your doctor immediately.

*   **Q: Are there any alternative treatments for lice or scabies?** A: Yes, several safer and equally effective alternative treatments are available. Consult your doctor to discuss appropriate options.
