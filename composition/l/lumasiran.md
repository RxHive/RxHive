# Lumasiran
### Generic Name
Lumasiran

### Usage
Lumasiran is a medication specifically designed to treat primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1).  This is a rare inherited disorder where the body produces excessive amounts of oxalate, a chemical that can form kidney stones and eventually lead to kidney failure. Lumasiran works to lower the levels of oxalate in the urine, thereby reducing the risk of kidney damage associated with PH1.  It's currently approved for use in both pediatric and adult patients.

### Dosage
Lumasiran is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) by a healthcare professional.  The dosage is individualized and depends on the patient's weight and age.

**Adults with PH1:**

* **Loading Dose:** 3 mg/kg/dose once monthly for three doses.
* **Maintenance Dose:** 3 mg/kg/dose every three months, starting one month after the last loading dose.

**Pediatric Patients with PH1:**

Dosage is based on weight:

* **Under 10 kg:**
    * **Loading Dose:** 6 mg/kg/dose once monthly for three doses.
    * **Maintenance Dose:** 3 mg/kg/dose once monthly, starting one month after the last loading dose.
* **10 to under 20 kg:**
    * **Loading Dose:** 6 mg/kg/dose once monthly for three doses.
    * **Maintenance Dose:** 6 mg/kg/dose every three months, starting one month after the last loading dose.
* **20 kg and over:**  The same dosage as adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (liver problems), no dosage adjustment is needed.  Dosage adjustments for severe hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment (kidney problems), or those undergoing hemodialysis are not specified in current prescribing information.  Always consult a physician for appropriate dosing in these cases.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of Lumasiran include:

* Injection site pruritus (itching)
* Abdominal pain
* Injection site reactions (redness, pain, swelling)

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include the development of antibodies against Lumasiran.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Lumasiran is a type of RNA interference (RNAi) therapy. It works by targeting a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule called hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAO1) in the liver. HAO1 is involved in the production of glyoxylate, a precursor to oxalate. By silencing HAO1, Lumasiran reduces glyoxylate production, leading to lower oxalate levels in the urine and subsequently lessening the burden on the kidneys.

### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** There is limited data on Lumasiran's use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Healthcare providers should carefully weigh the benefits and risks before prescribing it to pregnant or breastfeeding women.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** While no dosage adjustment is currently recommended for mild to moderate hepatic impairment,  patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment should be monitored closely.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Individuals with known hypersensitivity to Lumasiran or its components should avoid using it.
* **Antibody Development:**  There's a potential for the development of antibodies against Lumasiran, which could affect its effectiveness.  Monitoring for this is important.
* **Injection Site Reactions:** Carefully follow injection guidelines to minimize the risk of injection site reactions.
