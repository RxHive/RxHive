# Lamivudine + Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + Nevirapine

**Generic Name:** Lamivudine + Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + Nevirapine

**Usage:** This fixed-dose combination is a medication used to treat HIV-1 infection in adults and children (weight and age restrictions apply; consult a healthcare professional).  It is typically part of a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimen, and *should not be used as monotherapy*.  Its use may be appropriate for first-line treatment of HIV-1 in specific situations, determined by the healthcare provider,  based on factors such as viral load, CD4 cell count, resistance testing and patient factors.  The specific formulation and dosage will be determined by a healthcare professional.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* **Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, peripheral neuropathy (tingling, numbness in extremities)
* **Skin:** Rash, itching
* **Metabolic:**  Increased triglycerides and cholesterol, lactic acidosis (rare but serious),  fat redistribution (lipodystrophy)
* **Renal:**  Tenofovir can affect kidney function; regular monitoring is needed.
* **Hepatic:**  Elevated liver enzymes are possible; liver function tests are necessary.
* **Hematological:**  Decreased blood cell counts (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)


**Serious side effects requiring immediate medical attention:**  Lactic acidosis, severe rash, severe liver problems (hepatitis),  kidney problems,  significant changes in blood cell counts.  This list is not exhaustive; consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list.


**How it Works:** This combination medication works by targeting different stages of the HIV-1 lifecycle.

* **Lamivudine:**  A nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that blocks the HIV enzyme reverse transcriptase, preventing the virus from replicating.
* **Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate:**  A nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI), similar to lamivudine in mechanism, also blocking reverse transcriptase.
* **Nevirapine:** A non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) that binds to a different site on reverse transcriptase than lamivudine and tenofovir, inhibiting viral replication through a different mechanism.  This combination of different drug classes provides broader antiviral activity and helps to reduce the development of drug resistance.

By using three different classes of antiretrovirals acting on different steps in the HIV replication cycle, this combination therapy significantly reduces the viral load and improves CD4 cell counts, slowing the progression of HIV infection.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I take this medication with other medicines?** You must discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your doctor. Some interactions can be dangerous.
* **How often should I have blood tests?** Your doctor will schedule regular blood tests to monitor your viral load, CD4 cell count, and kidney and liver function.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Excessive alcohol consumption can negatively impact liver function, which should already be monitored while on this medication.  Consult your doctor for advice.
* **What are the long-term effects?** Long-term effects can vary, including potential for kidney and liver damage and metabolic changes. Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is crucial.
* **Is this medication a cure for HIV?** No, this medication does not cure HIV but significantly reduces the viral load and helps improve the patient's quality of life and life expectancy.
