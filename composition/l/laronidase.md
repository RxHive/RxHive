# Laronidase
### Generic Name
Laronidase

### Usage
Laronidase is a prescription enzyme replacement therapy used to treat mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), also known as Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome, and Scheie syndrome.  It's specifically indicated for patients with the Hurler and Hurler-Scheie forms of MPS I, and for those with the Scheie form who exhibit moderate to severe symptoms.  The primary goal is to help manage the symptoms associated with the buildup of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the body, which is the hallmark of MPS I. While laronidase can improve certain aspects of the disease, like pulmonary function and walking ability, its impact on central nervous system manifestations hasn't been fully established.

### Dosage
Laronidase is administered intravenously (IV) weekly.  The dosage is typically 0.58 mg/kg of body weight, infused over 3-4 hours.  The infusion rate begins at 10 mcg/kg/h and may be increased every 15 minutes during the first hour, as tolerated, up to a maximum of 200 mcg/kg/h.  The total infusion volume is usually 100 mL for patients weighing less than 20 kg and 250 mL for those weighing more than 20 kg.  For patients under 30kg with compromised cardiac or respiratory function, a reduced volume (100 mL normal saline) and slower infusion rate may be considered.  Premedication with antipyretics (fever reducers) and/or antihistamines one hour before the infusion is often recommended.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling. The dosage is the same for infants aged 6 months and older, children, and adolescents.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

*   Cardiovascular: Flushing, venous irritation (often related to poor venous access)
*   Nervous system: Chills, hyperreflexia (overactive reflexes), paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
*   Dermatologic: Skin rash
*   Immunologic: Development of anti-laronidase antibodies (the body's immune system reacting to the medication)
*   Local: Injection site reaction
*   Otic: Otitis media (middle ear infection)
*   Respiratory: Upper respiratory tract infection
*   Others: Infusion-related reactions (like fever)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less, including post-marketing reports):**

*   Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
*   Corneal opacity
*   Chest pain
*   Facial edema (swelling)
*   Gravitational edema (swelling in lower extremities)
*   Injection site pain
*   Hyperbilirubinemia (high bilirubin levels)
*   Hypotension (low blood pressure)
*   Anaphylactic shock
*   Laryngeal edema (swelling of the larynx)
*   Fatigue
*   Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
*   Erythema (redness)
*   Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin)
*   Angioedema (swelling of the skin and mucous membranes)
*   Cardiac failure
*   Pneumonia
*   Respiratory failure


Any significant side effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Laronidase is a recombinant (man-made) form of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase.  In individuals with MPS I, this enzyme is deficient or missing, leading to a build-up of GAGs (glycosaminoglycans) within cells.  Laronidase works by replacing the missing or deficient enzyme. This allows for the breakdown and removal of the accumulated GAGs, thus helping to alleviate the symptoms of MPS I. The improved breakdown of GAGs contributes to improvements seen in pulmonary function and mobility in affected individuals.


### Precautions
* **Contraindication:** Laronidase is contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity to laronidase or related compounds.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients may have an increased risk of hypersensitivity/anaphylactoid reactions (including airway obstruction, bradycardia, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypoxia, respiratory distress/failure, stridor, tachypnea, and urticaria) and infusion reactions.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with sleep apnea, those at risk for fluid overload, or in situations requiring fluid restriction (e.g., acute respiratory illness, compromised cardiac/respiratory function). It's not indicated for the treatment of the central nervous system manifestations of MPS I and should be used with caution in patients with mild symptoms of the Scheie form of MPS I.
* **Boxed Warning:** There is a risk of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction).  Emergency treatment for hypersensitivity reactions should be readily available during administration. Patients with compromised respiratory function or acute respiratory disease may be at increased risk for an acute exacerbation of respiratory symptoms due to infusion reactions.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is laronidase stored?** A:  The diluted solution should be used immediately.  If not used immediately, it should be refrigerated at 2째C to 8째C (36째F to 46째F) for up to 36 hours.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately to determine the best course of action.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A:  Consult your doctor about any other medications you are taking, as interactions are possible.

* **Q:  Can laronidase be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: Laronidase is a Category B drug in pregnancy (animal studies have not shown risk, but human studies are lacking). Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, hence use during breastfeeding should be approached with caution and under medical supervision.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
