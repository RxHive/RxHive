# Levocetirizine + Paracetamol

**Generic Name:** Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride + Paracetamol

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, allergies, and other upper respiratory infections.  Specifically, it targets:

* **Sneezing:** Levocetirizine addresses allergic sneezing.
* **Runny nose:** Both components can help reduce nasal discharge.
* **Itchy, watery eyes:** Levocetirizine helps alleviate these allergic symptoms.
* **Itching:** Both components contribute to reducing itching.
* **Headache, body aches, and fever:** Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the primary component for reducing these symptoms.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Common:** Drowsiness, headache, dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, fatigue.
* **Less Common:**  Constipation, stomach upset, vomiting.
* **Rare but Serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), liver damage (with high doses of paracetamol).  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**

**How it Works:**

* **Levocetirizine:** This is an antihistamine.  Antihistamines work by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  By blocking histamine, levocetirizine reduces symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain and fever.
