# Losartan

**Generic Name:** Losartan Potassium

**Usage:**

Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).  It's primarily used to treat:

* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  Losartan helps lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney disease.
* **Type 2 diabetes with nephropathy (kidney disease):** It slows the progression of kidney damage in patients with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.
* **Heart failure:**  Losartan can improve symptoms and survival in patients with heart failure.


**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, losartan can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects include:

* **Dizziness or lightheadedness:** This is often more pronounced at the start of treatment.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Upper respiratory infection:**  Cold or flu-like symptoms.
* **Diarrhea or constipation:** Changes in bowel habits.
* **Muscle cramps:** Pain or spasms in muscles.


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **High potassium levels (hyperkalemia):** Especially in patients with kidney problems.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** Can lead to fainting or dizziness.
* **Kidney problems:** Worsening of pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat):** A serious allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Liver problems:**  Changes in liver function tests.


**How it Works:**

Losartan works by blocking the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, losartan helps relax and widen blood vessels, reducing blood pressure.  This also reduces the workload on the heart and improves blood flow to the kidneys.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking losartan?**  A:  While not strictly prohibited, combining alcohol with losartan can increase the risk of low blood pressure and dizziness.  Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.

* **Q: Can I take losartan with other medications?** A:  Losartan can interact with other medications, including some diuretics (water pills), potassium supplements, and NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen).  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications you are taking.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: When should I contact my doctor?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects, such as swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat; difficulty breathing; chest pain; or persistent dizziness or lightheadedness.

* **Q: Can I stop taking losartan suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping losartan abruptly can cause a sudden increase in blood pressure.  Always follow your doctor's instructions when stopping this medication.
