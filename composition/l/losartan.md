# Losartan
### Generic Name
Losartan

### Usage
Losartan is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by relaxing blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure and reduces the workload on the heart.  This helps prevent serious complications of hypertension such as stroke, heart attack, and kidney disease.

Losartan also has a secondary, important use in treating diabetic nephropathy (kidney damage caused by diabetes) in patients with type 2 diabetes who also have high blood pressure and elevated levels of protein in their urine.  It helps to slow the progression of kidney damage in these individuals.  While not officially FDA-approved for these uses, Losartan is sometimes used off-label in the treatment of heart failure, post-transplant erythrocytosis (in kidney transplant recipients), and Marfan syndrome with aortic aneurysm.  These off-label uses require careful monitoring and are typically only considered under specific circumstances by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Hypertension:**  The starting dose is usually 50 mg once daily. This may be adjusted to 25-100 mg once or twice daily, depending on individual response.  Patients already taking diuretics or those with low blood volume may start with a lower dose (25 mg).

* **Hypertension with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy:** The starting dose is 50 mg once daily, with a maximum dose of 100 mg once daily.

* **Diabetic Nephropathy:** The usual starting dose is 50 mg once daily, with a maximum dose of 100 mg once daily.

* **Off-label uses (Heart failure, Post-transplant erythrocytosis, Marfan syndrome):** Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific condition and the patient's response; therefore, precise dosage information is best obtained directly from a healthcare professional.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

Losartan's use in children is generally limited to specific conditions and requires careful monitoring by a physician. Dosages are typically calculated based on the child's weight and the specific condition being treated. It's crucial to follow a doctor's precise instructions for pediatric use.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** In patients with mild to moderate liver problems, the starting dose should be reduced.  Severe liver impairment may necessitate further dose reduction or alternative treatment.

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment isn't usually required for patients with kidney problems, however, it's generally not recommended for children with severely reduced kidney function.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Upper respiratory infections
* Back pain
* Muscle aches

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) – This is a serious, potentially life-threatening side effect requiring immediate medical attention.
* Hypotension (low blood pressure) – Can cause dizziness or fainting.
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) – Can be dangerous for heart health.
* Renal impairment (worsening kidney function)

If any side effects occur, consult your healthcare provider for advice.

### How it Works

Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Angiotensin II is a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict (narrow), raising blood pressure. Losartan works by blocking the action of angiotensin II, preventing it from binding to its receptors. This leads to relaxation of blood vessels and a consequent decrease in blood pressure.  In diabetic nephropathy, it also helps to protect the kidneys from further damage.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Losartan is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it can cause harm to a developing fetus.  It should be stopped immediately if pregnancy occurs.
* **Breastfeeding:** It's unknown whether Losartan passes into breast milk.  The decision to continue breastfeeding while taking Losartan should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional.
* **Renal Impairment:** Patients with significant kidney problems may require dosage adjustments or alternative therapies.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Patients with liver problems may require dosage adjustments.
* **Drug Interactions:** Losartan can interact with other medications, particularly other blood pressure medications, diuretics, NSAIDs, and potassium supplements. Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Severe allergic reactions, including angioedema, are possible. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
* **Aliskiren:** Losartan should not be used in combination with aliskiren in patients with diabetes and moderate to severe kidney impairment.
