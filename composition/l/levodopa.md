# Levodopa
### Generic Name
Levodopa

### Usage
Levodopa is primarily used to treat Parkinson's disease.  It's a crucial component in managing the motor symptoms associated with this neurodegenerative disorder.  Specifically, it's used as an add-on therapy to carbidopa/levodopa combination medication to manage "off episodes."  These off episodes are periods where Parkinson's symptoms return despite regular medication, causing a temporary worsening of motor function.  Levodopa doesn't cure Parkinson's disease but helps alleviate its symptoms, improving mobility, coordination, and overall quality of life for affected individuals.


### Dosage
Levodopa dosage is highly individualized and depends on factors like the patient's response to treatment, the severity of their Parkinson's disease, and their overall health.  It's crucial to follow the physician's prescribed dosage meticulously.  The information below is for general understanding and should not substitute a doctor's guidance.

**For Adults (as an adjunct to carbidopa/levodopa):** The usual starting dose is 84mg (two 42mg capsules), inhaled up to five times daily as needed, when symptoms of an off-period return.  However, the maximum single dose should not exceed 84mg, and the maximum daily dose should not exceed 420mg.

**For Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Levodopa in children have not been established.  It is not typically prescribed for pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. A physician's guidance is crucial when dealing with such conditions.


### Side Effects
Levodopa, like many medications, can cause various side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  The frequency and severity vary from person to person.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Cough
* Nausea and Vomiting
* Headache
* Insomnia
* Falling
* Dyskinesia (involuntary movements)
* Limb pain

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hallucinations
* Chest discomfort
* Decreased blood pressure (hypotension)
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)
* Abnormal behavior
* Abnormalities in thinking
* Drowsiness
* Sudden onset of sleep
* Increased serum bilirubin levels
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP)
* Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells)

If you experience any side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, it's crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine, a neurotransmitter vital for motor control. In Parkinson's disease, dopamine-producing neurons in the brain degenerate, leading to the characteristic motor symptoms. Levodopa can cross the blood-brain barrier, where it's converted into dopamine. This replenishment of dopamine levels helps alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, restoring better motor function.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Levodopa is contraindicated with non-selective MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) within 14 days of use.  This combination can cause dangerously high blood pressure.
* **Drug Interactions:** Levodopa can interact with numerous medications, including antipsychotics, some antidepressants, and certain blood pressure medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.
* **Warnings:** Levodopa can increase the risk of falls, hallucinations, psychosis, and other behavioral changes.  Patients with glaucoma, psychotic disorders, asthma, COPD, or other lung diseases should exercise extra caution.  Sudden discontinuation of Levodopa can lead to withdrawal symptoms resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of Levodopa during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  Consult your physician before using Levodopa if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
