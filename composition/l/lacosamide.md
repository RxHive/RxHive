# Lacosamide

**Generic Name:** Lacosamide

**Usage:** Lacosamide is an anticonvulsant medication used to treat:

* **Partial-onset seizures** in adults and children aged 4 years and older.  This includes seizures with or without secondary generalization.
* **Lennox-Gastaut syndrome** in adults and children aged 2 years and older.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, lacosamide can cause side effects.  The most common include:

* **Dizziness:** This is often reported and can be significant enough to affect daily activities.
* **Headache:**  A frequent side effect, sometimes severe.
* **Nausea:** Can range from mild discomfort to vomiting.
* **Diplopia (double vision):** Blurred or double vision.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Ataxia (loss of coordination):** Difficulty with balance and coordination.
* **Somnolence (sleepiness):** Excessive sleepiness or drowsiness.

* **Heart problems:**  Changes in heart rate or rhythm.
* **Liver problems:**  Monitor liver function tests if prescribed.
* **Stevens-Johnson syndrome:** A rare but serious skin reaction.


**How it Works:** Lacosamide's exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work by:

* **Modulating the release of neurotransmitters:** Specifically, it interacts with voltage-gated sodium channels in neurons, affecting the way nerve impulses are transmitted. This helps to stabilize the abnormal electrical activity in the brain that causes seizures.
* **Increasing the release of GABA:** Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, and increasing its action helps to reduce neuronal excitability.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take lacosamide with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking, as interactions are possible.  Certain medications may increase the risk of side effects.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Can I stop taking lacosamide suddenly?** A: No, you should never stop taking lacosamide abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can lead to an increased risk of seizures.  Your doctor will gradually reduce your dose over time.
* **Q:  Is lacosamide addictive?** A:  Lacosamide is not considered an addictive substance in the same way as opioids or other substances, however, stopping it abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms, making it crucial to follow your doctor's instructions.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, particularly those listed as serious side effects above.
