# Lacosamide
### Generic Name
Lacosamide

### Usage
Lacosamide is an anticonvulsant medication primarily used to treat partial-onset seizures in adults and children aged 4 years and older.  It can be used as monotherapy (the sole medication) or as adjunctive therapy (in addition to other anti-seizure medications).  While not its primary indication, Lacosamide has also been used off-label in the treatment of status epilepticus (a prolonged seizure).

### Dosage

**Adults (17 years and older):**

* **Partial-onset seizures (Monotherapy):**  The initial oral or intravenous (IV) dose is typically 100 mg twice daily (BID). This can be increased by 50 mg BID weekly, based on individual response and tolerance. Alternatively, a 200 mg loading dose can be given initially, followed by 100 mg BID twelve hours later. The maintenance dose usually ranges from 150-200 mg BID (300-400 mg/day).  Loading doses should be administered under medical supervision due to a higher risk of central nervous system (CNS) side effects.
* **Partial-onset seizures (Adjunctive Therapy):** The initial oral or IV dose is typically 50 mg BID.  The dose can be titrated upwards by 50 mg BID weekly, as needed.  Again, a 200 mg loading dose, followed by 100 mg BID twelve hours later, is an alternative. The maintenance dose is generally 100-200 mg BID (200-400 mg/day).  Doses up to 600 mg/day may be used, but this increases the risk of side effects. Loading doses should be administered under medical supervision.
* **Status Epilepticus (Off-label):** IV administration is typically initiated with a single dose of 200-400 mg, followed by a daily maintenance dose of 200-400 mg/day divided into two doses.  Some patients may require up to 600 mg/day.

**Children and Adolescents (4-17 years):**

Dosage is weight-based and administered orally.  Precise dosing guidelines vary considerably based on weight; therefore, a physician should always determine the appropriate dose.  The medication should be titrated slowly, monitoring for both efficacy and side effects. IV use is not established in pediatric patients.  For severe, refractory seizures in this age group, the starting dose is usually 1-2 mg/kg/day divided into two doses.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  These adjustments are complex and depend on the severity of impairment; therefore a physician should guide dose selection.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Ataxia (loss of coordination)
* Vertigo
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Pruritus (itching)
* Bruising

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Cerebellar syndrome
* Suicidal ideation and behavior
* Serious cardiac arrhythmias (including AV block)
* Multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions (DRESS syndrome)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis
* Agranulocytosis (severe drop in white blood cells)

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Lacosamide works by affecting the sodium channels in nerve cells. It enhances the slow inactivation of these channels, which helps stabilize the electrical activity of the neurons and reduces the excessive firing that can cause seizures.  It doesn't affect the fast inactivation of sodium channels.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Lacosamide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or its components, and in those with a history of second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.
* **Cardiac Effects:** Lacosamide can prolong the PR interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) and may cause various cardiac arrhythmias.  Careful monitoring is needed, especially in patients with pre-existing heart conditions or those taking other medications that affect the heart.  ECG monitoring before starting treatment and at steady state is recommended for at-risk patients.
* **CNS Effects:** Dizziness and ataxia are common side effects. Caution is advised when operating machinery or driving.
* **Suicidal Ideation:**  Suicidal thoughts and behavior have been reported.  Close monitoring for suicidal ideation is essential, especially in patients with a history of depression or suicidal tendencies.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are required for individuals with liver or kidney problems.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Lacosamide is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning the risk to the fetus is not fully understood.  The decision to breastfeed while taking Lacosamide should be made in consultation with a physician.
* **Drug Interactions:** Lacosamide may interact with other medications, particularly those that affect the heart, liver, or kidneys.  Inform your physician about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies being taken.

### FAQs

* **Can I take Lacosamide with other medications?**  Always inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.  Some medications may interact with Lacosamide.
* **How should I store Lacosamide?** Store Lacosamide as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and light.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Can I stop taking Lacosamide suddenly?** No, you should not stop taking Lacosamide suddenly.  Stopping abruptly can increase the frequency of seizures.  Your doctor will provide guidance on gradually tapering off the medication.
* **Is Lacosamide addictive?** Lacosamide is not considered an addictive medication.
