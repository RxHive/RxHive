# Levosulpiride + Ilaprazole

There is no such combination drug as Levosulpiride + Ilaprazole currently marketed or approved by any major regulatory body.  Levosulpiride is an antipsychotic and prokinetic agent, while Ilaprazole is a proton pump inhibitor.  While these drugs are sometimes used to treat separate conditions that might co-occur (e.g., gastrointestinal issues and psychotic symptoms), they are not combined in a single pharmaceutical product. Prescribing them together would require separate prescriptions and administration.


Therefore, providing details in the requested format for a non-existent combination drug is impossible.  If you're interested in information about Levosulpiride and Ilaprazole *separately*, please provide separate requests for each drug.
