# Levocetirizine + Ambroxol

**Generic Name:** Levocetirizine + Ambroxol

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  Levocetirizine, an antihistamine, helps relieve runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes. Ambroxol, an expectorant, helps thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.  It's often used to treat symptoms like a cough with phlegm.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Levocetirizine + Ambroxol can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **From Levocetirizine:** Drowsiness, headache, dry mouth, fatigue, nausea.  Less common but more serious side effects can include dizziness, palpitations, and allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).
* **From Ambroxol:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset.  Rarely, more serious side effects may occur.

**It's crucial to note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and consult a doctor or pharmacist immediately.


**How it Works:**

* **Levocetirizine:** This is a selective antagonist of peripheral H1-receptors.  Simply put, it blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, thus reducing allergic symptoms like runny nose and sneezing.
* **Ambroxol:** This is an expectorant that increases the production of surfactant in the lungs. Surfactant helps to thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up and clear from the airways.  It also has a mild mucolytic effect, helping break down mucus.
