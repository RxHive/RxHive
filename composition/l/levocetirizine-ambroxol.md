# Levocetirizine + Ambroxol
### Generic Name
Levocetirizine + Ambroxol


### Usage

Levocetirizine + Ambroxol is a combination medication used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections.  It combines the effects of two active ingredients:

* **Levocetirizine:** This is a second-generation antihistamine.  It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body in response to allergens.  Histamine is responsible for many allergy symptoms, including sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and hives. In this combination, levocetirizine primarily addresses the allergic component often accompanying upper respiratory infections.

* **Ambroxol:** This is a mucolytic agent.  It helps to thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up and clear congestion. This action directly addresses the symptoms of a cough and helps alleviate the feeling of chest tightness associated with respiratory illnesses.

Therefore, this combination medication targets both the allergic and the congestion-related symptoms common in conditions like the common cold, bronchitis, and other upper respiratory infections.  It's important to remember that this medication treats *symptoms* and doesn't cure the underlying infection.


### Dosage

Dosage will vary depending on the specific formulation (tablet, syrup, etc.) and the manufacturer.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist and carefully read the patient information leaflet included with your medication.  **Never exceed the recommended dose.**

* **Adults:**  Typical dosages range from one tablet or spoonful of syrup once or twice daily, depending on the formulation and the severity of symptoms.

* **Children:**  Dosage for children varies significantly with age and weight.  There are often different formulations specifically for children, with lower dosages.  **It is crucial to consult a pediatrician or pharmacist before administering this medication to children.** They will determine the appropriate dose based on your child's age and weight.

* **Oral Administration:** Tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Syrups should be measured using the provided measuring device and taken as directed.

* **IV Administration:** This combination is not typically administered intravenously.  Ambroxol and levocetirizine are generally administered orally.


### Side Effects

Common side effects, which usually are mild and temporary, may include:

* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Stomach upset

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Fast heartbeat
* Seizures (rare)

If you experience any serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.  Even if side effects are mild, it's important to consult your doctor or pharmacist if they are bothersome or persistent.


### How it Works

As described earlier, this combination drug works through two separate mechanisms:

* **Levocetirizine** blocks histamine receptors, preventing histamine from causing allergic symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itching.

* **Ambroxol** increases the secretion of fluid into the airways, reducing the viscosity (thickness) of mucus.  This makes it easier to cough up phlegm and clear congested airways.  Ambroxol also stimulates the movement of cilia (tiny hair-like structures in the airways) aiding in mucus clearance.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before taking this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Kidney Disease:**  Individuals with kidney problems may require dose adjustments.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose.

* **Liver Disease:**  Similar to kidney disease, dose adjustments may be necessary for those with liver problems.  Consult your doctor.

* **Interactions with other drugs:** This medication may interact with other medications, including sedatives, alcohol, and some other antihistamines.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are currently taking.

* **Driving and operating machinery:** Levocetirizine may cause drowsiness.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if you feel drowsy.

* **Alcohol:** Avoid consuming alcohol while taking this medication, as it may increase the risk of drowsiness.


### FAQs
