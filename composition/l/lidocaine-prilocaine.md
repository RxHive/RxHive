# Lidocaine + Prilocaine

**Generic Name:** Lidocaine + Prilocaine (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics, EMLA)

**Usage:**  EMLA cream is a topical anesthetic used to numb the skin before minor medical procedures.  This includes:

* **Needle insertion:** Blood draws, injections, intravenous (IV) line placement.
* **Minor surgical procedures:**  Skin biopsies, wound care, superficial dermatological procedures.
* **Pain relief:**  For painful conditions like superficial burns, minor abrasions, or lacerations.
* **Catheterization:**  To reduce discomfort associated with catheter insertion.

**Important Note:**  EMLA is not suitable for all procedures or all patients.  A doctor should determine its appropriateness for each individual case.  It is not a substitute for proper pain management techniques during major procedures or for deep anesthesia.


**Side Effects:** While generally well-tolerated, side effects can occur and may include:

* **Local skin reactions:**  Burning, stinging, itching, redness, swelling, rash at the application site. These are usually mild and temporary.
* **Systemic reactions (rare):**  These are more likely with larger application areas or impaired skin barrier function (e.g., broken skin).  Symptoms can include drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, muscle twitching, seizures, cardiovascular problems (low blood pressure, slow heart rate).  These require immediate medical attention.
* **Methemoglobinemia (rare but serious):**  A condition where the blood's ability to carry oxygen is reduced.  This is more likely in individuals with certain genetic predispositions or those applying large amounts of cream. Symptoms include bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes, shortness of breath, and fatigue.

**How it Works:** Lidocaine and prilocaine are local anesthetics.  When applied topically, they block the nerve signals that transmit pain sensations from the treated area to the brain.  The eutectic mixture (EMLA) allows for better penetration and effectiveness compared to using either anesthetic alone. The cream needs sufficient time (usually 30-60 minutes, depending on the area and thickness of the skin) to take full effect.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does it last?** The duration of numbness depends on the amount applied, the area treated, and the individual's sensitivity.  Generally, numbness lasts for 1-2 hours.
* **Can I use it on open wounds?**  Generally, no.  Use should be avoided on broken or severely damaged skin.  Consult a healthcare professional.
* **Can I use it on children?** It can be used in children, but under strict medical supervision due to the potential for systemic side effects.
* **Can I use it on mucous membranes?** No, it is not intended for use on mucous membranes.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  For mild side effects, remove the cream and wash the area with water. For more severe symptoms, such as dizziness or bluish discoloration, seek immediate medical attention.
* **Is it safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a healthcare professional as the benefits need to be weighed against potential risks.
