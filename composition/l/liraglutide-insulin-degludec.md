# Liraglutide + Insulin Degludec

It's important to note that there is **no currently approved generic version of the combination product liraglutide + insulin degludec**.  Liraglutide (Victoza) and insulin degludec (Tresiba) are available as separate medications and are sometimes prescribed together by a physician.  The following information reflects the individual components and potential combined effects, not a combined generic product.


**Generic Name:**

* **Liraglutide:**  Liraglutide (The brand name Victoza is commonly used)
* **Insulin Degludec:** Insulin degludec (The brand name Tresiba is commonly used)


**Usage:**

* **Liraglutide:**  Used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It may be used alone or with other diabetes medications.  It can also be used to reduce cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.
* **Insulin Degludec:**  Used to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It's a long-acting insulin, providing a relatively consistent level of insulin in the body over an extended period. It may be used alone or in combination with other insulins or diabetes medications.

**Combined Usage:** Liraglutide and insulin degludec are often used together when blood sugar control isn't adequate with liraglutide alone.  The combination aims to improve glycemic control by supplementing the incretin effect of liraglutide with the basal insulin provided by insulin degludec.  This is a physician-directed decision based on individual patient needs.


**Side Effects:**

* **Liraglutide:**  Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain.  Less common but more serious side effects can include pancreatitis, gallbladder problems, and kidney problems.  There is also a potential for increased risk of thyroid tumors (though rare).
* **Insulin Degludec:**  Common side effects include hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), weight gain, injection site reactions, and edema (swelling).  Less common but more serious side effects can include severe hypoglycemia, lipohypertrophy (thickening of fat tissue at the injection site), and allergic reactions.

**Combined Side Effects:**  When used together, the side effects of both medications can occur.  The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when combining liraglutide and insulin degludec because both can lower blood glucose levels.


**How it Works:**

* **Liraglutide:**  It's a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.  This means it mimics the effects of GLP-1, a natural hormone that helps regulate blood sugar.  It works by increasing insulin release when blood sugar is high, decreasing glucagon secretion (a hormone that raises blood sugar), slowing gastric emptying, and potentially reducing appetite.
* **Insulin Degludec:**  It's a long-acting insulin analog that provides a constant level of insulin in the body to help regulate blood sugar.  It works by binding to insulin receptors on cells, allowing glucose to enter cells and be used for energy.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is this combination safe?** A: When used under the supervision of a healthcare professional and with careful monitoring of blood sugar levels, this combination can be safe and effective for many individuals. However, individual risk factors must be considered.
* **Q: How is the dosage determined?** A: Dosage of both liraglutide and insulin degludec are determined by the physician based on individual factors such as blood glucose levels, other medications, and overall health.
* **Q: What are the signs of hypoglycemia?** A:  Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include sweating, shakiness, confusion, dizziness, weakness, headache, and rapid heartbeat.  Severe hypoglycemia can lead to loss of consciousness.
* **Q: Can I take this combination without a doctor's prescription?** A: No, both liraglutide and insulin degludec are prescription medications and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
