# Lisdexamfetamine
### Generic Name
Lisdexamfetamine

### Usage
Lisdexamfetamine is primarily used to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults and children aged 6 years and older, and moderate-to-severe Binge Eating Disorder (BED) in adults and adolescents aged 18 years and older.  It's crucial to understand that lisdexamfetamine is **not** indicated for weight loss.  Its effectiveness in ADHD stems from its ability to improve focus, attention, and reduce hyperactivity. In BED, it helps to curb excessive eating episodes.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Before starting treatment, a healthcare professional should assess for the presence of cardiac disease and the risk of substance abuse.

**Adults (ADHD and BED):**

*   Lisdexamfetamine is administered orally, either as capsules or chewable tablets.
*   The typical starting dose for both ADHD and BED is 30 mg once daily (OD) in the morning.
*   Dosage adjustments are made in increments of 10-20 mg at weekly intervals, as needed, to achieve the optimal response.  
*   The maximum daily dose is 70 mg.
*   The dose should be individualized based on the patient's response and needs, always starting with the lowest effective dose.
*   The first dose should be taken as soon as the patient wakes up; late evening doses should be avoided.

**Children (ADHD):**

*   For children aged 6 years and older with ADHD, the dosage is the same as for adults, using appropriate capsule or chewable tablet formulations.

**Dosage Adjustments Based on Renal Function:**

*   For adults and adolescents with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m², no dosage adjustment is typically needed.
*   For a GFR of 15 to <30 mL/min/1.73 m², the maximum daily dose should be 50 mg.
*   For a GFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m², the maximum daily dose should be 30 mg.
*   For patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, the maximum dose is 30 mg/day.  Lisdexamfetamine and its active metabolite, dextroamphetamine, are not dialyzable.

**Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are typically recommended for patients with hepatic impairment.

*   Vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, anorexia, gastroenteritis
*   Tremor
*   Erectile dysfunction, urinary tract infection

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

*   Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, urticaria)
*   Serious cardiovascular events (sudden death, stroke, myocardial infarction)
*   Seizures
*   Psychotic or manic symptoms
*   Suppression of linear growth in children

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug, meaning it's converted in the body into its active form, dextroamphetamine. Dextroamphetamine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that primarily affects the brain's neurotransmitter systems.  It increases the release of dopamine and norepinephrine, neurochemicals involved in focus, attention, mood, and energy levels. By increasing these neurotransmitters, lisdexamfetamine helps to alleviate symptoms of ADHD and BED.  The exact mechanism of action in these conditions isn't fully understood, but the modulation of dopamine and norepinephrine is believed to play a significant role.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

*   Allergy to lisdexamfetamine or any component of the formulation.
*   Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or within 14 days of stopping MAOI treatment.
*   Known hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to sympathomimetic amines.
*   Advanced arteriosclerosis.
*   Symptomatic cardiovascular disease.
*   Moderate-to-severe hypertension.
*   Hyperthyroidism.
*   Glaucoma.
*   Agitated states.
*   History of drug abuse.


**Warnings and Precautions:**

*   Lisdexamfetamine has a high potential for abuse and dependence. Careful monitoring is necessary.
*   Use with caution in patients with hypertension, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, or a history of psychosis or drug abuse.
*   Monitor children for growth suppression.
*   Avoid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
*   May impair the ability to operate machinery or drive.
*   Concurrent use with certain medications, including MAOIs and other CNS stimulants, should be avoided or carefully managed.
*   Sudden discontinuation after prolonged use may cause withdrawal symptoms.

### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take lisdexamfetamine with other medications?**  A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting lisdexamfetamine.  Interactions with certain drugs are possible.
