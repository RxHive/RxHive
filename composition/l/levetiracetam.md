# Levetiracetam

**Generic Name:** Levetiracetam

**Usage:**

Levetiracetam is an anticonvulsant medication used to treat seizures in people with epilepsy.  Specifically, it's used for:

* **Adjunctive therapy:**  This means it's used *in addition* to other anti-seizure medications to help control seizures that aren't adequately controlled by a single drug.
* **Monotherapy:** In some cases, levetiracetam can be used as the sole medication to treat certain types of seizures.  This is often determined for newly diagnosed epilepsy patients.
* **Myoclonic seizures:**  Levetiracetam is particularly effective in treating myoclonic seizures (brief, involuntary muscle jerks).
* **Tonic-clonic seizures:** It's also used to treat generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures).
* **Partial-onset seizures:** It's effective in treating partial-onset seizures (seizures originating in one part of the brain).
* **Lennox-Gastaut syndrome:**  Levetiracetam may be part of a treatment regimen for this severe childhood epilepsy syndrome.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of users) may include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very frequent side effect, often decreasing over time.
* **Dizziness:**  Can lead to falls, especially in elderly individuals.
* **Weakness/fatigue:**  Feeling tired and lacking energy.
* **Headache:**  Can range from mild to moderate intensity.
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Weight gain:**  Increased appetite and weight may occur.
* **Ataxia (loss of coordination):**  Difficulty with balance and coordination.
* **Somnolence (excessive sleepiness):** More severe than just drowsiness.


Less common but serious side effects can include:

* **Suicidal thoughts or behavior:**  Immediate medical attention is necessary if these occur.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Symptoms include rash, swelling, difficulty breathing.
* **Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas):**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe abdominal pain.
* **Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):**  Liver function tests should be monitored.
* **Stevens-Johnson syndrome:**  A rare but serious skin reaction.
* **Neuropsychiatric events:**  Changes in behavior, mood, or thinking.


**How it Works:**

The exact mechanism of action of levetiracetam isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to work by interacting with synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), a protein found in nerve cells that plays a role in neurotransmitter release. By modulating the activity of SV2A, levetiracetam is thought to reduce the excessive neuronal activity that causes seizures.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I stop taking levetiracetam suddenly?** No, you should never stop taking levetiracetam abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to increased seizure frequency and severity.  The dosage should be gradually reduced under medical supervision.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking levetiracetam?**  Alcohol can increase the drowsiness and dizziness associated with levetiracetam. It's best to avoid alcohol or limit consumption significantly while on this medication.  Consult your doctor for guidance.

* **Can levetiracetam cause depression or anxiety?**  While not a common side effect, some individuals may experience changes in mood, including depression or anxiety.  It's crucial to report any mental health changes to your doctor.

* **Is levetiracetam safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** The risks and benefits should be carefully considered.  Consult your doctor about the safest course of action, as levetiracetam can cross the placenta and be present in breast milk.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.

* **How long does it take for levetiracetam to work?** The effect may vary depending on the individual.  It might take several weeks to achieve optimal seizure control.
