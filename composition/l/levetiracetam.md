# Levetiracetam
### Generic Name
Levetiracetam

### Usage

Levetiracetam is an anticonvulsant primarily used to treat partial-onset seizures.  This means it's effective against seizures that begin in a specific area of the brain and may or may not spread to other areas.  It's often used as an add-on medication (adjunctive therapy) to other anti-seizure drugs, meaning it's taken alongside another medication to better control seizures.

Importantly, Levetiracetam also has FDA-approved uses for:

* **Myoclonic seizures:**  These are brief, shock-like jerks or spasms of the muscles.  In patients 12 years and older with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, Levetiracetam can help manage these seizures.
* **Primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures:** These are severe seizures involving the entire brain, causing loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions.  Levetiracetam is approved for patients 6 years and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (a type of epilepsy with a genetic basis).


While not explicitly approved by the FDA for all seizure types, Levetiracetam is sometimes used off-label for other seizure disorders,  including status epilepticus (a prolonged seizure) and as seizure prophylaxis (prevention) in specific situations such as after brain surgery or head trauma.  Use in such cases should always be under the strict guidance of a neurologist.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the patient's age, weight, condition, and the specific formulation of Levetiracetam (immediate-release tablets, oral solution, extended-release tablets, intravenous injection).  It's crucial to follow a doctor's precise instructions. The information below is for general understanding and should not replace professional medical advice.


**Adults:**

* **Focal-onset seizures and generalized-onset seizures (FDA-approved):**  Typically starts at 500mg twice daily (BID) and is gradually increased in increments of 500mg every two weeks up to a maximum of 1500mg BID, based on individual response and tolerability.  Extended-release formulations have different starting doses and titration schedules. IV administration follows a similar titration scheme.
* **Off-label uses (Status epilepticus, seizure prophylaxis):** Doses vary greatly depending on the specific situation and often involve higher initial doses followed by maintenance doses.  Always follow physician instructions.


**Children:**

Pediatric dosing is weight-based and varies considerably depending on age and the specific seizure type.  For example, infants, children, and adolescents with myoclonic seizures or generalized tonic-clonic seizures may receive different initial and maximum doses than those with partial-onset seizures.   The physician will determine the appropriate dosage based on individual needs and will adjust the dosage based on the child's response and any side effects. Always consult with a pediatrician or child neurologist for appropriate pediatric dosages.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting >10% of patients):**

* Nervous system: Drowsiness, headache, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, behavioral changes (aggression, anxiety, depression)
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting
* Respiratory: Upper respiratory infections (common cold symptoms)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (affecting <10% of patients, but require immediate medical attention):**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema)
* Skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Blood disorders (low white blood cell count, low platelet count)
* Liver problems
* Kidney problems
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior
* Pancreatitis

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

The exact mechanism of Levetiracetam's action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to involve several factors affecting nerve cell communication in the brain. It may alter the release of neurotransmitters, influencing the electrical activity in the brain and thereby reducing the likelihood of seizures.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Do not take Levetiracetam if you're allergic to it or any of its ingredients.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with kidney problems.  This is because Levetiracetam is primarily eliminated through the kidneys.
* **Liver Disease:** While dosage adjustments aren't typically needed for liver disease, monitoring may be necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Levetiracetam is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus haven't been fully determined.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor. It's also excreted in breast milk, so the decision to breastfeed should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.
* **Drug Interactions:** Levetiracetam can interact with other medications, potentially increasing or decreasing their effects. Inform your doctor about all medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Drowsiness is a common side effect; avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.


### FAQs

* **Can I stop taking Levetiracetam suddenly?** No, never stop taking Levetiracetam abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can increase seizure frequency.
* **How should I store Levetiracetam?** Store it as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **What if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double the dose.
* **Is Levetiracetam habit-forming?**  Levetiracetam is not considered a habit-forming drug in the same way as opioids or other controlled substances. However, it's crucial to adhere to your prescribed dosage and not increase or discontinue the medication without medical advice.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Levetiracetam?**  Alcohol can exacerbate the drowsiness caused by Levetiracetam and is generally best avoided.  Discuss this with your doctor.
