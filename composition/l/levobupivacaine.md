# Levobupivacaine
### Generic Name
Levobupivacaine

### Usage

Levobupivacaine is a local anesthetic primarily used for pain management and surgical anesthesia.  Its main applications include:

* **Pain Management in Adults:**  This includes epidural analgesia for chronic pain, post-operative pain, and labor pain.  The medication can be administered as a bolus injection or continuous infusion.

* **Surgical Anesthesia in Adults:** Levobupivacaine is employed for various surgical procedures, ranging from major surgeries requiring epidural, intrathecal, or peripheral nerve blocks to minor procedures using local infiltration or peribulbar blocks (around the eye).

* **Infiltration Analgesia in Children (over 6 months and under 12 years):**  Specifically, it's used for ilioinguinal or iliohypogastric nerve blocks to manage pain in this age group.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the type of procedure, the patient's age and weight, and the specific administration route.  Always follow the prescribing physician's instructions carefully.  The information below is for general understanding and should *not* be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Adults:** Dosages are typically expressed as milliliters (mL) of a solution with a specific concentration (e.g., 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75%).  Maximum single and cumulative doses exist, and exceeding these can lead to serious adverse effects.  The specific dosage for surgical anesthesia and pain management varies widely depending on the location and type of procedure, and should be determined by a medical professional. The drug is typically administered in increments or fractions of the total dose to monitor for potential toxic reactions.

* **Surgical Anesthesia (Examples):**  Dental procedures might use 5-10 mL of a 0.5%-0.75% solution. Epidural anesthesia for Cesarean sections might use 15-30 mL of 0.5% solution (with a maximum single dose of 150 mg).  Other surgical procedures might use 10-20 mL of a 0.5%-0.75% solution, but the maximum single dose of 150mg should not be exceeded.  Prolonged surgeries might require a cumulative dose up to 400 mg in 24 hours.  Intrathecal administration might involve 3 mL of a 0.5% solution.


* **Pain Management (Examples):**  For labor pain, epidural bolus injections of 6-20 mL of 0.25% solution might be used with a waiting period of at least 15 minutes between injections.  Epidural infusions typically range from 4-15 mL/hour of a lower concentration solution (e.g., 0.0625% to 0.25%), with maximum rates and cumulative daily doses specified to avoid toxicity.  Postoperative pain management also uses epidural infusions.

**Children (over 6 months and under 12 years):** For ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric blocks, dosages are calculated based on weight, typically using 0.5 mL/kg/side of a 0.25% solution or 0.25 mL/kg/side of a 0.5% solution. A maximum dose of 1.25 mg/kg/side should not be exceeded.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  While specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment aren't explicitly stated in the provided information, caution is advised in patients with severe hepatic disease (due to hepatic metabolism) and renal impairment (due to renal excretion of metabolites). Repeated doses may need to be reduced in patients with liver problems due to slower elimination of the drug.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Anemia
* Postoperative pain and fever


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Nervous system effects: Headache, dizziness, pain, paresthesia (numbness or tingling), hypoesthesia (decreased sensation), rigors (shivering), hypothermia, anxiety, drowsiness
* Cardiovascular effects: ECG abnormalities, bradycardia (slow heart rate), tachycardia (fast heart rate), hypertension
* Gastrointestinal effects: Constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence
* Dermatologic effects: Pruritus (itching), increased wound secretion
* Genitourinary effects: Urinary tract infection, prolonged labor (in obstetric use)
* Hematologic effects: Leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count)
* Respiratory effects: Cough
* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild to severe, including anaphylaxis)


**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  Many other, less frequent, side effects are possible, including serious cardiovascular and neurological complications. If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Levobupivacaine is a local anesthetic that works by blocking nerve impulses. It does this by binding to sodium channels in the nerve cell membranes, reducing the permeability of the membrane to sodium ions. This prevents the nerve cells from depolarizing and transmitting pain signals to the brain.  Essentially, it numbs the affected area by interrupting the transmission of nerve signals responsible for pain and sensation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Levobupivacaine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or other amide-type local anesthetics; in patients with severe hypotension (shock); for intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier block); for obstetric use with paracervical block; and for obstetric use with the 0.75% solution (increased risk of cardiotoxic effects).

* **Drug Interactions:** Use with caution in patients receiving other drugs with local anesthetic activity or class III antiarrhythmic agents, as their effects may be additive and increase the risk of toxicity.

* **Warnings:** Increased risks exist for allergic reactions, cardiovascular events, CNS toxicity, intra-articular infusion-related chondrolysis, and respiratory arrest.  Use with caution in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, hepatic or renal impairment, neurological disorders, or who are acutely ill, debilitated, or elderly. Extra caution is warranted when using higher concentrations, injecting into the head and neck area, or administering for more than 24 hours (increased neurotoxicity risk).

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Levobupivacaine is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning animal studies have shown no risk, but human studies are lacking.  The 0.75% solution is contraindicated for obstetric use. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; thus, use with caution during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does Levobupivacaine last?** A: The duration of action depends on the dose, concentration, and administration route. It can range from hours to days, depending on the specific application.

* **Q: How should Levobupivacaine be stored?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature and away from direct light and heat.

* **Q: Can I take other medications while using Levobupivacaine?** A:  Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  Interactions are possible.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: This medication is typically administered by a healthcare professional, so a "missed dose" isn't applicable in the same way as oral medications. Contact your doctor if you have any questions or concerns regarding your treatment.

* **Q: Is Levobupivacaine addictive?** A:  Levobupivacaine is not considered an addictive substance.
