# Liquorice
### Generic Name
Liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)

### Usage
Liquorice root extract has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent.  Its primary uses are related to its demulcent and expectorant properties, making it a traditional remedy for coughs and sore throats.  It's believed to soothe irritated mucous membranes and help loosen phlegm.  Liquorice also exhibits ulcer-healing properties, potentially due to its ability to stimulate mucus production.  Some studies suggest additional properties, such as antispasmodic and laxative effects, though further research is needed to confirm these conclusively.  It's crucial to note that while licorice has been used traditionally for various ailments, scientific evidence supporting many of these uses is limited.


### Dosage
The appropriate dosage of licorice is not definitively established and varies greatly depending on the specific preparation (e.g., extract, tea, candy) and the intended use.  There is no standardized dosage recommendation for medicinal purposes.  It's essential to consult a healthcare professional before using licorice for medicinal purposes to determine an appropriate dose and to avoid potential adverse effects.  Always follow the instructions on any product label carefully.  Using licorice in high doses or for prolonged periods can lead to serious side effects (see below).


### Side Effects
* **Common:**  Mild gastrointestinal upset (nausea, heartburn, diarrhea)
* **Less Common, but Serious:**  Elevated blood pressure (hypertension), low potassium levels (hypokalemia), fluid retention (edema), muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias.  These effects are primarily associated with prolonged high-dose use due to the mineralocorticoid-like effects of glycyrrhizic acid.
* **Other Potential Side Effects:** Headaches, allergic reactions (skin rash, itching).


**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, discontinue use and seek medical attention immediately.


### How it Works
Liquorice's primary active compound, glycyrrhizic acid, is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2).  This enzyme normally converts cortisol (a glucocorticoid hormone) into cortisone (an inactive form) in the kidneys. By inhibiting 11β-HSD2, licorice increases the amount of active cortisol in the body, leading to increased mineralocorticoid activity (similar to the effects of aldosterone).  This explains the fluid retention, hypertension, and hypokalemia associated with high licorice intake.  The demulcent and expectorant effects are likely due to its ability to increase mucus production and soothe irritated tissues. The exact mechanisms behind its potential antispasmodic and ulcer-healing properties remain to be fully elucidated.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Liquorice should be avoided by individuals with hypertension, heart failure, kidney disease, hypokalemia, or those taking potassium-depleting medications.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Liquorice can interact with several medications, including diuretics, corticosteroids, and cardiac glycosides.  It may also affect the effectiveness of some drugs metabolized by the liver.  Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications and supplements you are taking before using licorice.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of licorice during pregnancy and breastfeeding is uncertain.  It’s best to avoid using it during these periods unless specifically advised by a healthcare professional.
* **Children and Older Adults:**  Liquorice should be used cautiously in these populations, as they may be more susceptible to its side effects.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long can I use licorice?**  A:  Long-term or high-dose use of licorice can lead to serious side effects.  Use it only for short periods unless directed by a doctor.
* **Q: Where can I buy licorice?**  A:  Liquorice root is available in many health food stores, herbal shops, and online retailers.  Be aware of product purity and potency.
* **Q: Is licorice safe for everyone?**  A:  No. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using licorice, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**  A: Stop using licorice and seek medical attention.
* **Q: Is licorice the same as licorice root extract?** A: While both come from the same plant, extracts are concentrated versions of the root, potentially containing higher amounts of active compounds and thus carrying greater risk of side effects.
