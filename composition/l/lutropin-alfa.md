# Lutropin Alfa
### Generic Name
Lutropin Alfa

### Usage
Lutropin alfa is a gonadotropin hormone used in the treatment of infertility in women.  Specifically, it's indicated for women aged 16 to 60 who have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) with profound luteinizing hormone (LH) deficiency (less than 1.2 units/L).  It's crucial to understand that lutropin alfa is not used alone; it's always administered in conjunction with follitropin alfa to stimulate follicular development and ultimately, ovulation.  This combined approach helps prepare the body for successful fertilization.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Females aged 16 to 60):**

The medication is administered subcutaneously (under the skin). The typical starting dose is 75 units per day until adequate follicular development is observed via ultrasound monitoring and/or serum estradiol levels.  The maximum daily dose is 75 units. Treatment should not exceed 14 days unless clear signs of imminent follicular development are present.  In some cases, the duration of stimulation may be extended up to 5 weeks, but this is determined on a case-by-case basis based on the patient's response in previous cycles.  

After the final dose of both lutropin alfa and follitropin alfa, a single dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is administered.  Daily intercourse is encouraged starting the day before hCG administration and continuing until ovulation is confirmed.  If ovarian enlargement or abdominal pain occurs, hCG should be withheld, lutropin alfa and follitropin alfa should be discontinued, and intercourse should be avoided.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

Lutropin alfa is not approved for use in children.  The safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

No specific dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Pain
* Ovarian cysts
* Flatulence
* Abdominal pain
* Dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation)
* Mastalgia (breast pain)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Fatigue
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Ovarian hyperstimulation
* Increased serum cholesterol
* Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT and AST)
* Injection site reactions

**Rare Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**  A wide range of less frequent side effects have been reported, including but not limited to ectopic pregnancy, thromboembolism, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).  This list is not exhaustive.

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to seek medical advice immediately.


### How it Works

Lutropin alfa is a recombinant form of luteinizing hormone (LH), produced using Chinese hamster ovary cells.  LH plays a vital role in female reproductive health.  When administered, lutropin alfa increases the secretion of estradiol from the follicles in the ovaries.  This rise in estradiol is essential for triggering follicular development, a necessary step for ovulation and subsequent fertilization.  The combined action of lutropin alfa and follitropin alfa (another gonadotropin) creates an optimal environment for follicle growth and maturation.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

Lutropin alfa is contraindicated in women with:

* Hypersensitivity to lutropin alfa or any component of the formulation.
* Primary ovarian failure.
* Uncontrolled thyroid or adrenal dysfunction.
* Untreated tumors of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland.
* Ovarian, uterine, or breast cancer.
* Abnormal uterine bleeding of unknown origin.
* Ovarian cysts or enlargement (unrelated to polycystic ovarian disease) of unknown origin.
* Malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy.
* Uterine fibroids incompatible with pregnancy.
* Pregnancy.
* Breastfeeding.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of neoplasms, ovarian enlargement, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), thromboembolism, porphyria, and multiple births.
* Careful monitoring is required to manage the risks associated with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).
* Patients should be informed about the risks of multiple pregnancies before starting treatment.
* Treatment should be discontinued if there is a high risk of multiple pregnancies.


### FAQs

**Q: How is lutropin alfa administered?**

A: Lutropin alfa is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in the abdomen or thigh. Injection sites should be rotated.  The solution should not be shaken; allow any bubbles to settle before injection.

**Q: How long does treatment typically last?**

A:  Treatment duration varies depending on individual response, but generally doesn't exceed 14 days unless follicular development is clearly imminent.  In some cases, it may be extended to 5 weeks.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**

A:  If you experience any side effects, particularly concerning ones, contact your doctor immediately.


**Q: Can I use lutropin alfa while pregnant or breastfeeding?**

A: No. Lutropin alfa is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

**Q: How should I store lutropin alfa?**

A:  Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific storage guidelines.  Generally, medications should be stored as directed to maintain their effectiveness and safety.

**Q: Is lutropin alfa suitable for everyone with infertility?**

A: No. It's specifically indicated for women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and profound LH deficiency.  Your doctor will assess your individual condition to determine if it's the appropriate treatment.
