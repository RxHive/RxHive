# Lanthanum Carbonate
### Generic Name
Lanthanum Carbonate

### Usage
Lanthanum carbonate is primarily used to lower high levels of phosphate in the blood (hyperphosphatemia) in adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).  ESRD is a severe stage of kidney failure where the kidneys are no longer able to adequately filter waste and excess minerals from the blood.  High phosphate levels are a common complication of ESRD and can contribute to serious health problems, including damage to blood vessels and bones.  Lanthanum carbonate helps manage this by binding to phosphate in the digestive tract, preventing its absorption into the bloodstream.  It's specifically designed for this purpose and isn't typically used for other phosphate-related issues.

### Dosage

**Adults (with ESRD):**

* **Oral:** The starting dose is typically 750-1500 mg per day, divided into multiple doses.  The dose is adjusted gradually (usually by 750 mg increments every 2-3 weeks) until the phosphate levels in the blood reach a target range (generally below 6.0 mg/dL).  Most individuals require a total daily dose of 1500-3000 mg to achieve this goal.  The exact dosage should always be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and blood phosphate levels.

**Children:**

Lanthanum carbonate is not recommended for use in children.  This is because lanthanum can accumulate in developing bones, and the long-term effects of this are not fully understood.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

No specific dose adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with liver or kidney impairment, although caution is advised in those with liver problems.  Always consult a doctor for personalized dosage recommendations.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients or reported after marketing):**

* Abdominal pain
* Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium)


**Rare but Serious Side Effects (less than 1% or reported in case studies):**

* Allergic skin reactions
* Constipation
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Fecal impaction
* Gastrointestinal perforation (a hole in the digestive tract)
* Hypophosphatemia (low blood phosphate)
* Intestinal obstruction (blockage)
* Tooth injury (with chewable tablets)


If any adverse effects occur, consult a doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Lanthanum carbonate works by binding to phosphate ions in the digestive tract. This binding action prevents the phosphate from being absorbed into the bloodstream, thereby reducing the level of phosphate in the blood.  It's a non-absorbable phosphate binder, meaning it's eliminated from the body largely unchanged.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Lanthanum carbonate should not be used in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to lanthanum or any of the ingredients. It's also contraindicated in cases of bowel obstruction, fecal impaction, or ileus (intestinal blockage).
* **Interactions:**  Lanthanum carbonate can interact with several medications, potentially decreasing their absorption and effectiveness. These medications include quinolone antibiotics, levothyroxine, certain antimalarials, tetracyclines, statins, mycophenolate mofetil, ACE inhibitors, and ampicillin.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking before starting lanthanum carbonate.  Depending on the interacting medication and its importance, dose adjustments, timing changes, or alternative medications may be necessary.
* **Warnings:** Use caution in patients with gastrointestinal diseases or biliary obstruction.  It's recommended to avoid this medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding, as it crosses the placenta, and its presence in breast milk is unknown.  Other phosphate binders should be considered in these situations.
* **General:** Take lanthanum carbonate with or immediately after meals.  If taking other oral medications, try to separate their administration from Lanthanum carbonate to minimize potential interaction. The exact separation interval may vary for different medications.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take lanthanum carbonate with other medications?** A:  No. Lanthanum carbonate can interfere with the absorption of several other medications.  Always talk to your doctor or pharmacist before combining it with any other prescription or over-the-counter drugs, herbs, or supplements.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.


* **Q: How should I store lanthanum carbonate?** A: Store it as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep it out of reach of children.


* **Q: Can I stop taking lanthanum carbonate without talking to my doctor?** A: No. Always discuss any changes to your medication regimen with your doctor.  Stopping abruptly might cause a sudden increase in blood phosphate levels.


* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with lanthanum carbonate?** A: Long-term studies are still ongoing.  However,  lanthanum deposition in bones has been observed.  Regular monitoring of blood levels of calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone is necessary to detect and manage any complications.
