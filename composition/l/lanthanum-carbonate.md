# Lanthanum Carbonate

**Generic Name:** Lanthanum Carbonate

**Usage:**

Lanthanum carbonate is used to reduce high levels of phosphorus in the blood (hyperphosphatemia) in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are on dialysis.  High phosphorus levels can lead to serious health problems, including bone disease and cardiovascular issues.  It works by binding to phosphorus in the digestive tract, preventing its absorption into the bloodstream.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Constipation:** This is a very frequent side effect and often requires management with increased fluid and fiber intake, or stool softeners.
* **Nausea:**  Some patients experience nausea, which may improve with time or dose adjustment.
* **Vomiting:** Less common than nausea, but can occur.
* **Abdominal pain or discomfort:**  This can range from mild to moderate.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Blockage in the intestines (bowel obstruction):** This is a rare but serious complication.
* **Alkalosis (high blood pH):** This is a disruption of the body's acid-base balance.


**How it Works:**

Lanthanum carbonate is a phosphate binder.  It works in the gastrointestinal tract by binding to dietary phosphorus, forming an insoluble complex that is then eliminated in the stool.  This prevents the absorption of phosphorus into the bloodstream, thereby lowering serum phosphorus levels.  It's crucial to take this medication with meals or snacks containing phosphorus to maximize its effectiveness.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is lanthanum carbonate taken?**  A: It is typically taken as tablets or capsules with meals or snacks containing phosphorus.  The exact dosage and frequency will be determined by your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q:  Are there any foods or medications I should avoid while taking lanthanum carbonate?** A:  Your doctor or pharmacist may advise on specific dietary modifications. Generally, it is essential to maintain consistent phosphorus intake, but avoid exceptionally high phosphorus meals without adjusting the medication dose.  Some medications may interact with lanthanum carbonate, so it's crucial to inform your doctor and pharmacist about all medications and supplements you're taking.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of taking lanthanum carbonate?** A: Long-term use may have some effects on the gastrointestinal system, hence regular monitoring is recommended. Your doctor should monitor your calcium and phosphorus levels regularly to check the efficacy of the treatment and to detect any side effects.

* **Q: Can I take lanthanum carbonate if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: The use of lanthanum carbonate during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with your doctor. The risks and benefits need to be carefully weighed.
