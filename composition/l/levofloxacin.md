# Levofloxacin
### Generic Name
Levofloxacin

### Usage
Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolone class.  Its primary use is in treating various bacterial infections.  This includes infections of the lungs (like pneumonia and bronchitis), sinuses (sinusitis), urinary tract (cystitis, pyelonephritis), skin and soft tissues (cellulitis, abscesses), and bones and joints.  It's also sometimes used to treat certain types of eye infections and anthrax (in specific circumstances and under close medical supervision).  It's important to remember that levofloxacin is only effective against bacterial infections; it won't work against viral infections like the common cold or flu.  The decision to use levofloxacin should always be made by a healthcare professional, considering the specific infection and the patient's overall health.

### Dosage
Levofloxacin dosage varies depending on the type and severity of the infection, the patient's age and weight, and the method of administration (oral or intravenous).  Always follow your doctor's prescription precisely.  

* **Oral Administration (Tablets, Suspension):**  Typical adult dosages range from 250mg to 750mg once or twice daily, depending on the infection.  Dosage for children is determined by weight and is generally not recommended unless other antibiotics are ineffective.  

* **Intravenous Administration (Injection):**  Intravenous dosages are typically higher than oral dosages and are administered by a healthcare professional. The specific dosage and duration depend on the severity of the infection.  

Specific dosage instructions will be provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Never adjust the dosage without consulting your healthcare provider.  

### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, insomnia, and abdominal pain.  These are usually mild and temporary.

* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Tendinitis (inflammation of the tendons), tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage), seizures,  QT interval prolongation (heart rhythm abnormality),  photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight), liver damage, and allergic reactions (ranging from rash to anaphylaxis).

* **Important Note:** If you experience any of the less common serious side effects, particularly tendon pain,  severe allergic reaction, or changes in your heart rhythm, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Levofloxacin works by inhibiting the action of an enzyme called DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are essential for bacterial DNA replication and cell division.  By blocking these enzymes, levofloxacin prevents bacterial growth and eventually leads to their death.  This targeted mechanism makes it a relatively effective antibiotic against a wide range of bacteria.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Levofloxacin should not be used in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to fluoroquinolones or any of its components.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Levofloxacin can interact with several other medications, including antacids, caffeine, and some blood thinners.  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Warnings:** Levofloxacin is associated with an increased risk of tendon damage, particularly in older adults and patients taking corticosteroids.  It can also cause central nervous system effects, such as seizures, and may worsen existing neurological conditions.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits of levofloxacin with their healthcare provider before use.  Avoid exposure to direct sunlight during treatment due to increased photosensitivity.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking levofloxacin when I feel better?**  A: No, it is crucial to complete the entire prescribed course of levofloxacin, even if you feel better. Stopping early can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking levofloxacin?** A:  While there's no absolute contraindication, moderate alcohol consumption might increase the risk of some side effects.  It's best to avoid alcohol or limit it significantly while on levofloxacin.  Consult your doctor for specific advice.

* **Q: How should I store levofloxacin?**  A: Store levofloxacin at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Is levofloxacin safe for children?** A:  Levofloxacin is generally not recommended for children due to a higher risk of adverse effects, including cartilage damage.   Alternatives are usually preferred.  Only a doctor can assess if its use is appropriate in a child with a severe infection and only after considering alternative options.
