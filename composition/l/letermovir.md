# Letermovir
### Generic Name
Letermovir

### Usage
Letermovir is an antiviral medication specifically designed to prevent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease.  Its primary use is in adult recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) who are CMV-seropositive (meaning they have been previously exposed to and carry the CMV virus).  This preventative measure is crucial because these individuals are at significantly higher risk of developing severe CMV infections due to their compromised immune systems after the transplant.  Currently, there are no approved uses of letermovir in children.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (CMV Prophylaxis in HSCT recipients):**

*   The standard dose is 480 mg once daily (OD).
*   Administration can be either intravenously (IV) or orally.
*   Treatment begins between day 0 and day 28 post-allogeneic HSCT.
*   The medication is usually continued for a total of 100 days post-transplant.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and efficacy of letermovir have not been established in children.  Therefore, it is not currently recommended or approved for use in pediatric populations.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

*   **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A or B).  However, letermovir is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
*   **Renal Impairment:**  For adults with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) above 10 mL/minute, no dosage adjustment is typically necessary.  However, caution is advised when using the intravenous formulation in patients with CrCl below 50 mL/minute, as there’s a potential for accumulation of the intravenous vehicle (hydroxypropyl betadex).  Specific dosage adjustments for patients with CrCl ≤ 10 mL/minute or those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis are not provided in the manufacturer's labeling.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

*   Headache
*   Fatigue
*   Peripheral edema
*   Nausea
*   Diarrhea
*   Vomiting
*   Abdominal pain
*   Decreased platelet count
*   Cough

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

*   Tachycardia
*   Atrial fibrillation
*   Decreased hemoglobin level


**Rare Side Effects (<1%):**

*   Hypersensitivity reactions


It is crucial to report any new or worsening symptoms to a healthcare provider.  These are not all the possible side effects of letermovir.

### How it Works

Letermovir is a potent antiviral agent that specifically targets cytomegalovirus (CMV). It works by inhibiting the CMV DNA terminase complex, a crucial enzyme involved in the viral DNA replication process.  By blocking this enzyme, letermovir prevents the virus from creating new copies of its genetic material, thus inhibiting viral replication and assembly of new viral particles. This ultimately prevents the spread of CMV and its ability to cause infection.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Letermovir should not be used concurrently with pimozide or ergot alkaloids, nor with pitavastatin and simvastatin when these are also being used with cyclosporine.
*   **Renal Impairment:** Use caution in patients with renal impairment, particularly those with CrCl < 50 mL/min when using the IV formulation.
*   **Pregnancy:** Letermovir may cause embryo-fetal developmental toxicity.  Use during pregnancy only if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.
*   **Breastfeeding:** It's unknown whether letermovir is excreted in breast milk.  The decision to breastfeed while taking letermovir should consider the potential infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding, and the benefits of the medication for the mother.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take letermovir with food?** A: The oral formulation can be taken with or without food.
*   **Q: How is the IV formulation administered?** A: The IV formulation should be infused over one hour via a peripheral or central venous catheter. Do not administer as an IV bolus.  It must be diluted before use following the manufacturer's instructions.
*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on how to proceed if you miss a dose of letermovir.
*   **Q: How should I store letermovir?** A: Store letermovir according to the instructions on the label. Typically, it involves keeping it at room temperature.
*   **Q: Does letermovir work against other viruses?** A: No, letermovir is only active against CMV; it does not affect other herpes viruses like HSV.  Additional prophylaxis may be needed.
*   **Q: Can I develop resistance to letermovir?** A: Yes, resistance can develop due to mutations in the UL56 gene of CMV. However, cross-resistance with other CMV drugs like ganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet is unlikely.
