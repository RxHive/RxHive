# Levodropropizine
### Generic Name
Levodropropizine

### Usage
Levodropropizine is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of a non-productive cough.  This means it's effective for coughs that don't produce mucus.  It works by suppressing the cough reflex, helping to reduce the frequency and intensity of coughing. It's important to note that levodropropizine treats the symptom (cough) and not the underlying cause of the cough.  If you have a cough that's accompanied by other symptoms like fever, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, you should consult a doctor to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Immediate-release tablets:** The usual dose is 60 mg up to three times daily (TID), given at intervals of at least 6 hours apart.  The maximum daily dose is 180 mg.
* **Extended-release tablets:**  The usual dose is 90 mg twice daily (BID).

**Children (2-12 years):**

The dosage for children is weight-based and should be determined by a healthcare professional.  Generally:

* **Immediate-release concentrated solution/drops (30 mg/mL):** 1 mg/kg per dose, up to three times daily (TID), at intervals of at least 6 hours.  The maximum single dose is 60 mg, and the maximum daily dose is 3 mg/kg/day, not to exceed 120 mg.
* **Immediate-release syrup (30 mg/5mL):** 1 mg/kg per dose, up to three times daily (TID), at intervals of at least 6 hours.  The maximum single dose is 60 mg (10 mL), and the maximum daily dose is 3 mg/kg/day, not to exceed 180 mg (30 mL).

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustments are specifically recommended for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Levodropropizine is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

### How it Works

Levodropropizine works by suppressing the cough reflex at the periphery of the nervous system.  It reduces the excitability of the receptors in the tracheobronchial area (the airways in your lungs) that trigger the cough response.  This decreases the urge to cough without directly affecting mucus production.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Levodropropizine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, pregnant women, breastfeeding women, patients with increased bronchial secretions or impaired mucus clearance (like Kartagener syndrome), those with severe hepatic impairment, and children under 2 years old.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment, severe heart failure, and diabetes.  Levodropropizine may cause drowsiness or altered consciousness, so avoid activities requiring alertness (like driving or operating machinery) until you know how it affects you.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While significant interactions are not widely reported, it is always best to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications you are taking to avoid any potential interactions.
* **Specific Populations:**  Pregnancy and breastfeeding are contraindicated; use in children under 2 years old is contraindicated. Use with caution in older adults.
