# Levocetirizine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Generic Name:** Levocetirizine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or other upper respiratory allergies.  Levocetirizine is an antihistamine that relieves runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes. Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant (an antitussive) that helps reduce coughing.  It's important to note that it treats *symptoms*, not the underlying cause of the illness.  It's typically used for coughs that are non-productive (dry coughs).  It is not effective for coughs that produce mucus (productive coughs).

**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include:

* **From Levocetirizine:** drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, fatigue, dizziness.  Less common but more serious side effects include increased heart rate, seizures, and allergic reactions.
* **From Dextromethorphan:** drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation.  Less common but more serious side effects include allergic reactions, hallucinations (especially in high doses or with certain other medications), and increased risk of seizures.


**How it Works:**

* **Levocetirizine:** This is a selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist.  Histamine is a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  By blocking histamine, levocetirizine reduces the symptoms of allergies.
* **Dextromethorphan:** This is a centrally acting antitussive. It works in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to affect neurotransmitters involved in cough signaling.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take this medication with other drugs?**  You should always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting this combination drug.  It can interact negatively with other medications, especially those that cause drowsiness (e.g., sedatives, opioid pain relievers) or affect the central nervous system.  MAO inhibitors should also be avoided.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Alcohol can worsen the drowsiness caused by both levocetirizine and dextromethorphan.  Avoid alcohol while taking this medication.
* **How long can I take this medication?**  Do not take this medication for longer than recommended by your doctor or as indicated on the label.  Consult a healthcare professional if your symptoms persist or worsen after a reasonable time.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **What should I do if I overdose?**  Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect an overdose.
