# Losartan + Amlodipine

**Generic Name:** Losartan Potassium/Amlodipine Besylate

**Usage:**

Losartan Potassium/Amlodipine Besylate is a combination medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It combines two different types of blood pressure medications:

* **Losartan Potassium:** An angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).  It works by relaxing blood vessels, making it easier for blood to flow.
* **Amlodipine Besylate:** A calcium channel blocker. It also relaxes blood vessels and slows down the heart rate, reducing blood pressure.

This combination is often prescribed when a single medication isn't enough to control blood pressure effectively.  It may be used alone or in conjunction with other medications to manage hypertension.  It's crucial to take this medication exactly as prescribed by your doctor.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Swelling in ankles or feet
* Cough (less common than with ACE inhibitors)

Less common, but more serious side effects, require immediate medical attention and include:

* Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema) â€“ a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.
* Irregular heartbeat
* Chest pain
* Shortness of breath
* Severe dizziness or fainting
* Yellowing of skin or eyes (jaundice)
* Muscle pain or weakness


This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects vary among individuals.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

Losartan and amlodipine work through different mechanisms to lower blood pressure:

* **Losartan:** Blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, losartan allows blood vessels to relax and widen, reducing blood pressure.
* **Amlodipine:** Blocks the entry of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This relaxation reduces the force of the heart's contractions and widens blood vessels, leading to lower blood pressure.


The combination of these two medications provides a more comprehensive approach to blood pressure control, often achieving better results than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Alcohol can lower blood pressure, so it's best to limit alcohol consumption or avoid it altogether while taking this medication, especially at the start of treatment.  Consult your doctor for specific advice.

* **Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** No.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a sudden rise in blood pressure, potentially causing serious health problems.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Can I take this medication with other medications?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking, as there may be interactions.

* **What are the potential long-term effects?** Long-term use is generally safe when taken as prescribed. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and kidney function is crucial.

* **Is this medication safe during pregnancy?**  This medication is generally not recommended during pregnancy. Discuss this with your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
