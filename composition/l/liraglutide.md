# Liraglutide
### Generic Name
Liraglutide

### Usage

Liraglutide is a medication primarily used to improve blood sugar control in adults and children (aged 10 years and older) with type 2 diabetes. It's used alongside diet and exercise.  Importantly, it's also shown to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, cardiovascular death) in adults with type 2 diabetes who already have established heart disease.  Beyond diabetes management, liraglutide is indicated for chronic weight management in adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m² or higher (obesity) or a BMI of 27 kg/m² or higher (overweight) if they also have at least one weight-related health problem like high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol.

### Dosage

**Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:** Liraglutide is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  For adults and children aged 10 years and older, the initial dose is typically 0.6 mg once daily for one week to minimize potential gastrointestinal side effects.  After the first week, the dose is increased to 1.2 mg daily.  If further blood sugar control is needed, the dose can be increased to 1.8 mg daily after at least one week at the 1.2 mg dose.

**Chronic Weight Management:** For adults, the initial dose is 0.6 mg daily for one week, followed by a gradual increase to a target dose of 3 mg daily in 0.6 mg increments weekly, until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.  For children aged 12 years and adolescents up to 17 years, the initial dose is 0.6 mg daily, and it's titrated upward to a maximum of 3 mg daily in 0.6 mg weekly increments. Treatment should be discontinued if a 4-5% weight loss is not observed after 12-16 weeks. 

**Missed Doses:** For missed doses in weight management, simply resume the next scheduled dose. Do not take a double dose.  If more than three days have passed, restart at 0.6 mg to avoid gastrointestinal discomfort.  For type 2 diabetes, consult your doctor for advice on missed doses.


**Important Notes:** Liraglutide should not be mixed or used concurrently with other GLP-1 receptor agonists or (in the case of weight management) insulin.  It is not for use in type 1 diabetes or for treating diabetic ketoacidosis.

### How it Works

Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. This means it mimics the action of GLP-1, a natural hormone that helps regulate blood sugar.  Liraglutide works in several ways:

*   It increases the release of insulin from the pancreas only when blood sugar levels are high.
*   It decreases the release of glucagon, a hormone that raises blood sugar.
*   It slows down the emptying of the stomach, which helps to prevent blood sugar spikes after meals.  These combined actions lead to improved blood sugar control and weight loss.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Liraglutide is contraindicated in individuals with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2),  a history of serious hypersensitivity to liraglutide, and pregnancy (for weight management).
*   **Interactions:**  Liraglutide may enhance the effects of other blood sugar-lowering medications like insulin and sulfonylureas, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Close monitoring is needed if using these medications concurrently.
*   **Warnings:**  Liraglutide may increase the risk of pancreatitis, gallbladder problems, and thyroid tumors.  It can also cause or worsen depression and suicidal thoughts.  Patients should be monitored closely for these potential risks.  Use caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Liraglutide is not recommended during pregnancy, particularly for weight management.  It's unclear whether liraglutide is excreted in breast milk; caution is advised during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How do I store liraglutide?** A: Store liraglutide in the refrigerator, but do not freeze.  Keep it away from light and heat.

*   **Q:  Can I stop taking liraglutide suddenly?** A:  No, it's important to gradually reduce the dose under the guidance of your doctor to prevent potential adverse effects.  Sudden cessation should be avoided.

*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, particularly those listed above as serious side effects.

*   **Q: Is liraglutide suitable for everyone with type 2 diabetes?** A: No, liraglutide is not suitable for everyone. Your doctor will determine if it's the right medication for you based on your medical history and current health status.

*   **Q: How long does it take to see results from liraglutide?** A:  The time it takes to see results varies depending on the individual and the indication.  For weight loss, significant changes may not be evident until several weeks or months into treatment. For blood sugar control, improvements are generally observed more rapidly.

*   **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking liraglutide?** A: While there are no direct contraindications, excessive alcohol consumption is generally discouraged as it can interfere with the management of diabetes and may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.  Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with a healthcare professional.
