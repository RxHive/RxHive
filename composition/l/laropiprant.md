# Laropiprant
### Generic Name
Laropiprant

### Usage

Laropiprant is a medication that was previously used in combination with nicotinic acid (niacin) to treat high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia).  Specifically, it was designed to reduce or prevent the flushing (redness and warmth of the skin) that is a common and often bothersome side effect of high-dose niacin therapy.  It's important to note that this combination product is no longer available because studies showed it offered no significant advantage over statin therapy alone and had a higher rate of adverse effects.  Laropiprant is not used as a standalone medication for cholesterol management.

### Dosage

Because the combination product containing laropiprant and nicotinic acid is discontinued, there are no current dosage recommendations.  Information on specific dosages should not be referenced from outdated sources as it is no longer clinically relevant.  Any previous dosage information should be considered obsolete and unreliable for current medical guidance.

### Side Effects

Since laropiprant was only used in combination with nicotinic acid, separating its specific side effects from those of niacin is difficult.  The combination product was associated with an increased rate of adverse effects compared to statin therapy alone.  These included, but were not limited to:

*   Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Skin reactions (beyond flushing)
*   Liver function abnormalities


It's crucial to note that this list is not exhaustive.  If you experienced any adverse effects while taking a combination product containing laropiprant, consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works

Laropiprant works by blocking the prostaglandin D2 receptor (DP1).  Niacin, when used at high doses to lower cholesterol, increases the production of prostaglandin D2, a molecule that causes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), leading to the characteristic flushing. By blocking the DP1 receptor, laropiprant prevents prostaglandin D2 from binding and triggering vasodilation, thus reducing or preventing niacin-induced flushing.

### Precautions

Due to the discontinuation of the laropiprant/nicotinic acid combination, specific precautions are not readily available in the context of its current unavailability.  However, general precautions associated with nicotinic acid should be considered, such as the potential for liver damage and interactions with other medications.  Consult a healthcare professional for any concerns regarding interactions with other medications, especially if you are on multiple medications.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid any medication containing nicotinic acid unless specifically advised by a doctor.
