# Levocetirizine

**Generic Name:** Levocetirizine

**Usage:** Levocetirizine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies.  These symptoms include:

* Sneezing
* Runny nose
* Itchy, watery eyes
* Itching of the nose and throat
* Hives (urticaria)
* Itching
* Skin rash

It's also sometimes used to treat urticaria (hives) not caused by allergies.  It's available in both tablet and syrup forms.  Always follow the dosage instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Side Effects:**  Levocetirizine is generally well-tolerated, but some side effects can occur. These are usually mild and include:

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, fatigue, dizziness.
* **Less Common:** Nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, sore throat.
* **Rare:**  Serious allergic reactions (such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat),  fast heartbeat, seizures.


**How it Works:** Levocetirizine is a selective antagonist of peripheral H1-receptors.  In simpler terms, it blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  By blocking histamine, levocetirizine reduces the symptoms associated with allergies.


**FAQs:**

* **Is levocetirizine drowsy?** While less sedating than some older antihistamines, drowsiness can still occur, especially at higher doses.  It's best to avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.

* **Is levocetirizine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**  Consult your doctor before taking levocetirizine if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The effects of levocetirizine usually begin within 30-60 minutes of taking a dose.
* **Can I take levocetirizine long-term?** Long-term use is possible for chronic allergic conditions, but regular check-ups with your doctor are recommended.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** If you experience any serious side effects, such as difficulty breathing or swelling, seek immediate medical attention.  For less severe side effects, consult your doctor or pharmacist.
