# Levocetirizine
### Generic Name
Levocetirizine

### Usage

Levocetirizine is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives).  Allergic rhinitis symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose and eyes, and congestion.  Chronic idiopathic urticaria is characterized by persistent hives (itchy welts) and often intense itching. Levocetirizine works by blocking histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  It effectively targets these allergy symptoms, providing relief from itching, sneezing, and other related discomforts.  The medication is available for both adults and children, with dosage adjustments based on age and weight.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The usual adult dose for both allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria is 5 mg once daily, preferably in the evening.  Some individuals may find relief with a lower dose of 2.5 mg daily.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 5 mg.

**Children:** Dosage for children varies significantly based on age and the specific condition being treated. Always follow the instructions provided by a doctor or pharmacist.  Generally, children aged 6 months to 5 years might receive 1.25 mg daily, while older children (6-11 years) may take 2.5 mg daily. Children 12 years and older usually receive the same dose as adults.  Dosage forms include tablets and oral solutions (syrup).  It's crucial to use an accurate measuring device for liquid formulations; a household teaspoon is not precise enough.

**Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with reduced kidney function (renal impairment). The specific adjustments depend on the creatinine clearance (CrCl) rate.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist for guidance on appropriate dosage in these cases; levocetirizine is contraindicated in individuals with severe kidney disease (CrCl < 10 mL/minute).


### Side Effects

Common side effects of levocetirizine are generally mild and may include:

*   Drowsiness
*   Fatigue
*   Dry mouth
*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Nausea
*   Constipation
*   Diarrhea


Less common, but more serious side effects, although rare, can include:

*   Allergic reactions (such as skin rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
*   Fast heartbeat (tachycardia)
*   Seizures
*   Hallucinations
*   Agitation or unusual behavior

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.  Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have any concerns about side effects.

### How it Works

Levocetirizine is a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist. This means it blocks the action of histamine, a chemical messenger involved in allergic reactions.  Histamine causes the symptoms of allergies such as sneezing, itching, and runny nose. By blocking histamine's effects, levocetirizine helps to alleviate these symptoms and provides relief from the discomfort of allergic reactions.  Levocetirizine is the active isomer of cetirizine and has a higher affinity for the H1 receptor.

### Precautions

*   **Allergy:** Do not take levocetirizine if you are allergic to it, cetirizine, or any of its ingredients.
*   **Kidney Disease:** Individuals with moderate to severe kidney disease require dosage adjustments.  Levocetirizine is contraindicated in patients with severe kidney impairment.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While generally considered safe, the use of levocetirizine during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a doctor to weigh the potential risks and benefits.
*   **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Levocetirizine may cause drowsiness; avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.
*   **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking levocetirizine, as it may increase the risk of drowsiness.
*   **Other Medications:**  Levocetirizine may interact with other medications. Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take levocetirizine with other allergy medications?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist before combining levocetirizine with other allergy medications to avoid potential interactions.
*   **Q: How should I store levocetirizine?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
*   **Q: Is levocetirizine habit-forming?** A: No, levocetirizine is not habit-forming.
*   **Q:  How long does it take for levocetirizine to work?** A:  The onset of effect can vary, but relief from symptoms is typically noticeable within an hour of taking the medication.
