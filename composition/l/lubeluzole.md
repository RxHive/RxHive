# Lubeluzole
### Generic Name
Lubeluzole

### Usage
Lubeluzole is a neuroprotectant that was investigated for the treatment of ischemic stroke.  Its primary intended use was to reduce the damage to brain tissue caused by a lack of blood flow following a stroke.  While initial studies suggested promise,  further development was discontinued due to insufficient efficacy in larger clinical trials.  It is not currently approved for medical use.

### Dosage
Because Lubeluzole is not currently approved for medical use, there are no established dosage recommendations for adults or children.  The studies conducted explored various dosage ranges, but none resulted in approval for clinical application. Any information about specific dosages found in older research should not be interpreted as a prescription or guide for self-medication.

### Side Effects
While Lubeluzole was generally well-tolerated at low doses in clinical trials, potential side effects included:

* **Common:**  (The frequency of these was not established due to discontinuation of development, and may vary based on dosage.)
* **Serious (but less common at lower doses):**  Prolongation of the QTc interval (a measure of heart function), potentially leading to serious heart rhythm disturbances.  This side effect was a major factor in halting further development.

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any adverse effects, even if they seem minor, you should immediately consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works
Lubeluzole acts as an indirect NMDA receptor antagonist.  This means it doesn't directly block the NMDA receptor (a type of receptor involved in nerve signal transmission), but rather it inhibits the release of glutamate, a neurotransmitter that over-excites these receptors during a stroke. By reducing glutamate release, it also indirectly inhibits the production of nitric oxide. Additionally, it blocks certain calcium and sodium ion channels, contributing to its neuroprotective effects. The overall aim was to limit the extent of neuronal cell death following a stroke.

### Precautions
Since Lubeluzole is not an approved medication, specific precautions for vulnerable groups like pregnant women, children, or the elderly are not established.  The critical safety concern identified during research was the risk of QTc prolongation and subsequent cardiac arrhythmias at higher doses.  It is crucial to emphasize that Lubeluzole should **not** be used without explicit guidance from a physician.  There is no safe or effective use outside of controlled research settings.

### FAQs

* **Q: Is Lubeluzole available for purchase?**
A: No, Lubeluzole is not currently approved for medical use and is therefore not available for purchase through regular pharmaceutical channels.

* **Q:  What were the reasons for the failure of Lubeluzole clinical trials?**
A:  While showing promise in early trials, Lubeluzole ultimately failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy in larger-scale clinical trials to justify its approval. The risk of QTc prolongation at higher doses also significantly limited its potential.


* **Q:  Can I take Lubeluzole to treat my stroke?**
A:  No, absolutely not.  Lubeluzole is not approved for the treatment of stroke or any other condition.  Using it without medical supervision is extremely dangerous.  Consult a physician for appropriate stroke treatment.

* **Q: Where can I find more information about Lubeluzole?**
A: You can find more information by searching scientific databases like PubMed for research publications on Lubeluzole.  However, remember that this information is primarily from research studies and does not constitute medical advice.  Always consult a healthcare professional for any health concerns.
