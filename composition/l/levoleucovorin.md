# Levoleucovorin
### Generic Name
Levoleucovorin

### Usage
Levoleucovorin is primarily used in the treatment of advanced, metastatic colorectal cancer, typically in combination with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy regimens.  It's a crucial component in enhancing the effectiveness of fluorouracil while mitigating some of its toxic effects.  

Beyond its use in cancer treatment, levoleucovorin serves as a vital antidote to counteract the toxicity associated with overdoses of folic acid antagonists like methotrexate.  This is particularly important in situations where methotrexate elimination is impaired or when high-dose methotrexate therapy has been administered.  In these cases, levoleucovorin acts as a "rescue agent," helping to prevent or lessen severe side effects from methotrexate.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific condition being treated and the patient's characteristics.  Intravenous (IV) administration is the standard route.  It's crucial to consult prescribing information for precise dosing instructions.  Below are examples, *not* a complete guide:

**Adults:**

* **Metastatic Colorectal Cancer:**  Dosages vary widely depending on the specific chemotherapy regimen.  For example, in combination with fluorouracil, dosages might range from 10 mg/m² to 100 mg/m² per day over several days, repeated in cycles. A common regimen uses levoleucovorin at half the dose of leucovorin calcium. Some regimens combine it with other drugs (like oxaliplatin and irinotecan).

* **High-dose Methotrexate Rescue:** The typical dosage is 7.5 mg every 6 hours for 10 doses, starting 24 hours after the methotrexate infusion. However, this is highly individualized and depends heavily on methotrexate levels and renal function. Doses may be increased and the duration of treatment extended based on methotrexate blood levels and kidney function monitoring.

* **Methotrexate Overdose or Impaired Elimination:** Similar to rescue, the dose is adjusted based on methotrexate and creatinine levels, often requiring higher doses and more frequent administration.  Aggressive hydration and urinary alkalinization are crucial elements of management in these instances.

**Children:**

Pediatric dosing for high-dose methotrexate rescue and impaired elimination is often the same as the adult dose,  but always under strict medical supervision and based on the child's weight and overall health.

**Important Note:** The information provided here is a simplified overview.  Dosage must be determined and adjusted by a qualified healthcare professional based on individual patient factors.

### Side Effects

Levoleucovorin, while generally well-tolerated, can cause side effects.  The frequency and severity vary depending on the dosage and the patient's overall health.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea and vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Mouth sores (stomatitis)
* Fatigue
* Loss of appetite
* Skin rash
* Alopecia (hair loss)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe allergic reactions
* Renal insufficiency
* Neurologic effects (confusion, neuropathy)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Levoleucovorin is a folate analog, meaning it's structurally similar to folic acid (vitamin B9).  Folic acid is essential for DNA synthesis and cell division.  Folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, work by blocking the action of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme necessary for the activation of folic acid. This leads to interference with DNA synthesis and cell growth, which is beneficial in cancer therapy but toxic to normal cells.

Levoleucovorin, in its active form, bypasses the blocked step and provides the body with the necessary folate cofactor. This action is used therapeutically in two ways.  Firstly, it "rescues" cells from the toxic effects of high doses of methotrexate, thus reducing its side effects. Secondly, it enhances the anti-cancer effect of fluorouracil by increasing the amount of FdUMP, an active fluorouracil metabolite that inhibits tumor growth.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Individuals with a known allergy to levoleucovorin, folic acid, or any components of the formulation should not use it.
* **Drug Interactions:** Levoleucovorin can interact with other medications, especially those used to treat seizures (like phenytoin or phenobarbital) and some other cancer drugs.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Levoleucovorin falls under pregnancy category C, indicating potential risks to the fetus.  Use during pregnancy is generally avoided unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  The excretion of levoleucovorin in breast milk is unknown.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Patients with kidney problems may require dose adjustments due to the risk of methotrexate accumulation.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** There is limited information on dosage adjustments in patients with liver disease.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take levoleucovorin without a doctor's prescription?** A: No. Levoleucovorin is a prescription-only medication. Always consult your healthcare provider before using it.
* **Q: How should I store levoleucovorin?** A: Store according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically at room temperature and away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor for guidance.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Is levoleucovorin safe for long-term use?** A:  The safety of long-term use depends on the reason for its use and should be monitored closely by a doctor.
* **Q: Can levoleucovorin cause birth defects?** A: As a category C drug, there's a potential risk, so pregnancy should be avoided or carefully managed while using this medication.
