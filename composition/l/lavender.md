# Lavender
### Generic Name
Lavender

### Usage
Lavender, derived from the *Lavandula* plant, is primarily used for its calming and relaxing properties.  Its essential oil is commonly employed in aromatherapy to alleviate anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Historically, and in some alternative medicine practices, lavender has also been used to address digestive issues, acting as a mild cholagogue (promoting bile flow).  However, it's crucial to note that the scientific evidence supporting these uses beyond aromatherapy is limited, and further research is needed to fully understand its efficacy in treating specific conditions.  Lavender's use should be discussed with a healthcare professional before incorporating it into a treatment plan.


### Dosage
There isn't a standardized dosage for lavender as a medication. The use of lavender varies widely depending on its form and intended application.  Aromatherapy typically involves inhaling the essential oil diluted in a carrier oil or using it in diffusers.  Topical application, such as in creams or lotions, is also common.  Internal use of lavender, though less prevalent due to a lack of robust research, may involve consuming it as a tea (infusion) or in other forms.  Dosage recommendations for internal use are not well-established and vary widely depending on the preparation, making it essential to consult a healthcare professional for guidance.  Children and pregnant or breastfeeding individuals should exercise particular caution and seek professional advice before using lavender in any form.


### Side Effects
While generally considered safe when used topically or aromatically in appropriate dilutions, some individuals may experience adverse effects. These include:

* Headache
* Constipation

Serious side effects are rare, but potential allergic reactions can occur.  Any unusual or concerning symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
The precise mechanism by which lavender exerts its effects is not fully understood.  However, it's hypothesized that lavender may interact with NMDA receptors in the brain, influencing neurotransmitter activity. This interaction might contribute to its calming and relaxing effects observed in aromatherapy and related applications.  Further research is needed to fully elucidate the complex biological pathways involved.


### Precautions
* **Allergic Reactions:** Individuals with known allergies to plants in the *Lamiaceae* family (mint family) should exercise caution and may be more susceptible to allergic reactions.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Limited data exists on interactions between lavender and other medications.  Consult a healthcare professional if taking other medications, particularly those affecting the central nervous system.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of lavender during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not definitively established.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before using lavender.
* **Children:**  Use in children should be carefully considered, and guidance from a pediatrician is crucial.
* **Internal Use:**  Internal use of lavender requires caution due to the lack of well-defined dosages and potential for adverse effects if not properly prepared and administered.
