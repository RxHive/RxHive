# Lactase
### Generic Name
Lactase (or beta-galactosidase)

### Usage
Lactase is an enzyme primarily used to treat lactose intolerance.  Lactose intolerance occurs when the body doesn't produce enough lactase, the enzyme needed to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products.  Without sufficient lactase, lactose remains undigested in the intestines, leading to symptoms like bloating, gas, and diarrhea. Lactase supplements help break down lactose into simpler sugars (glucose and galactose) that the body can easily absorb, alleviating these symptoms.  In infants, lactase may also be used to manage colic potentially related to lactose intolerance in breastfed or formula-fed babies.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the product form (capsules, liquid drops, tablets) and the individual's needs.  Always follow the instructions on the product label or consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

**Adults (Lactose Intolerance):**

* **Capsules:** Typically 1-2 capsules taken with milk or a meal, or 1-2 capsules added per quart of milk before consumption.
* **Liquid:** Usually 5-15 drops per quart of milk.
* **Tablets:**  3000-9000 units (1-3 tablets) with the first bite of food containing dairy.  Additional doses might be needed if dairy consumption continues after 30-45 minutes.

**Children (Lactose Intolerance):**

* Tablets: 3000-9000 units with the first bite of food containing dairy.  Dosage adjustments for children should be guided by a pediatrician.

**Infants (Colic, potentially related to lactose intolerance):**

* **Breastfed infants:** Add 4 drops of lactase infant drops to a few tablespoons of expressed breast milk at body temperature before feeding. Continue breastfeeding as usual.
* **Formula-fed infants:** Add 4 drops of lactase infant drops to a warm (not hot) prepared formula. Wait 30 minutes, shaking occasionally, before feeding.  The formula should be at body temperature.  High heat will destroy the enzyme's activity. Note: The drops are added *after* the formula is prepared and at body temperature; do not boil the formula with lactase already mixed in.


### Side Effects
Lactase supplements are generally well-tolerated. However, some individuals may experience:

* Mild gastrointestinal discomfort (e.g., gas, bloating) â€“ this is usually less severe than symptoms experienced without lactase.
* Allergic reactions (rare), such as rash, itching, or swelling.

Serious side effects are uncommon.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe allergic reactions or unusual symptoms.


### How it Works
Lactase works by breaking down lactose, a disaccharide (a type of sugar molecule composed of two simpler sugars), into its constituent monosaccharides: glucose and galactose.  These simpler sugars are then easily absorbed into the bloodstream in the small intestine, preventing the symptoms associated with lactose intolerance.


### Precautions
* **Phenylketonuria (PKU):** Lactase supplements are contraindicated in individuals with PKU due to the potential presence of phenylalanine in some formulations. Always check the product label for phenylalanine content.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe during pregnancy (Category A), it's advisable to consult a doctor before taking lactase during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known.  However, always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Storage:** Store lactase supplements according to the manufacturer's instructions to maintain their efficacy.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take lactase with other medications?** A: Generally, no significant interactions are known, but it is always best to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking to avoid any potential interactions.
* **Q: How long does it take for lactase to work?** A: The effects are typically felt within minutes to a few hours after consumption with dairy.
* **Q: Can I take more lactase than recommended?** A: No, exceeding the recommended dosage does not necessarily improve effectiveness and might lead to unnecessary side effects. Always follow the instructions on the label or as directed by your healthcare professional.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of using lactase?** A: Long-term use of lactase is generally considered safe, however if you have long-standing concerns, it is always best to discuss with your medical professional.
* **Q: What if I forget a dose?** A: Take it as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose.
