# Lactase

**Generic Name:** Lactase (also known as Î²-galactosidase)  Note:  There isn't a single "generic" lactase drug name like there is for, say, ibuprofen.  Lactase is an enzyme, and various brands offer lactase enzyme supplements.

**Usage:**  Lactase supplements are used to treat lactose intolerance. They are taken to help digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products.  This can prevent or alleviate symptoms such as bloating, gas, cramping, and diarrhea that occur when someone with lactose intolerance consumes dairy.  They can be taken before, during, or after consuming dairy products, depending on the product formulation (e.g., tablets taken before, drops added to milk).

**Side Effects:** Lactase supplements are generally considered safe. However, some individuals may experience mild side effects such as:

* Gas (though often less than without lactase)
* Nausea
* Mild stomach upset

These side effects are usually mild and temporary.  Severe side effects are rare.

**How it Works:** Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down lactose into simpler sugars, glucose and galactose.  People with lactose intolerance have insufficient levels of lactase in their small intestine, preventing the proper digestion of lactose.  Taking a lactase supplement provides the missing enzyme, allowing the lactose to be broken down and absorbed, thereby reducing or eliminating symptoms of lactose intolerance.

**FAQs:**

* **How much lactase should I take?** The appropriate dosage varies depending on the brand, product formulation, and the amount of lactose you are consuming. Always follow the instructions on the product label or consult with your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Are there different types of lactase supplements?** Yes, lactase supplements come in various forms, including tablets, capsules, liquid drops, and powders.  The best type for you will depend on your preferences and needs.
* **Can I take lactase supplements long-term?** Yes, lactase supplements can be taken long-term if needed to manage lactose intolerance.
* **Are there any interactions with other medications?**  Generally, lactase supplements don't interact significantly with other medications. However, it's always best to inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications.
* **Is lactase the same as yogurt with live cultures?** No.  Yogurt with live and active cultures contains bacteria that *may* help some people digest lactose, but it does not contain added lactase enzyme.  The effect of yogurt varies significantly between individuals.
* **Can I eat dairy without lactase if I'm lactose intolerant?**  Some individuals with mild lactose intolerance can tolerate small amounts of dairy without symptoms, but many need lactase supplementation to avoid digestive distress.
