# Loxoprofen
### Generic Name
Loxoprofen

### Usage

Loxoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.  Its main applications include treating various conditions characterized by joint inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. It's also effective for other musculoskeletal inflammatory processes causing pain in the neck, shoulder, arm, and back.  Loxoprofen finds further use in post-operative and post-traumatic pain management, following tooth extraction, and in managing acute inflammatory processes of the upper respiratory tract (sometimes accompanied by acute bronchitis).  Note that specific indications may vary depending on the formulation (oral or topical).


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies depending on the condition and formulation.

* **Oral:** For conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, back pain, and periarthritis, the typical oral dose is 60 mg three times daily (TID).  For acute conditions, a single dose of 60-120 mg may be used. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 180 mg.  For acute upper respiratory tract inflammation, the usual dose is 60 mg once daily (OD), with a maximum daily dose of 120mg (two 60mg doses). Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response and age.

* **Topical (Patch):** For osteoarthritis, myalgia, and post-traumatic swelling and pain, a patch containing 100 mg of Loxoprofen sodium hydrate is applied once daily (OD) to the affected area.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Loxoprofen is **not recommended** for children under 18 years of age as its safety in this population has not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Individuals with hepatic or renal impairment require careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments.  Severe hepatic or renal dysfunction contraindicates Loxoprofen use.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Insomnia
* Numbness
* Palpitations
* Elevated blood pressure
* Stomach discomfort
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea and/or vomiting
* Anorexia
* Rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Anemia
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Increased liver enzyme levels (AST, ALT, ALP)
* Hematuria (blood in urine)
* Proteinuria (protein in urine)
* Fever
* Edema (swelling)


Less common but serious side effects include:  shock, anaphylactoid reactions, serious blood disorders, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, interstitial nephritis, congestive cardiac failure, interstitial pneumonia, severe peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding, GI perforation, and hepatic failure.  Seek immediate medical attention if any serious side effects occur.


### How it Works

Loxoprofen inhibits the production of prostaglandins, inflammatory substances in the body responsible for pain and inflammation.  It works by blocking the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, crucial for prostaglandin synthesis. After oral administration, Loxoprofen is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and quickly metabolized into its active form, which then effectively inhibits prostaglandin production at the site of inflammation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Loxoprofen is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, aspirin-induced asthma, peptic ulcers, severe blood disorders, severe hepatic or renal impairment, severe cardiac failure, during the late stages of pregnancy, and breastfeeding women.  It's also contraindicated in children under 18.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Concurrent use with second-generation quinolone antibiotics (like ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin) may increase the risk of seizures.  Loxoprofen may also increase the plasma concentration of warfarin, methotrexate, sulfonylurea derivatives, and lithium salts.  Caution is advised when co-administering these medications.

* **Warnings:** Patients with a history of peptic ulcers, blood disorders, hepatic or renal impairment, hypersensitivity, bronchial asthma, cardiac dysfunction, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease should use Loxoprofen with caution under close medical supervision.  Elderly patients may also require careful monitoring.  The drug should be used cautiously during pregnancy (especially early stages) and is absolutely contraindicated during the final trimester.
