# Liquid Paraffin
### Generic Name
Liquid Paraffin

### Usage
Liquid paraffin, a pharmacologically inert viscous liquid, is primarily used for the temporary relief of occasional constipation. This can be achieved through oral or rectal administration.  A secondary use is the removal of barium sulfate residues after barium-based medical imaging procedures.  It's important to remember that liquid paraffin provides only temporary relief and is not a long-term solution for chronic constipation.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Constipation):**

* **Oral (Plain, non-emulsified):** 15-45 mL in 24 hours (maximum 45 mL/day), taken as a single dose (preferably at bedtime) or in divided doses.
* **Oral (Suspension/Emulsion):** 30-90 mL daily (maximum 90 mL/day), taken as a single dose or in up to 3 divided doses.
* **Rectal (Fleet mineral oil):** 118 mL as a single dose.

**Do not use for more than one week without consulting a doctor.**

**Pediatric Dosage (Constipation):**

Dosage varies significantly depending on the child's age and the method of administration (oral or rectal).  Always follow the specific instructions on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.  The following are general guidelines, and precise amounts should be confirmed with a doctor or pharmacist:

* **Children aged 2 to <6 years:** Rectal administration usually involves half the contents of a 4.5 oz bottle as a single dose.  Oral administration is generally not recommended for this age group.
* **Children aged 6-11 years:** Oral dosages are typically lower than adult doses, ranging from 5-15 mL/day (plain) or 10-30 mL/day (emulsion). Rectal administration might involve half the contents of a 4.5 oz bottle.
* **Children aged ≥12 years and adolescents:** Dosages approach adult levels, but should always be determined by a healthcare provider.  

**Pediatric Dosage (Barium Sulfate Residue Removal):**

* **Children aged 2-11 years:** Rectal administration of half the contents of a 4.5 oz bottle.
* **Children aged ≥12 years and adolescents:** Rectal administration of the full contents of a 4.5 oz bottle.

**Pediatric Dosage (Fecal Impaction):**

* **Oral (slow disimpaction):** 3 mL/kg twice daily for 7 days.
* **Rectal:**  Half a 4.5 oz bottle for children aged 2-11 years, and a full 4.5 oz bottle for those aged 12 years and older.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using liquid paraffin in such cases.


### Side Effects

* Abdominal cramps
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Anal leakage (leading to itching, irritation, hemorrhoids, and perianal discomfort – especially with large doses)
* Lipid pneumonitis (serious, but rare; occurs with aspiration)

**Note:** If any adverse effects occur, stop using liquid paraffin and consult a doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Liquid paraffin acts as a fecal softener and lubricant. It doesn't stimulate bowel movements directly; instead, it coats the stool, making it softer and easier to pass. This lubricating effect reduces friction and eases the elimination process, providing temporary relief from constipation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Oral use is contraindicated in children under 6 years of age, pregnant women, bedridden patients, elderly individuals, those with difficulty swallowing, and for usage exceeding one week.
* **Increased Risk:** There is an increased risk of lipid pneumonitis if liquid paraffin is aspirated (inhaled into the lungs).
* **Interactions:** Liquid paraffin can interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Concurrent use with these vitamins is not recommended.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Liquid paraffin is generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to potential interference with fat-soluble vitamin absorption.
* **General Considerations:** Avoid administering liquid paraffin with food to minimize the risk of aspiration. Prolonged use may reduce the absorption of lipid-soluble vitamins.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I use liquid paraffin?** A:  Do not use liquid paraffin for more than one week without consulting your doctor.  It is for temporary relief only.

* **Q: Can I take liquid paraffin with other medications?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist before combining liquid paraffin with other medications, particularly those containing fat-soluble vitamins.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop using liquid paraffin and contact your doctor immediately if you experience any adverse effects.

* **Q: How should I store liquid paraffin?** A: Store liquid paraffin at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.
