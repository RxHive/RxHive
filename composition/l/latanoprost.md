# Latanoprost

**Generic Name:** Latanoprost

**Usage:**

Latanoprost is used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  It's typically prescribed as eye drops.  It may be used alone or in combination with other medications to manage IOP.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Eye Irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness of the eye. These are usually mild and temporary.
* **Changes in Eye Color:**  Latanoprost can cause a gradual darkening of the iris (the colored part of the eye). This is usually more noticeable in patients with mixed-colored irides.  It's usually permanent and may not be noticeable in all individuals.
* **Eyelid Changes:**  Darkening of the eyelids, increased growth of eyelashes (longer, thicker, darker), and changes in the texture and color of the eyelashes.
* **Other possible side effects:**  Headache, eye pain, conjunctival hyperemia (redness of the conjunctiva â€“ the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye).


Rare but more serious side effects may occur and require immediate medical attention.  These include:

* **Macular edema (swelling of the macula - the central part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision):**  This is more likely to occur in patients with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms such as swelling of the face, lips, or throat.
* **Iritis (inflammation of the iris):**  Can cause pain, redness, and blurred vision.

**How it Works:**

Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analog. It works by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor (the fluid in the eye) from the eye, thereby lowering the intraocular pressure.  This helps to prevent damage to the optic nerve, which is essential for good vision.

**FAQs:**

* **How often should I use latanoprost?**  This is determined by your doctor and usually involves one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily, at bedtime.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not apply a double dose.
* **Can I use latanoprost with other eye drops?**  Consult your doctor or pharmacist.  There may be a necessary waiting period between applications of different eye drops to avoid dilution or interference.
* **Can I wear contact lenses while using latanoprost?**  It's generally advised to wait at least 15 minutes after applying latanoprost before inserting contact lenses.
* **Are there any precautions I should take?**  Inform your doctor of any allergies, medical conditions, or other medications you are taking.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with your doctor.
* **Can latanoprost cause long-term side effects?**  While most side effects are temporary, the iris color change and eyelid changes are generally permanent.  Long-term use may also increase the risk of macular edema in susceptible individuals.
