# Latanoprost
### Generic Name
Latanoprost

### Usage
Latanoprost is primarily used to treat elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).  High IOP is a major risk factor for glaucoma, a condition that can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss.  By lowering IOP, latanoprost helps protect the optic nerve and preserve vision.  While its primary use is in glaucoma, it's also used to treat ocular hypertension, a condition where IOP is higher than normal but not yet causing damage.


### Dosage
The typical dosage for adults and children (including infants) is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily, in the evening.  It's crucial to adhere to the once-daily dosage; exceeding this can actually decrease the effectiveness of the medication in lowering IOP.  The medication is administered ophthalmically, meaning it's applied directly into the eye.  There are currently no specific dosage adjustments recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, however caution is advised in these populations.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Foreign body sensation in the eye
* Eye pain
* Stinging of the eyes
* Ocular hyperemia (redness of the eye)
* Conjunctival hyperemia (redness of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inside of the eyelid)
* Eye discharge
* Increased eyelash length

Less common, but potentially more serious side effects (occurring in 1-10% or less), include:

* Erythema (redness) of the eyelid
* Hyperpigmentation (darkening) of eyelashes and iris
* Allergic skin reactions (including around the eyelid)
* Skin rash
* Blurred vision
* Increased eyelash thickness
* Iris hyperpigmentation (darkening of the iris)
* Decreased visual acuity
* Eyelid pain
* Lacrimation (increased tear production)
* Crusting of the eyelid
* Dry eye syndrome
* Photophobia (sensitivity to light)
* Eyelid edema (swelling)
* Conjunctival edema (swelling of the conjunctiva)
*  And other more serious side effects such as macular edema, iritis and uveitis.


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Latanoprost is a prostaglandin F2-alpha analog.  It works by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor, the fluid that fills the space between the iris and the cornea.  By increasing this outflow, the pressure inside the eye (IOP) is reduced, lessening the risk of damage to the optic nerve.


### Precautions
Latanoprost is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to latanoprost, benzalkonium chloride (a preservative often found in eye drops), or any other component of the formulation.

Use with caution in patients with:

* A history of intraocular inflammation (such as iritis or uveitis).
* A history of herpes simplex keratitis (inflammation of the cornea caused by the herpes simplex virus).
* Risk factors for macular edema (swelling of the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision).
* Aphakia (absence of the eye lens) or pseudophakia (presence of an artificial lens) with a torn posterior lens capsule.

Latanoprost may interact with other medications, particularly other prostaglandin analogs like bimatoprost, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), both systemic and ophthalmic.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are currently taking.  

During pregnancy and lactation, use only when clearly needed, using the lowest effective dose. The safety in pregnancy is not fully established.

### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for latanoprost to work?**

A:  The effect on IOP usually begins within a few hours, but the full effect may not be seen for several weeks.


**Q: Can I wear contact lenses while using latanoprost?**

A: Remove contact lenses before applying latanoprost and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.


**Q: How should I store latanoprost?**

A: Store latanoprost at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.


**Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A:  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.


**Q: Can I use latanoprost in both eyes if only one eye is affected?**

A:  Follow your doctor's instructions.  Latanoprost is typically used only in the affected eye(s) unless otherwise directed by your ophthalmologist.
