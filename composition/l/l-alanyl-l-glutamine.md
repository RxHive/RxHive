# L-alanyl-L-glutamine

**Generic Name:** L-alanyl-L-glutamine

**Usage:**

L-alanyl-L-glutamine is a dipeptide, meaning it's composed of two amino acids: L-alanine and L-glutamine, linked together.  Its primary use is as a nutritional supplement, particularly in medical settings.  Specific applications include:

* **Intestinal rehabilitation:** It's often used to support the gut lining and aid in recovery after intestinal injury or surgery.  It's believed to help repair the intestinal mucosa and improve gut barrier function.
* **Nutritional support:** It's used to provide a source of glutamine, an important amino acid, especially for individuals with impaired glutamine synthesis or increased glutamine requirements (e.g., critically ill patients, those with burns, or those undergoing chemotherapy).
* **Cancer treatment supportive care:** Some studies suggest it may help mitigate the side effects of chemotherapy, particularly mucositis (inflammation of the mucous membranes) and diarrhea.  However, further research is needed to confirm these benefits conclusively.

**Note:**  L-alanyl-L-glutamine is *not* a treatment for any specific disease but rather a supportive nutritional supplement.  It should not be considered a replacement for proper medical care.  Its use should always be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

**Side Effects:**

Generally, L-alanyl-L-glutamine is considered well-tolerated. However, some individuals may experience side effects, which are typically mild.  These can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal discomfort


More serious side effects are rare but possible and may include allergic reactions.

**How it Works:**

L-alanyl-L-glutamine works primarily by delivering glutamine to the cells in a more stable and readily absorbable form compared to free glutamine.  Free glutamine is rapidly metabolized in the body.  The dipeptide form protects the glutamine and allows for better intestinal absorption and delivery to cells needing it for various functions, including:

* **Intestinal mucosal repair:** Glutamine is a major fuel source for enterocytes (intestinal cells), supporting their growth and repair.
* **Immune function:** Glutamine is crucial for the proper functioning of the immune system.
* **Protein synthesis:**  Glutamine is a building block for proteins.


**FAQs:**

* **Is L-alanyl-L-glutamine the same as glutamine?** No, while it provides glutamine, it's a different compound.  The dipeptide form offers advantages in terms of stability and absorption.
* **Can I take L-alanyl-L-glutamine without a doctor's prescription?** While it's available as a supplement, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional before taking it, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.
* **What are the typical dosages?** Dosages vary widely depending on the individual's needs and condition.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage.
* **Are there any drug interactions?**  Potentially, though further research is needed to fully characterize all interactions.  It's vital to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Is it suitable for everyone?** No, it may not be suitable for individuals with certain medical conditions.  Always consult your doctor.
