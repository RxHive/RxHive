# Lactitol

**Generic Name:** Lactitol

**Usage:**

Lactitol is a sugar alcohol used primarily as a:

* **Laxative:**  It's used to treat constipation, softening stools and increasing their frequency.  It's often used for chronic constipation or to prepare the bowel for procedures like colonoscopy.
* **Dietary supplement:**  It can be used as a sugar substitute in foods and beverages for people with diabetes, as it has a lower glycemic index than sucrose (table sugar).  However, it still contains calories.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of lactitol include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** These are the most frequent side effects and include abdominal cramping, bloating, flatulence (gas), and diarrhea.  The severity often depends on the dosage.
* **Headache:**  Less common but can occur.


Less common, but potentially more serious side effects should be reported to a doctor immediately:

* **Severe diarrhea:** Leading to dehydration.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, symptoms like rash, itching, or swelling can occur.


**How it Works:**

Lactitol is a poorly absorbed sugar alcohol.  This means that a significant portion of it passes undigested into the large intestine. There, it:

* **Draws water into the bowel:**  This softens the stool and increases its bulk.
* **Acts as a prebiotic:**  It feeds beneficial bacteria in the gut, potentially improving gut health.  However, this effect is secondary to its laxative function.
* **Stimulates bowel movements:** This results in easier passage of stool.


**FAQs:**

* **Is lactitol safe for everyone?**  Generally, lactitol is safe for most adults when used as directed. However, it's crucial to consult a doctor before using it, especially if you have any underlying health conditions, are pregnant or breastfeeding, or are taking other medications.  People with fructose intolerance or other digestive problems may need to exercise caution.

* **How much lactitol should I take?** The dosage varies depending on the individual and the reason for use. Always follow the instructions on the product label or consult your doctor or pharmacist for appropriate dosage. Starting with a lower dose and gradually increasing it is often recommended to minimize side effects.

* **Can I use lactitol long-term?**  While lactitol can be used for extended periods to manage chronic constipation, it's generally recommended to consult a doctor for ongoing use to monitor for potential side effects and ensure the best management of constipation.

* **What are the interactions with other medications?**  Lactitol may interact with certain medications. It's vital to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all the medications and supplements you are taking before starting lactitol.

* **Can lactitol cause weight gain?**  While it contains calories, lactitol is less likely to cause weight gain than sucrose.  However, excessive consumption can still contribute to caloric intake.
