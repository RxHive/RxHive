# Lactitol
### Generic Name
Lactitol

### Usage
Lactitol is primarily used as an osmotic laxative to treat chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults.  It works by drawing water into the intestines, softening the stool and making it easier to pass.  While not its primary indication, lactitol has also seen off-label use in the management of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE), a condition affecting brain function due to liver disease.  In PSE, it helps regulate bowel movements, reducing the buildup of toxins in the body.

### Dosage
**Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC) in Adults:** The typical starting dose is 20 grams orally once daily. If loose stools persist, the dose should be reduced to 10 grams once daily.

**Portal Systemic Encephalopathy (PSE) in Adults (Off-Label Use):**  The starting dose is usually 0.5-0.7 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, divided into three doses.  The doctor will adjust the dosage based on individual response, aiming for two comfortable bowel movements daily.  Elderly patients may begin with a lower single dose of 6 grams, monitoring the response before increasing.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of lactitol in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before altering the dosage based on these or any other health factors.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in less than 10% of patients) may include:

* Flatulence (gas)
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal distension (bloating)
* Increased blood pressure
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Increased blood creatinine phosphokinase level

Less common, but potentially serious side effects have been reported post-marketing, including hypersensitivity reactions such as rash and itching.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Lactitol is a poorly absorbed sugar alcohol.  It acts as an osmotic laxative by drawing water into the intestines through osmosis. This increases the volume and softens the stool, stimulating bowel movements and relieving constipation.  In the case of PSE, this effect helps to reduce the accumulation of ammonia and other toxins in the gut, thereby improving brain function.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Lactitol is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction (blockage in the digestive tract) and galactosemia (a rare genetic disorder affecting sugar metabolism).

**Use with Caution:**  Lactitol should be used cautiously in elderly patients.

**Drug Interactions:** Lactitol may reduce the absorption of other medications taken orally.  Therefore, it is advisable to take other oral medications at least 2 hours before or after taking lactitol.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of lactitol during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  Consult a doctor before using lactitol if pregnant or breastfeeding.
