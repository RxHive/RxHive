# Levosalbutamol
### Generic Name
Levosalbutamol (also known as Levalbuterol)

### Usage
Levosalbutamol is a short-acting beta-2 receptor agonist (SABA) primarily used to treat or prevent bronchospasm in individuals with reversible obstructive airway diseases, most notably asthma.  It's a quick-relief medication, meaning it provides rapid relief from symptoms like wheezing and shortness of breath.  While its primary use is for acute asthma attacks, it can also be used for the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm.  It's important to note that levosalbutamol is not intended for long-term, daily maintenance of asthma;  its use beyond a couple of days a week for symptom control usually signifies the need for additional, longer-acting controller medications.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Bronchospasm (Inhaled):**  The usual dosage is 2 inhalations (90 mcg each) via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) every 4-6 hours as needed. Some patients may find 1 inhalation (45 mcg) every 4 hours sufficient. The maximum dose is generally 2 inhalations every 4 hours.  For nebulization, the starting dose is typically 0.63 mg three times daily (TID), potentially increased to 1.25 mg TID under close medical supervision. The maximum nebulized dose is usually 1.25 mg TID.

* **Acute, Severe Asthma Exacerbation (Inhaled):** During severe asthma attacks, higher doses may be necessary under medical supervision.  This might involve 4-8 inhalations (MDI) every 20 minutes for up to 4 hours, followed by 1-4 hourly dosing as needed.  Nebulized doses can range from 1.25-2.5 mg every 20 minutes for three doses, followed by 1.25-5 mg every 1-4 hours as required.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Pediatric dosages are significantly dependent on the child's age and weight and should always be determined by a healthcare professional.  Dosages are usually calculated per kilogram of body weight and administered via MDI or nebulizer, often with lower doses than adults, and with careful monitoring.  Always follow a doctor's precise instructions.  Levosalbutamol is generally not recommended for long-term daily maintenance therapy in children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with kidney problems, as levosalbutamol clearance might be reduced.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor, nervousness, dizziness.
* **Less Common, but Serious:**  Fast or irregular heartbeat (tachycardia), low potassium levels (hypokalemia), paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties), allergic reactions (including rash, hives, swelling, and anaphylaxis).
* **Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Levosalbutamol is a selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist. This means it primarily stimulates beta-2 receptors found in the lungs' smooth muscles.  Stimulating these receptors leads to increased levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) within the cells. This, in turn, causes relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscles, widening the airways and making it easier to breathe.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Levosalbutamol is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to levosalbutamol, albuterol (a related medication), or any components of the formulation.
* **Interactions:**  Concurrent use with beta-blockers should be avoided as beta-blockers can counteract levosalbutamol's effects and potentially cause severe bronchospasm.  Interactions are also possible with other sympathomimetics, diuretics, digoxin, MAO inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Specific Populations:** Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease (e.g., arrhythmias, coronary insufficiency, hypertension), diabetes, hyperthyroidism, hypokalemia, renal impairment, and seizure disorders.  Levosalbutamol's safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding isn't fully established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: Levosalbutamol usually starts to provide relief within a few minutes of inhalation.

* **Q: Can I use this for long-term asthma control?** A: No. Levosalbutamol is a rescue medication for quick relief of symptoms, not for daily maintenance.  Long-term use requires additional controller medications prescribed by a physician.

* **Q: How should I store levosalbutamol?** A: Store according to the directions on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Don't double up on doses.

* **Q: What should I do if I take too much?** A:  Contact your doctor or a poison control center immediately.  Overuse can lead to serious side effects.
