It doesn't treat specific diseases directly, but rather targets underlying nutritional deficiencies that may contribute to or worsen certain conditions.

Dosage will depend on the specific product, individual needs (based on age, weight, existing health conditions, and deficiency levels), and medical advice.  Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by your healthcare provider.  Blood tests may be used to determine the appropriate dosage and monitor effectiveness.  This is generally not given injectable form, but rather as tablets or capsules.
