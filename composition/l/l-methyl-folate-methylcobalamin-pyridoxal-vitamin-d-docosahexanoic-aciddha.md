# L-Methyl Folate + Methylcobalamin + Pyridoxal- + Vitamin D + Docosahexanoic acidDHA

**Generic Name:** L-Methylfolate, Methylcobalamin, Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3), and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) combination product.  (Note: There isn't a single generic name for this combination as it's not a standardized, pre-approved drug combination.  The names listed are the generic names of the individual components.)

**Usage:** This combination is often used to address deficiencies in the listed nutrients and support various bodily functions.  Specific uses might include:

* **Supporting neurological health:** Methylfolate, methylcobalamin, and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate are crucial for nerve function and the synthesis of neurotransmitters.  DHA is also essential for brain health.
* **Improving mood and cognitive function:**  Deficiencies in B vitamins (folate, B12, B6) are linked to mood disorders and cognitive impairment.
* **Supporting cardiovascular health:** DHA plays a role in maintaining healthy blood lipid levels.
* **Boosting immune function:** Vitamin D contributes to immune system regulation.
* **Supporting pregnancy health:**  Adequate folate, B12, and DHA are crucial for fetal development and reducing the risk of neural tube defects.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and depend on the individual dosage and overall health.  Possible side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, diarrhea, constipation, gas.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling.  (Rare)
* **Headache:**  More likely with higher doses of any of the components.
* **Sleep disturbances:**  Some individuals may experience sleep changes, especially with higher vitamin D doses.


**How it Works:**

* **L-Methylfolate (5-MTHF):** The biologically active form of folate, easily utilized by the body for various metabolic processes, including DNA synthesis and neurotransmitter production.
* **Methylcobalamin:** The active form of vitamin B12, crucial for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
* **Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate (P5P):** The active form of vitamin B6, involved in various metabolic pathways, including neurotransmitter synthesis and red blood cell formation.
* **Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3):** Important for calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and potentially mood regulation.
* **Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA):** An omega-3 fatty acid essential for brain structure and function, vision, and cardiovascular health.

This combination works synergistically.  For example, both folate and B12 are needed for the proper functioning of the homocysteine metabolic pathway.  Improper functioning of this pathway is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
