# Lactobacillus Gasseri
### Generic Name
Lactobacillus Gasseri

### Usage
Lactobacillus gasseri is a probiotic bacterium, primarily used to help restore a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut.  While research is ongoing, its main application is in supporting gut health and potentially assisting with conditions related to an imbalance in gut microbiota.  It's important to note that *Lactobacillus gasseri* is not a treatment for any specific disease, but rather a supportive measure to improve the overall gut environment.  One area of investigation is its potential role in managing Behcet's disease, although it's not currently a widely accepted treatment for this condition.

### Dosage
Dosage of *Lactobacillus gasseri* varies significantly depending on the specific product formulation.  There isn't a universally established standard dose. The instructions provided by the manufacturer on the specific product packaging should always be followed carefully.  Dosage forms typically include capsules or powders to be ingested.  Generally, it is recommended to take the product with food, often milk or water, as directed on the product label. Children's dosage should be determined based on their age and weight; always consult a healthcare professional before administering probiotics to children.


### Side Effects
*   Bloating
*   Flatulence (gas)

While generally considered safe, some individuals may experience mild gastrointestinal side effects.  More serious side effects are rare. If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works
*Lactobacillus gasseri* is a probiotic, meaning it introduces beneficial bacteria into the gastrointestinal tract. These bacteria help to compete with harmful bacteria, thereby restoring a healthy balance of the gut microbiota.  This helps to regulate digestion and potentially enhance the immune response within the gut.  The production of lactic acid by *Lactobacillus gasseri* also contributes to maintaining an acidic environment in the intestines, inhibiting the growth of many pathogenic bacteria.

* **Hypersensitivity:** Individuals with known hypersensitivity to *Lactobacillus acidophilus* or related components should avoid using *Lactobacillus gasseri*.
* **Immunocompromised Individuals:**  People with weakened immune systems should exercise caution and consult their doctor before taking *Lactobacillus gasseri*.  Probiotics can, in rare cases, cause problems for individuals with compromised immunity.
