# Levofloxacin (Oral Inhalation)
### Generic Name
Levofloxacin (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage
Levofloxacin oral inhalation is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used specifically to treat chronic pulmonary *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infections in adults (18 years and older) with cystic fibrosis.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is *not* a broad-spectrum antibiotic suitable for all bacterial infections. Its primary and essentially sole indication is this specific type of infection in this specific patient population.

### Dosage
**Adults (18 years and older with cystic fibrosis):**  The recommended dose is 240 mg (delivered as a 240 mg/2.4 mL solution) administered via inhalation every 12 hours. Treatment follows a cyclical pattern: 28 days of treatment are followed by 28 days without treatment.  Treatment cycles beyond six months (three consecutive cycles) are not supported by established safety and efficacy data.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Levofloxacin oral inhalation is not approved or recommended for use in children.  Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically necessary for patients with hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 20 mL/min or greater, no dosage adjustment is usually required. However, levofloxacin oral inhalation is *not recommended* for patients with a CrCl of less than 20 mL/min.

**Administration:** Levofloxacin oral inhalation solution should be administered using a nebulizer. The inhalation process should take approximately 5 minutes.  It's crucial *not* to mix this medication with other medications within the nebulizer. If a patient uses multiple inhaled medications, the recommended order is: bronchodilators, dornase alfa, airway clearance techniques, levofloxacin, and then inhaled steroids.  If acute bronchospasm occurs after administration, a short-acting bronchodilator can be used 15 minutes to 4 hours before subsequent levofloxacin doses.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (Frequency >10%):**

* Dysgeusia (altered taste)

**Side Effects (Frequency 1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Fatigue, headache, speech disturbance
* Cardiovascular: Chest discomfort
* Dermatologic: Skin rash
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting
* Respiratory: Cough, increased bronchial secretions, hemoptysis, respiratory congestion, thickening of bronchial secretions, sputum discoloration, dyspnea, paranasal sinus hypersecretion, and reduced forced expiratory volume (FEV1)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Frequency <1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**  These include, but are not limited to:  abnormal liver function tests (ALT, AST), aphonia, arthropathy, blurred vision, bronchospasm, various skin reactions, chest pain, various headaches, changes in appetite, decreased exercise tolerance, decreased lung function, diarrhea, dizziness, dysphagia, dyspnea on exertion, ECG abnormalities, epistaxis (nosebleed), fever, flu-like symptoms, fungal or bacterial superinfections, gastroesophageal reflux disease, increased serum creatinine, insomnia, jitteriness, joint stiffness, limb pain, various respiratory infections, migraine, muscle fatigue, nasal congestion,  onychomycosis, oral candidiasis, various oral discomforts, pharyngeal erythema, plantar fasciitis, pruritus (itching), rales, retching, rhinorrhea (runny nose), sinus headache, skin blisters, sneezing, tendonitis, throat irritation, tunnel vision, upper abdominal pain, urine discoloration, various infections, weight loss, and wheezing.

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If any adverse effects occur, seek medical advice immediately.


### How it Works
Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that works by inhibiting two essential bacterial enzymes: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.  These enzymes are crucial for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. By inhibiting these enzymes, levofloxacin prevents bacterial DNA from properly functioning, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death and the resolution of infection.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Levofloxacin oral inhalation is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to levofloxacin, other quinolones, or any component of the formulation. It's also contraindicated in patients with a history of tendonitis or tendon rupture associated with quinolone use.

**Warnings:**  This medication carries a risk of altered cardiac conduction, bronchospasm, cough, various central nervous system effects (including toxic psychosis, increased intracranial pressure, tremor, restlessness, etc.), crystalluria, altered glucose regulation, hemoptysis, severe hepatotoxicity, severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), ophthalmic effects, peripheral neuropathy, phototoxicity, seizures, and serious adverse reactions such as tendinitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and neuropsychiatric effects.  Superinfections (like *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea) are also possible.

**Use with Caution:**  Levofloxacin should be used cautiously in patients with unstable psychiatric illness, those predisposed to seizures, patients with renal impairment, and patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  It can exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis, thus its use should be avoided in these patients.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take levofloxacin oral inhalation for any bacterial infection?**  A: No, this medication is specifically indicated for chronic pulmonary *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infections in adults with cystic fibrosis.  It's not suitable for treating other bacterial infections.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop taking the medication and contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.
