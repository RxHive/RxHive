# Lenvatinib
### Generic Name
Lenvatinib

### Usage
Lenvatinib is a targeted cancer therapy, specifically a kinase inhibitor.  Its primary use is in treating several types of advanced cancers that have not responded well to other treatments.  These include:

* **Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC):** Lenvatinib is used for locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive DTC that doesn't respond to radioactive iodine.
* **Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC):**  It's used to treat advanced RCC after one prior antiangiogenic therapy, typically in combination with everolimus.
* **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC):** Lenvatinib is a first-line treatment option for unresectable (inoperable) HCC.
* **Endometrial Carcinoma:** Lenvatinib is used in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of advanced endometrial carcinoma that has progressed after prior systemic therapy and isn't suitable for surgery or radiation.  This is specifically in patients whose tumors are not microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient.


### Dosage

Lenvatinib dosage varies considerably depending on the type of cancer being treated and the patient's weight.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare professional's prescribed dosage exactly.  The medication is typically administered orally once daily (OD).

**Adults:**

* **Differentiated Thyroid Cancer:**  24 mg OD
* **Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (with everolimus):** 18 mg OD
* **Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma:** 12 mg OD for patients weighing â‰¥60 kg; 8 mg OD for patients weighing <60 kg.
* **Advanced Endometrial Carcinoma (with pembrolizumab):** 20 mg OD


**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of lenvatinib in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are often necessary based on factors such as kidney or liver function, and the presence of side effects.  These adjustments are determined and managed by a physician, who will consider factors such as severity and type of side effects and the patient's overall health.  Refer to the detailed prescribing information for specific guidelines on dosage modifications in cases of renal or hepatic impairment or adverse reactions.

### Side Effects

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. Consult your healthcare provider for a complete list of potential side effects and to discuss any concerns.

### How it Works

Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor.  RTKs are proteins on the surface of cells involved in cell growth and division.  Lenvatinib works by blocking the activity of several different RTKs, including those involved in the growth of blood vessels (angiogenesis) that feed tumors. By inhibiting these RTKs, lenvatinib slows or stops the growth of cancer cells and reduces the blood supply to tumors.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Lenvatinib is contraindicated in patients with a known allergy to lenvatinib or any of its components.
* **Cardiac Issues:** Lenvatinib can increase the risk of heart problems, including high blood pressure, heart failure, and irregular heartbeat.  Patients with pre-existing heart conditions should be carefully monitored.
* **Bleeding:** Lenvatinib can increase the risk of bleeding.  Patients with bleeding disorders should use caution.
* **High Blood Pressure:** Careful monitoring of blood pressure is needed, and treatment for hypertension may be necessary.
* **Liver and Kidney Function:**  Regular monitoring of liver and kidney function is crucial because lenvatinib can affect these organs.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Lenvatinib is harmful to a developing fetus.  Effective contraception is essential during treatment and for at least 30 days afterward.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for at least one week after the final dose.
* **Drug Interactions:** Lenvatinib can interact with other medications. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose and it's been less than 12 hours until your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time.  If more than 12 hours have passed, contact your doctor for advice.
* **Q: How should I store lenvatinib?** A: Store lenvatinib at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of lenvatinib?** A: The long-term effects of lenvatinib are not fully known.  Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is essential to detect and manage potential long-term side effects.
