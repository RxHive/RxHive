# Lenvatinib

**Generic Name:** Lenvatinib

**Usage:** Lenvatinib is a targeted therapy used to treat several types of cancer.  Its specific uses include:

* **Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC):**  Specifically, it's used for progressive, locally advanced or metastatic DTC, often after other treatments have failed.
* **Renal cell carcinoma (RCC):**  Used to treat advanced RCC, often in combination with everolimus.
* **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):** Used to treat advanced HCC, often in combination with other therapies.
* **Other cancers:**  It's also being studied in clinical trials for other cancer types.  The specific usage will always depend on the individual patient and their cancer type and stage.  **It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for the appropriate use of lenvatinib.**

**Side Effects:** Lenvatinib, like many cancer treatments, can cause a range of side effects.  These can vary in severity from person to person. Some common side effects include:

* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  This is a very common and sometimes serious side effect.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.

* **Severe liver injury:**


This is not an exhaustive list, and more serious side effects are possible.  It's vital to report any new or worsening symptoms to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Lenvatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by blocking the activity of certain enzymes called tyrosine kinases, which are involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. By inhibiting these enzymes, lenvatinib can slow or stop the growth of cancer cells.  It targets multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, FGFR1-4, PDGFRÎ±, KIT, RET, and others.  This multi-targeted approach contributes to its effectiveness against various cancer types.

**FAQs:**
