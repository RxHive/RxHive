# Live Attenuated Varicella-Zoster Virus
### Generic Name
Live Attenuated Varicella-Zoster Virus Vaccine

### Usage
The live attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine is primarily used to prevent chickenpox (varicella).  Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the VZV virus, characterized by an itchy rash with fluid-filled blisters.  The vaccine is highly effective in preventing the disease and significantly reduces its severity in cases where it does occur.  

This vaccine is also used to prevent shingles (herpes zoster), a reactivation of the VZV virus that lies dormant in the body after a chickenpox infection.  While not directly preventing initial chickenpox infection in adults, the vaccine is crucial for reducing the risk of developing shingles later in life, particularly for individuals over 50 years old, where the risk is significantly higher.


### Dosage

**Chickenpox Prevention:**

* **Children (12 months - 12 years):**  Two doses are typically recommended. The first dose is usually given between 12 and 15 months of age, followed by a second dose between 4 and 6 years old.  The specific timing might vary slightly depending on the vaccination schedule recommended by the healthcare provider and public health guidelines.
* **Adolescents and Adults (13 years and older):** Two doses are recommended, given at least 4 weeks apart if not previously vaccinated.  Individuals who have had chickenpox in the past typically don't require vaccination.

**Shingles Prevention:**

* **Adults 50 years and older:** A single dose is typically recommended.  The specific vaccine used for shingles prevention might differ slightly from the one used for chickenpox prevention, though both utilize a live attenuated VZV virus.


**Administration:**

The vaccine is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) by injection.  Oral forms of this vaccine are not available.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site are common.  Mild fever, rash, and fatigue may also occur.  These side effects are usually temporary and mild.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** While rare, serious side effects are possible, including allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), and, though extremely rare,  disseminated varicella (widespread chickenpox).  
* **Important Note:** If any serious or unusual side effects occur after receiving the vaccine, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

The live attenuated VZV vaccine contains a weakened form of the varicella-zoster virus.  After vaccination, this weakened virus triggers the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. These antibodies provide protection against future infection by the wild-type VZV virus. The vaccine essentially mimics a natural infection without causing the illness itself.  The body develops immunity without suffering from the symptoms of chickenpox.  Similarly, for shingles prevention, the vaccine helps boost immunity and reduces the risk of VZV reactivation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  The vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with severely compromised immune systems (e.g., due to HIV infection, cancer treatments, or certain medications), pregnant women, and individuals with a history of severe allergic reaction to the vaccine or its components.
* **Interactions:**  There are some interactions with other medications, especially those that suppress the immune system.  It's vital to discuss all medications and supplements with a healthcare provider before vaccination.
* **Warnings:**  Individuals with a history of blood disorders or bleeding problems should consult a doctor before receiving the vaccine.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I get chickenpox from the vaccine?** A:  It's highly unlikely. The virus in the vaccine is weakened and cannot cause typical chickenpox. A very mild rash may occur, but it is rarely severe.

* **Q: How long does the protection last?** A: Protection from chickenpox is generally long-lasting but may wane over time, hence the recommendation for two doses in childhood.  Protection against shingles conferred by the vaccine also diminishes over time, hence the recommendation for revaccination in older adults.

* **Q: How should I store the vaccine?** A:  The vaccine must be stored at the recommended temperature (usually refrigerated) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Improper storage can render the vaccine ineffective.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.
