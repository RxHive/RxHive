# Levocetirizine + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine + Sodium Citrate

**Generic Name:** Levocetirizine + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine + Sodium Citrate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  The specific ingredients target different symptoms:

* **Levocetirizine:**  An antihistamine that helps relieve allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.  It's particularly effective against allergic rhinitis.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** A pain reliever and fever reducer. It helps to alleviate headaches, muscle aches, and fever.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving nasal congestion.
* **Sodium Citrate:** Acts as a buffer to help stabilize the formulation and may help to reduce the acidity of the preparation.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects may include:

* **Levocetirizine:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, fatigue, headache, dizziness.
* **Paracetamol:**  Rarely causes side effects at recommended doses.  Overdosing can cause serious liver damage.
* **Phenylephrine:** Increased blood pressure, nervousness, headache, insomnia, nausea.
* **Sodium Citrate:** Generally well-tolerated, but may cause gastrointestinal upset in some individuals.

Serious side effects are rare but possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:  allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), severe dizziness, chest pain, rapid heartbeat, or unusual bleeding.

**How it Works:**

* **Levocetirizine:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.
* **Paracetamol:** Reduces fever by affecting the area of the brain that regulates body temperature.  It also relieves pain through unknown mechanisms, possibly by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.
* **Phenylephrine:** Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in blood vessels, causing them to constrict and reduce swelling in the nasal passages.
* **Sodium Citrate:**  As mentioned earlier, primarily acts as a buffer in the formulation.
