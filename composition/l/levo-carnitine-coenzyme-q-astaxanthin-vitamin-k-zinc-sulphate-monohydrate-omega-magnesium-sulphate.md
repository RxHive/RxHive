**Usage:**

This combination of ingredients targets several aspects of cellular health and energy production.  Each component has its own established uses, and the theory behind combining them is to provide broad support for overall well-being.

* **Levo-carnitine:** Primarily used to support energy production, particularly in the heart and brain. It may be helpful in certain metabolic disorders.

* **Astaxanthin:** A powerful antioxidant with potential anti-inflammatory effects.  Research suggests possible benefits for eye health, skin health, and immune function.
* **Vitamin K:** Essential for blood clotting and bone health.  Deficiencies can lead to bleeding disorders and weak bones.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:**  Zinc is a crucial mineral involved in numerous bodily functions, including immune function, wound healing, and cell growth.
* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Essential fatty acids with anti-inflammatory properties. They play a vital role in brain function, heart health, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases.
* **Magnesium Sulphate:** Magnesium is involved in hundreds of enzyme reactions in the body. It's important for muscle and nerve function, blood sugar control, and blood pressure regulation.
