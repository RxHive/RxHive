# Levonadifloxacin

**Generic Name:** Levofloxacin

**Usage:** Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, including:

* **Respiratory tract infections:** Bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis
* **Skin and skin structure infections:** Cellulitis, abscesses
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** Cystitis, pyelonephritis
* **Anthrax:** (post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment)
* **Other infections:**  Some types of bone and joint infections


**Important Note:**  Levofloxacin is a *reserve antibiotic*, meaning it's generally used only when other, less potent antibiotics have failed or are unsuitable.  Its use is restricted due to concerns about antibiotic resistance and potential serious side effects.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can range from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation
* **Nervous system:** Headache, dizziness, insomnia, restlessness, anxiety
* **Musculoskeletal:** Tendinitis, tendon rupture (particularly Achilles tendon), joint pain, muscle pain
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives, swelling (angioedema), difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis) â€“ seek immediate medical attention if these occur.


**Less common but serious side effects:**

* **Central nervous system effects:** Seizures, confusion, hallucinations, depression
* **Cardiovascular:**  Prolonged QT interval (can lead to irregular heartbeat)
* **Hepatic:** Liver damage (rare but serious)
* **Renal:** Kidney problems
* **Photosensitivity:** Increased sensitivity to sunlight


**How it Works:** Levofloxacin works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for DNA replication and repair.  By blocking these enzymes, levofloxacin prevents bacterial growth and ultimately leads to bacterial cell death.


**FAQs:**
