# Lorlatinib
### Generic Name
Lorlatinib

### Usage
Lorlatinib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults.  This treatment is specifically for patients whose tumors have been identified as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive through an FDA-approved test.  This means the cancer cells have a genetic alteration involving the ALK gene, making them particularly susceptible to Lorlatinib's mechanism of action.  Currently, it is not approved for use in children.

### Dosage
The standard adult dosage of Lorlatinib is 100 mg once daily (OD), orally, until disease progression or unacceptable side effects necessitate discontinuation or dose adjustment.  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with certain conditions.

* **Renal Impairment:** For patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) between 15 and 29 mL/min, the dose should be reduced to 75 mg OD.  Dosage adjustments for end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis are not specified in the manufacturer’s labeling.  For CrCl 30-89 mL/min, no dose adjustment is needed.

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin levels within normal limits and AST levels above normal, or bilirubin levels 1-1.5 times the upper limit of normal with any AST level), no dose adjustment is required. Dosage adjustments for moderate and severe hepatic impairment are not specified in the manufacturer’s labeling.

* **Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions:** Lorlatinib dosage may be reduced based on the severity of side effects.  The initial dose is 100mg. This can be reduced to 75mg or 50mg, or therapy can be discontinued entirely depending on the reaction. Specific recommendations exist for managing side effects such as CNS effects, hypercholesterolemia/hypertriglyceridemia, atrioventricular (AV) block, interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, hypertension, and hyperglycemia.  Consult a healthcare provider immediately for guidance on managing adverse effects.


### Side Effects
Lorlatinib, like many cancer therapies, can cause side effects.  Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Nervous system: Cognitive dysfunction, dizziness, fatigue, headache, mood changes, peripheral neuropathy, sleep disturbances, and speech problems.
* Cardiovascular: Chest pain, edema, and hypertension.
* Gastrointestinal: Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and increased serum lipase.
* Dermatologic: Skin rash.
* Endocrine & Metabolic:  Hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, increased amylase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels, and weight gain.
* Hematologic: Anemia, lymphocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, and thrombocytopenia.
* Hepatic: Increased serum ALT, ALP, and AST levels.
* Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, back pain, increased creatine phosphokinase, limb pain, and myalgia.
* Ophthalmic: Visual disturbances.
* Renal: Increased serum creatinine levels.
* Respiratory: Cough, dyspnea, and upper respiratory tract infections.
* Other: Fever.

Less common but serious side effects include seizures, psychotic reactions, bronchitis, pneumonia, respiratory failure, atrioventricular block, interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis.

**It is crucial to report any side effects to your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works
Lorlatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by selectively blocking the activity of the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) enzyme, which is often abnormally active in ALK-positive NSCLC.  By inhibiting ALK, Lorlatinib prevents the cancer cells from growing and spreading.  The drug also targets other kinases, such as ROS1,  further contributing to its anti-cancer effects.  Its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier is notable.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Lorlatinib is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components and in those concurrently using strong CYP3A inducers.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Lorlatinib's metabolism is significantly affected by CYP3A enzymes.  Co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers can decrease Lorlatinib's effectiveness, while strong CYP3A inhibitors can increase its levels and side effects.  Careful monitoring and dose adjustments may be necessary. Avoid co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and fluconazole.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Lorlatinib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment and for at least six months afterward.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for seven days after the last dose.
* **Other Precautions:**  Monitor for potential side effects, particularly those affecting the nervous system, heart, liver, and lungs.  Regular blood tests and monitoring of blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels are often necessary.  Elderly patients may require closer monitoring due to an increased risk of adverse reactions.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Lorlatinib with food?** A: Lorlatinib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose unless it's within 4 hours of your next scheduled dose. Don't double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Lorlatinib?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided with your medication.

* **Q: Is Lorlatinib right for me?** A: Only a healthcare professional can determine if Lorlatinib is appropriate for your specific situation. Your doctor will consider your medical history, tumor type and characteristics, and other factors.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any side effects to your doctor immediately.  They will help you manage them appropriately.  Don't stop taking the medication without consulting your doctor first.
