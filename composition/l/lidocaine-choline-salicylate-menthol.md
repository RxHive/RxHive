# Lidocaine + Choline Salicylate + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Lidocaine + Choline Salicylate + Menthol (This is a combination product, so there isn't one single generic name encompassing all variations.  Different manufacturers may have slight variations in formulation.)


**Usage:** Topical analgesic for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains associated with:

* Muscle aches
* Arthritis pain
* Backache
* Sprains
* Bruises
* Minor burns
* Sunburn (after the initial burn has subsided)
* Insect bites and stings


**Side Effects:**  Generally well-tolerated but may include:

* **Local skin reactions:**  Burning, stinging, redness, itching, rash, swelling at the application site. These are usually mild and temporary.
* **Allergic reactions (rare):**  Hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* **Systemic effects (unlikely with topical use):**  Though rare with topical application, high doses or absorption through broken skin could theoretically lead to systemic effects like dizziness, drowsiness, nervousness, and cardiovascular changes. This is much more likely with injections or ingestion.


**How it Works:**

* **Lidocaine:** A local anesthetic that numbs the skin by blocking nerve signals that transmit pain.
* **Choline Salicylate:** A salicylate, related to aspirin, which has anti-inflammatory and mild analgesic properties.  It reduces inflammation and pain at the site of application.
* **Menthol:** A counterirritant that creates a cooling sensation on the skin, which can distract from pain and provide a mild analgesic effect.  The cooling sensation also has a mild numbing effect.

The combination of these three ingredients provides a multifaceted approach to pain relief: numbing, anti-inflammation, and counterirritation.
