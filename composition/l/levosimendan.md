# Levosimendan
### Generic Name
Levosimendan

### Usage
Levosimendan is primarily used for the short-term treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in adults.  This is a situation where the heart isn't pumping effectively enough to meet the body's needs, and standard treatments haven't provided sufficient improvement.  It's used when other therapies are inadequate, and inotropic support (medication to strengthen the heart's contractions) is deemed necessary. Levosimendan is administered intravenously (IV) for this purpose.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Acute Decompensated Heart Failure):**

* **Initial Dose:** 6-12 mcg/kg infused intravenously over 10 minutes.  If given alongside other IV vasodilators or inotropes, the initial dose should be reduced to 6 mcg/kg over 10 minutes.
* **Maintenance Dose:** 0.1 mcg/kg/min by continuous IV infusion.  If significant hypotension (low blood pressure) or tachycardia (rapid heart rate) develop, the infusion rate should be reduced to 0.05 mcg/kg/min or stopped entirely.  If the response is insufficient, the rate may be increased to a maximum of 0.2 mcg/kg/min.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of levosimendan in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is specifically recommended for mild to moderate impairment; however, careful monitoring is crucial.  Levosimendan is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  While the manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for creatinine clearance (CrCl) â‰¥ 30 mL/min, caution is advised.  Levosimendan is contraindicated in patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Ventricular tachycardia (a rapid heart rhythm originating in the ventricles)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat)
* Cardiac failure worsening
* Various extrasystoles (premature heartbeats)
* Myocardial ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart muscle)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Decreased hemoglobin levels (anemia)


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Ventricular fibrillation (a life-threatening irregular heartbeat)


**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Levosimendan works by sensitizing the heart muscle cells to calcium.  This increased sensitivity to calcium leads to stronger heart contractions, improving the heart's pumping ability.  Additionally, it causes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing blood pressure and the workload on the heart.  It's believed that levosimendan also provides some cardioprotective effects by opening certain channels within the heart's mitochondria.  The overall result is increased cardiac output, stroke volume, and ejection fraction (the amount of blood pumped with each heartbeat), along with reduced pressure in the pulmonary and circulatory systems.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to levosimendan or any component of the formulation.
* Significant mechanical obstruction of ventricular filling or outflow.
* Severe hypotension and tachycardia.
* Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min).
* Severe hepatic impairment.
* History of torsades de pointes (a type of irregular heartbeat).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of anemia, cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), hypokalemia, and hypotension.
* Use with caution in patients with concurrent anemia and ischemic heart disease, pre-existing tachycardia, low baseline blood pressure (especially those taking IV vasodilators or inotropes), mild-to-moderate hepatic or renal impairment, ongoing myocardial ischemia, QTc prolongation, or those taking QTc-prolonging medications.


### FAQs

**Q: How is levosimendan administered?**
A: Levosimendan is administered intravenously (IV).

**Q: How long is the treatment course?**
A: Levosimendan is intended for short-term treatment of acute decompensated heart failure. The duration depends on individual patient response and clinical condition.

**Q: Does levosimendan have any drug interactions?**
A: Yes, levosimendan can interact with various medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

**Q: How should levosimendan be stored?**
A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label.  Generally, medications should be kept in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: Is levosimendan safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?**
A: While it can be used in pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the risks and an inotropic is needed, breastfeeding is not recommended.
