# Levosalbutamol + Ambroxol
### Generic Name
Levosalbutamol + Ambroxol


### Usage

Levosalbutamol + Ambroxol is a combination medication used to treat symptoms of respiratory tract infections, particularly those causing cough and wheezing.  It combines the bronchodilator effects of levosalbutamol with the expectorant properties of ambroxol.

Levosalbutamol, a beta-2 agonist, relaxes the muscles in the airways, making breathing easier by widening the bronchial passages. This helps alleviate wheezing and shortness of breath. Ambroxol, a mucolytic agent, thins and loosens mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up and clear. This helps relieve congestion and coughing.

The combination is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of acute and chronic bronchitis, and other respiratory conditions where both bronchodilation and mucus thinning are beneficial. It's frequently prescribed for conditions associated with excessive mucus production and airway narrowing.  Note that this combination does not treat the underlying infection itself; it only manages the symptoms.


### Dosage

Dosage will vary depending on the specific formulation (e.g., syrup, tablets), the age and weight of the patient, and the severity of the condition.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  **Do not exceed the recommended dosage.**

**Adults (Oral):**  Dosage instructions vary widely depending on the product, so refer to the specific packaging for your medication. Generally, this combination is not recommended for long-term use without ongoing medical supervision.

**Children (Oral):** Dosage for children is strictly dependent on age and weight and should only be determined by a pediatrician.  There are different formulations specifically designed for children with age-appropriate dosages.

**IV Administration:** This combination medication is not typically administered intravenously. Levosalbutamol and ambroxol are usually delivered orally.  Intravenous administration of either drug would be done separately under strict medical supervision.

**Important Note:**  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting any medication, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Tremors
* Headache

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) â€“ characterized by swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, difficulty breathing, and hives.
* Irregular heartbeat
* High blood pressure
* Seizures
* Severe stomach upset

If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works

Levosalbutamol works by binding to beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the smooth muscles of the airways. This activation leads to relaxation of the airway muscles, resulting in bronchodilation (widening of the airways).  This improved airflow eases breathing and reduces wheezing.

Ambroxol increases the secretion of fluid in the lungs and alters the properties of mucus, making it less viscous (thicker). This thinning effect makes it easier to expel mucus through coughing, helping to clear the airways of congestion.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity to levosalbutamol, ambroxol, or any of the inactive ingredients.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  Certain medications may interact with levosalbutamol or ambroxol.
