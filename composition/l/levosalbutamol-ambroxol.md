# Levosalbutamol + Ambroxol

**Generic Name:** Levosalbutamol + Ambroxol

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat symptoms of respiratory tract infections, particularly those causing bronchospasm (constriction of the airways) and excess mucus.  It's commonly used for conditions like bronchitis and other obstructive pulmonary diseases.  Levosalbutamol, a beta-2 agonist, relaxes the muscles around the airways, making breathing easier. Ambroxol, a mucolytic agent, thins and loosens mucus, making it easier to cough up.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects can include:

* **From Levosalbutamol:** Tremors, headache, nervousness, palpitations, muscle cramps, increased heart rate, dizziness.  Rarely, more serious side effects such as serious heart rhythm problems can occur.
* **From Ambroxol:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, dry mouth.  Rarely, allergic reactions such as skin rash or itching may occur.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list, and more serious side effects are possible.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Levosalbutamol:**  It works by binding to beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs. This triggers a cascade of events leading to relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscles, resulting in bronchodilation (widening of the airways).
* **Ambroxol:** It increases the production of surfactant (a substance that keeps the alveoli, or air sacs in the lungs, from collapsing) and reduces the viscosity of mucus, making it easier to expel through coughing.  It also increases the activity of cilia (hair-like structures in the airways that help clear mucus).  The combined effect is improved clearance of mucus from the airways.
