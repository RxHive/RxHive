# Lidocaine + Calcium Dobesilate + Hydrocortisone + Phenylephrine + Zinc Oxide + Troxerutin

It's important to preface this by stating that there is **no standard, commercially available combination drug containing Lidocaine + Calcium Dobesilate + Hydrocortisone + Phenylephrine + Zinc Oxide + Troxerutin.**  This combination would likely be a compounded medication, mixed by a pharmacist based on a doctor's prescription for a very specific patient need.  Therefore, information below should be considered as general information about the *individual* ingredients and their *potential* combined effects, not specific details about a pre-existing formulation.  **Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before using any compounded medication.**

**Generic Name:**  This would not have a single generic name as it's not a pre-existing combination drug. The names are listed individually above.


**Usage:** A compounded cream or ointment containing this combination of ingredients might be prescribed for the topical treatment of conditions involving inflammation, pain, and venous insufficiency, potentially in a localized area.  Each ingredient contributes differently:

* **Lidocaine:** Local anesthetic to relieve pain.
* **Calcium Dobesilate:**  Used to improve microcirculation and reduce inflammation in venous disorders.
* **Hydrocortisone:** Corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and itching.
* **Phenylephrine:** Vasoconstrictor to reduce swelling and congestion.  Use in topical formulations is less common than oral or nasal applications.
* **Zinc Oxide:**  Astringent and protectant; may help soothe irritated skin.
* **Troxerutin:** Bioflavonoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, often used to treat venous insufficiency.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects would depend on the concentration of each ingredient and the individual's sensitivity. Potential side effects could include:

* **Lidocaine:** Allergic reactions (rare but possible), burning or stinging sensation at the application site.
* **Calcium Dobesilate:** Relatively few side effects reported, but gastrointestinal upset is possible.
* **Hydrocortisone:** Skin thinning, skin discoloration, increased risk of infection with prolonged use.
* **Phenylephrine:** Increased blood pressure (less likely topically), nervousness, headache.
* **Zinc Oxide:** Rarely causes irritation, but prolonged use may lead to dryness.
* **Troxerutin:**  Generally well-tolerated but mild gastrointestinal upset may occur.

* **Pain relief:** Lidocaine.
* **Inflammation reduction:** Hydrocortisone, Calcium Dobesilate, Troxerutin.
* **Improved circulation:** Calcium Dobesilate, Troxerutin (indirectly).
