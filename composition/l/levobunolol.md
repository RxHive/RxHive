# Levobunolol
### Generic Name
Levobunolol

### Usage
Levobunolol is primarily used to treat elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in individuals with ocular hypertension or chronic open-angle glaucoma.  These conditions affect the eye's ability to drain fluid, leading to increased pressure that can damage the optic nerve and ultimately impair vision.  Levobunolol helps lower this pressure, thereby protecting vision.  It's important to note that levobunolol does *not* treat angle-closure glaucoma.

### Dosage
Dosage instructions vary depending on the concentration of the levobunolol solution and the severity of the condition.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

* **Elevated Intraocular Pressure (Ocular Hypertension or Chronic Open-Angle Glaucoma):**

    * **0.25% Solution:** Typically, 1-2 drops are instilled into the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID).
    * **0.5% Solution:**  Usually, 1-2 drops are instilled into the affected eye(s) once daily (OD).  In cases of severe or uncontrolled glaucoma, the dosage may be increased to 1 drop twice daily (BID).


* **Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of levobunolol in children have not been established.


**Administration:**  When administering levobunolol eye drops, it's crucial to:

* Wash your hands thoroughly before applying the drops.
* Remove contact lenses before application and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.
* Gently pull down your lower eyelid to create a pouch and instill the drops into the pouch.
* Avoid touching the dropper tip to your eye or any other surface to prevent contamination.
* Gently close your eye for about a minute after application to help the medication absorb properly.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of users) can include burning and stinging sensations in the eyes.

Less common, but still possible side effects (affecting 1-10% or less of users) can include:

* **Ophthalmic:** Blepharoconjunctivitis (inflammation of the eyelids and conjunctiva), blepharoptosis (drooping eyelids), decreased corneal sensitivity, diplopia (double vision), iridocyclitis (inflammation of the iris and ciliary body), keratitis (inflammation of the cornea), ocular allergy, visual disturbances.
* **Nervous System:** Ataxia (lack of coordination), confusion, depression, dizziness, exacerbation of myasthenia gravis (a neuromuscular disorder), headache, lethargy, paresthesia (numbness or tingling).
* **Cardiovascular:** Bradycardia (slow heart rate), cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), cardiac failure, cerebral ischemia (reduced blood flow to the brain), cerebrovascular accident (stroke), chest pain, heart block, hypotension (low blood pressure), palpitations, syncope (fainting).
* **Dermatologic:** Alopecia (hair loss), pruritus (itching), skin rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction), urticaria (hives).
* **Endocrine and Metabolic:** Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) - particularly important for those with diabetes.  The drug may mask symptoms of low blood sugar.
* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea, nausea.
* **Genitourinary:** Impotence.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Allergic reactions.
* **Neuromuscular and Skeletal:** Weakness.
* **Respiratory:** Bronchospasm (constriction of the airways), dyspnea (shortness of breath), nasal congestion, respiratory failure.

If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Levobunolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker.  It works by reducing the production of aqueous humor (the fluid within the eye) and possibly increasing its outflow. This dual mechanism lowers IOP and relieves the pressure on the optic nerve.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Levobunolol is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to levobunolol or other beta-blockers, bronchial asthma or a history of it, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, sinus bradycardia, cardiogenic shock, or overt heart failure.

* **Drug Interactions:** Levobunolol can interact with numerous medications, including other antihypertensives, calcium channel blockers, cardiac glycosides, and more.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Specific Populations:**
    * **Pregnant Women:** Levobunolol is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the risk to the fetus is not fully known. Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Punctal occlusion (closing the tear ducts) may help reduce fetal exposure.
    * **Breastfeeding Mothers:**  It's unknown whether levobunolol is excreted in breast milk.  Use should be approached with caution.
    * **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, particularly cardiovascular ones.  Careful monitoring is advised.

* **Other Precautions:** Levobunolol can mask signs of hyperthyroidism.  Patients with diabetes should monitor their blood sugar closely as levobunolol can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia.  Sudden cessation of therapy should be avoided.  The medication contains metabisulfite, which may cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for levobunolol to work?** A: The effect on IOP typically begins within about 60 minutes after administration, with maximum effect generally seen within 12 hours.

* **Q: Can I use levobunolol with other eye drops?** A: Consult your doctor.  Avoid using multiple ophthalmic beta-blockers simultaneously, and allow at least 15 minutes between applying different eye drops.

* **Q: How should I store levobunolol?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can levobunolol cause blurred vision?** A: Yes, blurred vision is a possible side effect.  If this occurs, avoid driving or operating machinery until vision clears.
