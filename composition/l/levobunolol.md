# Levobunolol

**Generic Name:** Levobunolol

**Usage:**

Levobunolol is a beta-blocker used primarily to treat:

* **Ocular Hypertension:**  Increased pressure inside the eye, a major risk factor for glaucoma. It lowers intraocular pressure (IOP).
* **Glaucoma (open-angle):** A condition causing damage to the optic nerve, often due to increased IOP.  It helps to manage and control IOP.


**Side Effects:**

Levobunolol, like other beta-blockers, can cause a range of side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  These can include:

* **Eye-related:** Burning, stinging, or itching in the eye; blurred vision; dry eyes; eye discharge; eyelid irritation.
* **Systemic (affecting the whole body):** These are less common but can be serious.  They include:
    * Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
    * Hypotension (low blood pressure)
    * Bronchospasm (wheezing, difficulty breathing â€“ particularly problematic for those with asthma or COPD)
    * Dizziness or lightheadedness
    * Fatigue
    * Nausea
    * Depression
    * Sleep disturbances
    * Cold hands and feet


**How it Works:**

Levobunolol works by blocking the effects of beta-adrenergic receptors in the eye. This action reduces the production of aqueous humor (the fluid that fills the eye), leading to a decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP).  Lowering IOP helps protect the optic nerve from damage.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I use levobunolol if I have asthma or COPD?** A:  Generally, no.  Beta-blockers can worsen breathing problems in people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Discuss this with your doctor before using levobunolol.
* **Q: Can I drive after using levobunolol?** A:  Blurred vision is a possible side effect.  Wait to see if this affects your vision before driving.
* **Q: How often should I use levobunolol?** A: Your doctor will determine the appropriate dosage and frequency, typically once or twice daily.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I use levobunolol with other eye drops?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist.  There may be interactions with other medications.  Allow sufficient time between applying different eye drops.
* **Q: What are the signs of an allergic reaction?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or a fast, irregular heartbeat.
