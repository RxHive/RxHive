# Lesinurad
### Generic Name
Lesinurad

### Usage
Lesinurad is an antigout medication used to lower uric acid levels in the blood.  It's specifically indicated for patients with hyperuricemia (high uric acid) associated with gout who haven't reached their target uric acid levels with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (like allopurinol or febuxostat) alone.  Lesinurad is *not* used as a standalone treatment; it's always given in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.  It is not recommended for treating asymptomatic hyperuricemia (high uric acid without gout symptoms).

### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical dose is 200 mg once daily, taken orally, in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.  This 200 mg dose should not be exceeded.  If treatment with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor is stopped, Lesinurad should also be stopped.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Lesinurad in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate liver impairment.  Lesinurad is not recommended for patients with severe liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Careful monitoring is essential. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of â‰¥ 60 mL/min. For CrCl 45 to <60 mL/min, close monitoring is required.  Lesinurad should not be initiated if CrCl is 35 to <45 mL/min.  Lesinurad is contraindicated in patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min, those with end-stage renal disease, or those on dialysis. If renal function declines to CrCl <45 mL/min during treatment, Lesinurad must be discontinued.

### Side Effects
**Common (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
* Influenza (flu)
* Increased serum creatinine levels (a sign of potential kidney problems)

**Less Common but Serious:**

* Renal failure (acute or chronic)
* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Cerebrovascular accident (stroke)
* Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)

If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Lesinurad works by inhibiting two proteins in the kidneys: uric acid transporter 1 (URAT1) and organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4). These proteins are involved in reabsorbing uric acid back into the bloodstream. By blocking these transporters, Lesinurad increases the amount of uric acid excreted in the urine, thus lowering uric acid levels in the blood.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Lesinurad is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min), end-stage renal disease, those on dialysis, kidney transplant recipients, tumor lysis syndrome, and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

**Warnings:** There's an increased risk of nephrotoxicity (kidney damage), gout flares, and cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, death) with Lesinurad.  It should only be used in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor and not as monotherapy. It should be added only if the target uric acid level is not achieved with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor alone.  Use with caution in patients who are poor metabolizers of CYP2C9.

**Drug Interactions:** Lesinurad can interact with many medications, affecting their levels or effectiveness in the body.  Examples include clozapine, certain estrogen and progestin derivatives, nimodipine, selpercatinib, tacrolimus, ubrogepant, alpelisib, aspirin, rifapentine, and others.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Lesinurad alone?** A: No, Lesinurad must be taken in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. It is not effective as a monotherapy.

* **Q: How should I take Lesinurad?** A: Take it orally, once daily in the morning, with food and water, at the same time as your xanthine oxidase inhibitor.

* **Q: How long will it take to work?** A: The time it takes to lower uric acid levels varies, but regular monitoring is crucial.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Lesinurad?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
