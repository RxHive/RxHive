# Letrozole
### Generic Name
Letrozole

### Usage
Letrozole is primarily used to treat breast cancer in postmenopausal women.  Its main applications include:

* **Adjuvant treatment for hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer:** This means Letrozole is given after surgery or other primary treatments to help prevent the cancer from returning.
* **Extended adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer:**  Following five years of tamoxifen therapy, Letrozole can be used for further cancer prevention.
* **Treatment of advanced breast cancer:** Letrozole is used when breast cancer has progressed despite prior treatment with anti-estrogen medications.
* **First-line treatment for hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor status unknown, locally advanced, or metastatic breast cancer:**  In some cases, Letrozole is the initial treatment chosen for certain types of advanced breast cancer.


It's important to note that Letrozole is also used off-label for other conditions, including ovulation stimulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer.  However, these uses are not officially approved by regulatory agencies and should only be considered under the strict guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

Letrozole is typically administered orally as a tablet.  Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's characteristics.  Always follow the prescription instructions provided by your doctor.  Here are some examples:

* **Advanced breast cancer (postmenopausal women):** The usual dose is 2.5 mg once daily until disease progression.
* **Early breast cancer (postmenopausal women, adjuvant/extended adjuvant):**  The usual dose is 2.5 mg once daily for a planned duration of 5 years. Treatment is discontinued if the cancer returns.
* **Ovulation stimulation (off-label, PCOS):**  The initial dose is typically 2.5 mg once daily for 5 days, starting on day 3, 4, or 5 of the menstrual cycle.  The dosage may be increased under medical supervision.
* **Other off-label uses:** Dosage for other off-label indications is determined on a case-by-case basis by a physician.


Dosage adjustments might be necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.  Individuals with severe hepatic impairment may require a reduced dose.  Renal (kidney) impairment usually does not require dosage adjustment.  Pediatric use of Letrozole is contraindicated (not permitted).

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Hot flashes
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Muscle pain (myalgia)
* Swelling (edema)
* Increased cholesterol levels

Less common but potentially serious side effects can include:

* Blood clots (thromboembolism)
* Stroke
* Heart attack
* Osteoporosis (weakening of bones)
* Liver damage

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor.  Aromatase is an enzyme that converts male hormones (androgens) into female hormones (estrogens).  Many breast cancers rely on estrogen for growth.  By blocking aromatase, Letrozole significantly reduces estrogen levels in the body, thereby hindering the growth of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Letrozole is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it poses a significant risk to the developing fetus. It is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  A pregnancy test is typically required before starting Letrozole treatment.
* **Liver and kidney function:**  Patients with impaired liver function may require dosage adjustments.  Those with impaired kidney function generally do not.
* **Bone health:**  Letrozole can decrease bone mineral density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.  Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is often recommended.
* **Cholesterol levels:** Letrozole can increase cholesterol levels; monitoring is recommended.
* **Interactions with other drugs:** Letrozole may interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  Tamoxifen, for example, may interact negatively with Letrozole.


### FAQs

* **Can I take Letrozole with food?**  Letrozole can usually be taken with or without food.
* **How should I store Letrozole?** Store Letrozole at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Can I stop taking Letrozole if I feel better?** No, do not stop taking Letrozole without consulting your doctor.  Stopping treatment prematurely could negatively impact the treatment outcome.
* **Is Letrozole safe for everyone?** No, Letrozole is contraindicated for pregnant or breastfeeding women and children.  Patients with certain medical conditions may also require special considerations.
