# Lithium
### Generic Name
Lithium

### Usage

Lithium is primarily used as a mood stabilizer in the treatment of bipolar disorder.  Its main application is in managing manic and mixed episodes (periods of intense mood swings characterized by elevated mood and energy, sometimes accompanied by irritability or agitation).  It's also crucial for preventing future episodes of mania and depression in individuals with bipolar I disorder.  While not a first-line treatment, lithium is sometimes used as an adjunctive therapy (in addition to other medications) for major depressive disorder, though this is considered off-label use.

### Dosage

Lithium dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's age, weight, kidney function, and response to treatment.  Serum lithium levels are closely monitored to ensure the medication is effective while minimizing the risk of toxicity.  Dosages are usually titrated upward slowly under the careful supervision of a healthcare professional.

**Adults:**

* **Acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes (monotherapy):** Initial doses typically start around 300 mg three times daily (TID), gradually increased every 3 days until the desired serum lithium level (0.8-1.2 mEq/L) is reached.  The maintenance dose is usually lower (0.8-1.0 mEq/L).  Extended-release formulations may allow for less frequent dosing.

* **Maintenance therapy:** Once stable, the dosage is adjusted to maintain the therapeutic serum lithium level.

**Children and Adolescents (7-17 years):**

Dosage is based on weight and age.  Lower starting doses are used, with careful titration and frequent monitoring. Extended-release formulations are generally not recommended for younger children.  Use in children under 12 is generally not recommended unless there is serious need, with close medical monitoring being crucial.

**Dosage Forms:** Lithium is available in immediate-release tablets or capsules, extended-release tablets, and oral solutions.  Extended-release formulations should be swallowed whole; they should not be crushed or chewed.

**Important Note:**  All lithium dosage adjustments should be made under the direct supervision of a physician.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Tremors (shaking)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Weight gain
* Increased thirst and urination (polyuria)
* Fatigue

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Kidney problems (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus)
* Thyroid problems (hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism)
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Lithium toxicity (see Precautions)

**Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

The exact mechanism of lithium's mood-stabilizing effect isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to influence several neurotransmitter systems in the brain.  It may affect the activity of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate, contributing to its ability to stabilize mood and reduce the severity of manic and depressive episodes. It might also interact with cellular processes that influence nerve signaling and neurotransmission.

### Precautions

* **Kidney disease:** Lithium is primarily excreted by the kidneys.  Individuals with kidney impairment require careful monitoring and potentially lower doses due to increased risk of toxicity.
* **Heart disease:**  Lithium can affect heart rhythm in some individuals; therefore, cardiac monitoring may be necessary.
* **Thyroid disease:** Lithium can affect thyroid function; regular thyroid function tests are recommended during treatment.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Lithium is categorized as a pregnancy Category D drug (it poses a risk to the fetus), and breastfeeding is generally discouraged during lithium treatment because it crosses the placenta and is secreted into breast milk. Careful assessment of the risks and benefits is necessary if treatment is continued during pregnancy.
* **Dehydration and low sodium levels:**  Dehydration and low sodium levels can increase the risk of lithium toxicity.  Maintaining adequate fluid and salt intake is crucial.
* **Drug Interactions:** Many medications interact with lithium.  It's essential to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking. Some interactions can significantly increase lithium levels and risk toxicity.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking lithium suddenly?**  A: No. Abruptly stopping lithium can lead to a recurrence of symptoms and potentially serious withdrawal effects.  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: How often do I need blood tests while on lithium?** A:  The frequency of blood tests depends on your individual situation and is determined by your doctor.  They are typically done more often initially to monitor lithium levels and adjust the dose appropriately.  Once stable, tests might be less frequent.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of lithium?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking lithium?** A:  No. Alcohol can interact with lithium and increase the risk of side effects.  Avoid alcohol consumption while on lithium.

* **Q: What are the signs of lithium toxicity?** A:  Symptoms of lithium toxicity include severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, confusion, and seizures.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
