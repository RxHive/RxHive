# Lactobacillus Delbrueckii
### Generic Name
Lactobacillus Delbrueckii

### Usage

*Lactobacillus delbrueckii* is a probiotic bacterium primarily used to support gut health.  While it's found naturally in fermented dairy products,  its use as a therapeutic probiotic is relatively specific. Currently, research suggests its potential benefit in treating Behçet's disease, a rare inflammatory disorder. More research is needed to fully establish its efficacy and determine its potential role in treating other conditions.  It's important to note that *Lactobacillus delbrueckii* is not a treatment for all gastrointestinal issues and its application should be under medical supervision.


### Dosage

Dosage recommendations for *Lactobacillus delbrueckii* vary significantly depending on the specific product formulation (capsules, tablets, or as part of a fermented food), the targeted condition, and the patient's individual needs.  There isn't a standardized dosage across all applications.  Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional or the product label.  Self-medicating with probiotics should be avoided.   For children, consult a pediatrician before administering any probiotic supplements.


### Side Effects

Common side effects, though generally mild, can include:

* Bloating
* Flatulence (gas)

Serious side effects are rare but can occur, particularly in individuals with compromised immune systems.  If you experience any unusual symptoms after taking *Lactobacillus delbrueckii*, seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works

*Lactobacillus delbrueckii*, as a probiotic, works by re-establishing a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut. This helps suppress the growth of harmful bacteria and improves overall gut flora.  It achieves this through several mechanisms including the production of lactic acid, which creates an environment that discourages the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. It may also stimulate local immunity and promote water reabsorption in the intestines.  The precise mechanisms by which it might affect conditions like Behçet's disease are still under investigation.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Individuals with known hypersensitivity to *Lactobacillus delbrueckii* or related components should avoid its use.

* **Immunocompromised Patients:**  Probiotics, including *Lactobacillus delbrueckii*, should be used with caution in immunocompromised individuals (those with weakened immune systems) as they may pose a risk of infection.

* **Gastrointestinal Perforation:**  Avoid using this probiotic if you have a gastrointestinal perforation (a hole in the digestive tract).

* **Milk Protein Sensitivity:**  Individuals sensitive to milk protein should exercise caution as some formulations may contain milk derivatives.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Currently, there's insufficient data to determine the safety of *Lactobacillus delbrueckii* during pregnancy or lactation.  Consult your doctor before using it during these periods.
