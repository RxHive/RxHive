### Usage
Luvistin is primarily an antihistamine used to treat allergic reactions. It helps alleviate symptoms associated with allergies.  In combination with calcium lactate or gluconate, it's also used in the treatment of osteoporosis.

Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.**  The dosage will vary significantly depending on the specific condition being treated (allergic reaction vs. osteoporosis, if applicable), the patient's age, weight, and overall health.
