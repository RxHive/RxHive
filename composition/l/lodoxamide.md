# Lodoxamide
### Generic Name
Lodoxamide

### Usage
Lodoxamide is a mast-cell stabilizer primarily used to treat allergic eye conditions.  Its main applications are in managing vernal keratoconjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, and vernal keratitis. These are all inflammatory conditions affecting the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the eyelid and covering the white part of the eye) and sometimes the cornea (the clear front part of the eye).  The inflammation is caused by an allergic reaction. Lodoxamide helps to reduce the symptoms associated with these conditions.


### Dosage

**Topical Administration (Eye Drops):** Lodoxamide is administered as eye drops. The typical dosage is 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) four times a day (QID). Treatment duration is usually up to 3 months.

**Adults and Children >2 years:** The dosage is the same for both adults and children over the age of 2,  1-2 drops in the affected eye four times a day for a maximum of 3 months.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However,  adjustments are generally considered unnecessary because of the medication's low systemic absorption (meaning it doesn't significantly enter the bloodstream).


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting more than 10% of patients):**

* Transient local burning, stinging, and discomfort.

**Less Common Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Eye warming sensation
* Eye fatigue
* Chemosis (swelling of the conjunctiva)
* Corneal abrasion (scratch on the cornea)

If any of these side effects occur or worsen, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Lodoxamide is a mast-cell stabilizer. Mast cells are immune cells that release histamine and other substances that trigger allergic reactions.  By stabilizing mast cells, lodoxamide prevents the release of these substances, reducing the inflammation and allergic symptoms in the eye.  It specifically inhibits the immediate hypersensitivity reaction (type I) associated with IgE and antigen-mediated reactionsâ€”the type of allergic reaction that contributes to vernal keratoconjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, and vernal keratitis.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Lodoxamide is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to lodoxamide or any components of the formulation.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Increased Risk of Irritation:**  Some patients may experience increased eye irritation.
* **Visual Disturbances:** Temporary blurred vision is possible; patients should avoid activities requiring sharp vision, such as driving or operating machinery, until their vision clears.
* **Contact Lenses:** Contact lenses should be removed before instillation and reinserted 15 minutes afterward.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Lodoxamide is categorized as Pregnancy Category B.  While studies haven't shown harm to the fetus, use during pregnancy should be carefully considered.  The excretion of lodoxamide in breast milk is unknown; therefore, use during breastfeeding should be approached cautiously.
