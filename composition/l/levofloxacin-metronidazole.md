# Levofloxacin + Metronidazole
### Generic Name
Levofloxacin + Metronidazole Combination

**Note:**  Levofloxacin and Metronidazole are typically prescribed as separate medications, not always as a pre-mixed combination.  A doctor might prescribe them together for specific infections where their combined action is beneficial. This information reflects the combined effects and considerations of using both medications concurrently.  It's crucial to follow your doctor's specific instructions and dosage.


### Usage

This combination of antibiotics is primarily used to treat severe bacterial infections where both a fluoroquinolone (Levofloxacin) and a nitroimidazole (Metronidazole) are needed.  Common uses include:

* **Intra-abdominal infections:** Infections within the abdominal cavity, often involving multiple bacteria.  These may result from conditions like appendicitis, diverticulitis, or peritonitis.
* **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID):** A serious infection of the female reproductive organs.
* **Infections of the gynecological tract:**  Including some bacterial vaginosis cases (though Metronidazole alone is often sufficient).
* **Other severe infections:** In cases where a broader spectrum of antibiotic coverage is required,  your doctor might prescribe this combination for other serious bacterial infections.


### Dosage

**Dosage is highly variable and must be determined by a physician based on the specific infection, the patient's health, and other factors.** There is no standard pre-mixed combination product. The physician will prescribe the appropriate dose of each drug separately.  

* **Levofloxacin:** Dosage varies depending on the infection being treated, ranging from 250mg to 750mg once or twice daily.  It can be administered orally or intravenously (IV).  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with kidney problems.
* **Metronidazole:** Dosage also depends on the infection, usually ranging from 500mg to 750mg twice daily. It can be administered orally or intravenously (IV).  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with liver problems.

**Children:**  The use of both Levofloxacin and Metronidazole is generally avoided in children unless absolutely necessary due to potential side effects.  Dosage and appropriateness will be determined by a physician based on the severity of the infection and the child's age and weight.  

**IV Administration:**  IV administration of both drugs is typically done in a hospital setting under medical supervision. The specific dosage and infusion rate will be determined by a physician.

### How it Works

* **Levofloxacin:** This fluoroquinolone antibiotic works by inhibiting bacterial enzymes (DNA gyrases and topoisomerases) that are essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair.  This leads to bacterial cell death.

* **Metronidazole:** This nitroimidazole antibiotic disrupts bacterial DNA synthesis by interfering with DNA structure.  It is particularly effective against anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that thrive in oxygen-poor environments) and some protozoa.


The combined use of Levofloxacin and Metronidazole provides broader coverage against a wider range of bacterial species, making it effective for treating polymicrobial infections (infections involving more than one type of bacteria).


### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Do not take either drug if you have a known allergy to fluoroquinolones (Levofloxacin) or nitroimidazoles (Metronidazole).

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use of Levofloxacin and Metronidazole during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only used if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Consult your doctor.

* **Kidney and Liver Disease:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with kidney or liver impairment.

* **Drug Interactions:** Both Levofloxacin and Metronidazole can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Photosensitivity:** Levofloxacin can increase sensitivity to sunlight. Protect your skin from excessive sun exposure.

* **Alcohol Consumption:** Avoid alcohol while taking Metronidazole as it can cause a disulfiram-like reaction (nausea, vomiting, headache).

* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be at increased risk of side effects from both drugs. Careful monitoring is necessary.
