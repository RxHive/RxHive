# Lactic Acid
### Generic Name
Lactic Acid

### Usage
Lactic acid is primarily used topically as a moisturizer and lubricant for the skin. Its main application is to alleviate dryness and itching associated with various skin conditions. While not a treatment for the underlying condition, it helps to improve the skin's hydration and reduce discomfort.


### Dosage
**Dryness and/or Itching (Topical Application):**

* **Adults and Children:**  A 10% lactic acid lotion is typically applied to the affected area twice daily (BID).

**Important Considerations:**  The provided dosage information is general; specific instructions may vary depending on the product formulation and the severity of the condition. Always follow the directions on the product label or as advised by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Burning sensation
* Mild stinging
* Peeling skin

Less common but potentially more serious side effects are not well documented for topical lactic acid application at typical concentrations.  However, any unusual skin reaction, persistent irritation, or worsening of symptoms warrants immediate consultation with a doctor.


### How it Works
Lactic acid works by increasing the skin's moisture content. It achieves this by softening and dissolving keratin, a protein that holds the top layer of skin cells together. By breaking down keratin, lactic acid allows better penetration of moisturizers and improves skin hydration, leading to reduced dryness and itching.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Lactic acid should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to lactic acid or any other components of the formulation.
* **Photosensitivity:**  Minimize exposure of treated skin areas to sunlight, as there's a potential increased risk of photosensitivity.
* **Skin Irritation:**  If significant irritation develops, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.
* **External Use Only:** Lactic acid is for external use only. Avoid contact with eyes, lips, and mucous membranes.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Topical use of lactic acid during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally considered safe due to limited dermal penetration. However, it's advisable to consult a doctor for personalized advice.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use lactic acid on my face?** A: While generally safe for topical use, it's best to test a small area first to check for any adverse reactions.  Avoid contact with the eyes.
* **Q: How should I store lactic acid lotion?** A: Store according to the product label instructions, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat.

* **Q: Is lactic acid a cure for dry skin?** A: No, lactic acid is a moisturizer that helps alleviate dryness and itching symptoms. It doesn't address the underlying cause of dry skin.
* **Q: Can I use lactic acid with other skincare products?** A: Itâ€™s advisable to use it with caution, perhaps introducing it gradually into your routine and monitoring for any adverse reactions.  If you have concerns, consult your doctor or dermatologist.
