# Levosalbutamol + Ipratropium

**Generic Name:** Levosalbutamol + Ipratropium bromide

**Usage:**

Levosalbutamol + Ipratropium bromide is a combination medication used to prevent and treat bronchospasm in people with reversible obstructive airway disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's often used for quick relief of symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.  It's usually administered via an inhaler.  The medication is *not* for the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Tremors (shaking)
* Headache
* Nausea
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Throat irritation
* Muscle cramps
* Increased heart rate (tachycardia)
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulty - this is rare but serious)


Less common, but potentially more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)
* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias)
* High blood pressure
* Seizures


**How it Works:**

This combination inhaler contains two active ingredients:

* **Levosalbutamol (a beta2-agonist):**  It relaxes the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe. It works quickly to relieve symptoms.
* **Ipratropium bromide (an anticholinergic):** It also helps to relax the muscles in the airways, but it works through a different mechanism than levosalbutamol.  This dual action provides a more comprehensive bronchodilating effect.

Together, these two medications provide faster and more effective relief from bronchospasm than either medication alone.
