# Lithium carbonate

**Generic Name:** Lithium Carbonate

**Usage:**

Lithium carbonate is primarily used to treat the manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder (also known as manic-depressive illness).  It can also be used to help prevent future manic and depressive episodes.  In some cases, it may be used as an adjunct therapy for other mood disorders.  It's crucial to note that lithium is *not* a quick fix; it typically takes several weeks to see its full therapeutic effect.  Its use must be strictly monitored by a physician due to its narrow therapeutic index (the difference between the effective dose and a toxic dose is small).


**Side Effects:**

Side effects can range from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, stomach cramps.
* **Neurological:** Tremors (shaking), drowsiness, dizziness, headache, fatigue, incoordination.
* **Renal:** Increased thirst, increased urination (polyuria),  potential for long-term kidney damage with prolonged use.
* **Cardiac:** Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias).
* **Endocrine:** Weight gain, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).
* **Other:** Acne, fine hand tremor, metallic taste in the mouth.


Severe side effects, while less common, are serious and require immediate medical attention.  These include:

* **Lithium toxicity:** Symptoms can range from mild (diarrhea, vomiting, muscle weakness) to severe (seizures, coma, death).
* **Kidney problems:**  Significant kidney damage can occur with long-term use.
* **Thyroid problems:** Hypothyroidism is a common side effect, and monitoring of thyroid function is essential.


**How it Works:**

The exact mechanism by which lithium carbonate works is not fully understood.  However, it is believed to affect various neurotransmitter systems in the brain, including those involving serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate.  This modulation of neurotransmitter activity helps stabilize mood and prevent extreme mood swings characteristic of bipolar disorder.


**FAQs:**

* **How is lithium carbonate administered?** It's usually taken orally as a tablet or capsule.  The dosage is carefully determined and adjusted by a physician based on blood lithium levels.

* **How often do I need blood tests?**  Regular blood tests are essential to monitor lithium levels and detect potential side effects, especially kidney and thyroid function.  Frequency depends on individual needs and can range from weekly to monthly.

* **Can I stop taking lithium carbonate suddenly?** No, stopping lithium carbonate abruptly can be dangerous and can trigger a relapse of symptoms.  It must be tapered off gradually under the close supervision of a physician.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking lithium carbonate?**  Alcohol can interfere with lithium's effectiveness and increase the risk of side effects. It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking lithium.

* **What are the interactions with other medications?**  Lithium carbonate can interact with several medications, including diuretics, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and certain antibiotics. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.

* **What are the long-term effects?** Long-term use of lithium can lead to kidney damage and thyroid problems. Regular monitoring is vital to detect and manage these risks.
