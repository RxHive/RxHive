# Lactitol + Benzoic Acid

There is no established or approved combination drug product containing Lactitol and Benzoic Acid.  These two substances are used separately for different purposes.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide details on a "generic Lactitol + Benzoic Acid" as such a combination doesn't exist in pharmaceutical practice.

Lactitol is a sugar alcohol laxative, and benzoic acid is a preservative and sometimes used medicinally in low doses. Combining them in a single formulation would be unusual and require careful consideration of potential interactions and efficacy.  Any information presented below would be purely hypothetical and should not be considered medical advice.
