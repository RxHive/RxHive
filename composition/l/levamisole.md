# Levamisole
### Generic Name
Levamisole

### Usage
Levamisole is primarily used as an anthelmintic, meaning it's effective against parasitic worms.  Specifically, it treats infestations of roundworms (ascariasis) and hookworms (ancylostomiasis), often in combination.  Importantly, levamisole also has a secondary, albeit less common, use in the treatment of Dukes' stage C colon cancer. In this context, it's used as an adjuvant therapy alongside fluorouracil after surgical resection, aiming to improve treatment outcomes.  It's crucial to understand that levamisole's use in cancer treatment is highly specialized and always occurs under the strict supervision of an oncologist.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Ascariasis:**  A single oral dose of 150 mg.
* **Mixed Ascariasis-Hookworm Infestations/Ancylostomiasis:** A single oral dose of 2.5 mg/kg. In severe cases, this dose may be repeated after 7 days.
* **Adjuvant Treatment for Dukes' Stage C Colon Cancer (with fluorouracil):**  Initial oral dose of 50 mg every 8 hours for 7-30 days post-surgery, followed by maintenance doses repeated every 14 days for a year.  This dosage regimen is strictly determined by the oncologist.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Ascariasis:**  A single oral dose of 3 mg/kg.
* **Mixed Ascariasis-Hookworm Infections/Ancylostomiasis:** A single oral dose of 2.5 mg/kg.  In severe cases, this dose may be repeated after 7 days.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments might be necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized dosage recommendations.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Muscle pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain

Less common, but serious side effects can include:

* Agranulocytosis (severely low white blood cell count)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Fever
* Flu-like symptoms
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Rash
* Taste disturbances
* Cutaneous vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels in the skin)

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these serious side effects.  Any unusual or concerning side effects warrant a consultation with your doctor or pharmacist.


### How it Works

Levamisole's anthelmintic effect stems from its action on the L-subtype nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the muscles of parasitic nematodes (worms).  This interaction paralyzes the worms, leading to their expulsion from the body.

Its mechanism of action in cancer treatment, when used with fluorouracil, isn't fully understood.  It's believed to enhance the immune system's response to the cancer, potentially by boosting the activity of immune cells such as T-cells and macrophages.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Levamisole is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to levamisole or its components, severe renal impairment, pre-existing blood disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, during pregnancy, and while breastfeeding.
* **Interactions:**  Levamisole may interact with other medications, potentially increasing the toxicity of phenytoin, increasing the bioavailability of ivermectin, or decreasing the bioavailability of albendazole.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Levamisole carries a risk of serious, even life-threatening, hematological side effects (affecting blood cells). Regular blood monitoring is crucial, especially during prolonged treatment.  Use caution in patients with hepatic impairment or Sjögren's syndrome.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking levamisole?** A:  No. Alcohol can increase the risk of side effects.
* **Q: How should I store levamisole?** A: Store as directed on the label, usually in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance. Do not double the dose to compensate for a missed dose.
* **Q: Is levamisole safe for pregnant women?** A: No, it's contraindicated during pregnancy.
* **Q: How long does it take for levamisole to work?** A: The effectiveness varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual's response.  Follow your doctor's instructions and report if you don’t see improvement.
* **Q: Can I stop taking levamisole once I feel better?** A: No, complete the full course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if symptoms improve. Stopping prematurely might lead to recurrence of the infection.
