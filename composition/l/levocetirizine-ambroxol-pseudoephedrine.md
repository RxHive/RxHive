# Levocetirizine + Ambroxol + Pseudoephedrine

**Generic Name:** Levocetirizine + Ambroxol + Pseudoephedrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, flu, or other upper respiratory infections.  It addresses multiple symptoms simultaneously:

* **Levocetirizine:**  Relieves allergic rhinitis symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes. It's an antihistamine.
* **Ambroxol:**  Helps loosen and thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up. It's a mucolytic.
* **Pseudoephedrine:**  Reduces nasal congestion by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages. It's a decongestant.

This combination is therefore useful for treating symptoms including: sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, nasal congestion, and cough with mucus.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage, but common ones include:

* **Levocetirizine related:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, fatigue, nausea.
* **Ambroxol related:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset.
* **Pseudoephedrine related:** Nervousness, insomnia, headache, increased blood pressure, palpitations, dizziness.  Rare but serious side effects include allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing).

**How it Works:**

* **Levocetirizine:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  This reduces allergic symptoms.
* **Ambroxol:** Increases the secretion of fluid in the respiratory tract, making mucus less viscous and easier to expel.
* **Pseudoephedrine:** Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood vessels of the nasal passages, causing them to constrict and reduce swelling, thereby relieving congestion.
