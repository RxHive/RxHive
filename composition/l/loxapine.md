# Loxapine

**Generic Name:** Loxapine

**Usage:** Loxapine is an antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia and manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder.  It can also be used to treat severe anxiety and agitation in certain situations, usually short-term.  The specific formulation (e.g., loxapine succinate, loxapine hydrochloride) influences the route of administration (oral, intramuscular).

**Side Effects:**  Loxapine, like other antipsychotics, can cause a range of side effects, varying in severity.  These can include:

* **Common Side Effects:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, weight gain, increased appetite, and changes in blood pressure (both increases and decreases).
* **Serious Side Effects:**  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) – a rare but potentially fatal condition characterized by muscle rigidity, high fever, altered mental status, and autonomic instability; tardive dyskinesia (TD) – a potentially irreversible movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, mouth, and tongue; extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as Parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia), akathisia (restlessness), and dystonia (muscle spasms); seizures; agranulocytosis (a serious decrease in white blood cells);  prolonged QT interval (potentially leading to serious heart rhythm problems); and orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing).
* **Other potential side effects:**  Sleep disturbances, sexual dysfunction, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight), and blood disorders.


**How it Works:** Loxapine is a dibenzoxazepine derivative that works primarily by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in several brain functions, including movement, mood, and thought processes. By blocking dopamine receptors, loxapine helps reduce the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) and the manic symptoms of bipolar disorder (e.g., elevated mood, racing thoughts). It also has some activity at other receptors, such as alpha-adrenergic receptors and serotonin receptors, which may contribute to its effects.


**FAQs:**

* **Is loxapine addictive?**  Loxapine is not considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids or stimulants. However, dependence can develop, meaning individuals may experience withdrawal symptoms if they suddenly stop taking the medication after long-term use.  Always consult a doctor before stopping loxapine.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking loxapine?**  Combining alcohol and loxapine can increase the risk of drowsiness, dizziness, and other side effects. It's generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.
* **Can I drive while taking loxapine?**  Loxapine can cause drowsiness and dizziness, which can impair driving ability.  Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how the medication affects you.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **What are the long-term effects of loxapine?**  Long-term use of loxapine can increase the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and other serious side effects. Regular monitoring by a doctor is essential.
