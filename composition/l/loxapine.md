# Loxapine
### Generic Name
Loxapine

### Usage

Loxapine is a first-generation antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat schizophrenia in adults.  It's also indicated for the short-term management of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder in adults experiencing acute episodes.  While primarily used for these conditions, its use in other scenarios is not supported by robust clinical evidence.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration (oral, intramuscular, inhalation), the specific condition being treated, and the individual patient's response.  **It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescription exactly.**  This information is for general knowledge and should not be used for self-medication.

**Adults:**

* **Schizophrenia (Oral):**  Treatment typically begins with a low dose (e.g., 10 mg twice daily) and is gradually increased over several days to weeks until symptoms are adequately controlled.  The maintenance dose usually falls within a range of 60-100 mg/day, but this can vary considerably depending on individual needs.  Doses exceeding 250 mg/day are not recommended.

* **Schizophrenia (Intramuscular):**  Intramuscular (IM) administration is used primarily for acute episodes of agitation, typically starting with a dose between 12.5 mg and 50 mg, repeated every 4-6 hours or as needed.  The frequency and dosage are adjusted based on patient response.

* **Acute Agitation (Oral Inhalation):**  The inhaled form is specifically for acute agitation.  The typical dose is 10 mg once only, with a maximum of 10 mg within a 24-hour period.  **This administration method requires professional medical supervision.**

* **Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of loxapine have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The need for dosage adjustments in patients with hepatic or renal impairment is not clearly defined in current prescribing information.  Always consult with a healthcare professional for guidance in such cases.


### Side Effects

Loxapine, like other antipsychotics, can cause several side effects.  The frequency and severity of these effects vary among individuals.

**Common Side Effects (Oral):**

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Weight changes
* Headache
* Tremor

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Oral & Inhalation):**

* **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):**  These involve involuntary muscle movements (e.g., muscle rigidity, tremors, restlessness) and can be quite distressing.
* **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):**  A rare but life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
* **Agranulocytosis:** A severe decrease in white blood cells, increasing susceptibility to infections.
* **Hypotension:** Low blood pressure, potentially causing dizziness or fainting.
* **Sedation:**  Significant drowsiness, impairing daily functioning.
* **Respiratory distress (Inhalation):**  Bronchospasm, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, and wheezing are potential risks associated with the inhaled formulation.

**If you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above, seek immediate medical attention.**

### How it Works

Loxapine is a dibenzoxazepine derivative that acts primarily by blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, movement, and thought processes.  Serotonin also plays a crucial role in mood regulation. By interfering with these neurotransmitters' activity, loxapine helps alleviate the symptoms of schizophrenia and acute agitation.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Loxapine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, severe CNS depression, coma, and those with certain respiratory conditions (particularly for the inhaled form).
* **Drug Interactions:** Loxapine can interact with other medications, particularly CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, alcohol, opioids). Concurrent use with these drugs should be approached cautiously, and dosage adjustments may be necessary. Metoclopramide should be avoided.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Loxapine is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are not fully understood.  Breastfeeding is generally not recommended while taking loxapine.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly patients, especially those with dementia-related psychosis, are at an increased risk of death when taking antipsychotic medications. Loxapine is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
* **Other Precautions:** Loxapine can cause orthostatic hypotension, making it crucial for patients to rise slowly from a lying or seated position.  Regular monitoring of blood counts and liver function may be necessary during treatment.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take loxapine with alcohol or other sedatives?**  A: No, combining loxapine with alcohol or other CNS depressants can significantly increase the risk of drowsiness, respiratory depression, and other adverse effects.  Avoid such combinations.

* **Q: How should I store loxapine?** A: Store loxapine as directed on the product label.  Generally, it should be kept in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking loxapine suddenly?** A: No, abrupt withdrawal can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping or changing your dosage.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Is loxapine addictive?** A: Physical dependence on loxapine is not typically observed, however, tolerance can develop.  Consult a doctor before making any medication changes.
