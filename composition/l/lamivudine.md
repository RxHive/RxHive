# Lamivudine
### Generic Name
Lamivudine

### Usage

Lamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) primarily used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.  In HIV-1 treatment, it's always used in combination with other antiretroviral medications, never as a single agent. For HBV, it can sometimes be used alone, but combination therapy is often preferred.  It's also employed in individuals co-infected with both HIV-1 and HBV.  The specific use and combination of drugs will depend on factors like the stage of infection, overall health, and other health conditions.

### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the infection being treated (HIV-1 or HBV), the patient's age and weight, and kidney function.  Always follow the prescribing physician’s guidance.

**HIV-1 Infection (Adult):** Oral administration.  Common regimens include 150 mg twice daily (BID) or 300 mg once daily (OD), always in combination with other antiretrovirals.

**Hepatitis B (Adult):** Oral administration. Typically, 100 mg once daily.

**HIV-1 Infection (Pediatric):** Oral solution or tablets. Dosage is calculated based on weight in mg/kg, administered every 12 hours or once daily, depending on age and weight. Specific ranges are outlined below, but always consult a physician for accurate dosage calculations.

* Neonates (<4 weeks): 2 mg/kg every 12 hours
* Infants (≥1 month): 4 mg/kg every 12 hours
* Infants (≥3 months): 5 mg/kg every 12 hours or 10 mg/kg daily (not exceeding 300 mg/day)
* Older Children: Tablet dosage is weight-based, ranging from 75 mg to 300 mg daily, depending on weight.

**Hepatitis B (Pediatric):**  Oral administration.  Dosage is determined by weight (3 mg/kg daily, not exceeding 100 mg/day) for children aged 2 years and older.  Safety and efficacy haven't been established in children under 2.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (renal impairment).  These adjustments depend on creatinine clearance (CrCl) levels and whether the patient is undergoing dialysis.  Specific adjustments for both HIV-1 and HBV treatment are detailed in the prescribing information and should be determined by a healthcare professional. No dosage adjustments are typically needed for liver impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Rash

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Lactic acidosis (build-up of lactic acid in the blood)
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities)
* Severe liver problems
* Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
* Exacerbation of Hepatitis B (in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV)

If any adverse effects occur, especially the serious ones listed above, contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Lamivudine is a nucleoside analog that interferes with the replication of both HIV-1 and HBV.  It gets incorporated into the viral DNA during the replication process, effectively stopping further viral growth. This process is called chain termination. Specifically, it inhibits reverse transcriptase in HIV and DNA polymerase in HBV, crucial enzymes for viral replication.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Lamivudine is contraindicated in individuals with a known allergy to the drug.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are crucial for individuals with kidney problems, as the drug is primarily eliminated through the kidneys.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  While dosage adjustments aren't typically needed for liver problems, monitoring liver function is essential.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Lamivudine is a Category C drug in pregnancy.  The benefits of using it to treat HIV should be carefully weighed against the potential risks to the fetus. Lamivudine is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding should be avoided if a mother is on this medication, particularly in cases of HIV infection.
* **Drug Interactions:** Lamivudine can interact with other medications.  It's important to inform a doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, before starting treatment with lamivudine.
* **Exacerbation of Hepatitis B:** Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may experience a worsening of hepatitis B upon discontinuation of lamivudine.  Close monitoring of liver function is necessary in these patients, even after treatment ends.
* **HIV Resistance:**  Using the wrong dosage, or using lamivudine intended for HBV treatment in patients with HIV, can lead to the development of drug-resistant viruses.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I take lamivudine with other medications?**

A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications you're taking, as lamivudine can interact with some drugs.


**Q: How should I store lamivudine?**

A: Store lamivudine as directed on the label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double up on doses.


**Q:  Can I stop taking lamivudine if I feel better?**

A: No.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to drug resistance and a relapse of the infection.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding the duration of treatment.


**Q: Is lamivudine safe for long-term use?**

A: Lamivudine has a long history of use, but long-term use can carry risks. Your doctor will monitor you for any adverse effects. Regular check-ups and blood tests are essential.
