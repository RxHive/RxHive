# Lorcaserin
### Generic Name
Lorcaserin

### Usage
Lorcaserin was a medication used to aid in weight loss. Specifically, it was prescribed for adults with obesity or overweight,  *in conjunction with* at least one weight-related comorbidity (a co-occurring medical condition).  Examples of such comorbidities include type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol.  It's crucial to understand that Lorcaserin was not a standalone solution for weight loss but rather an adjunct to lifestyle changes like diet and exercise.  **However, it is important to note that the marketing and distribution of Lorcaserin were discontinued in the US in February 2020 due to an increased risk of cancer.**  Therefore, this medication is no longer available for prescription.

### Dosage
**Important Note:** Because Lorcaserin is no longer available, the following dosage information is for historical reference only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for current use.

* **Adults (Obesity/Overweight with Comorbidity):**  The medication came in two forms: immediate-release tablets and extended-release tablets.  Dosages varied depending on the formulation.  Immediate-release tablets were typically prescribed as 10 mg twice daily (BID), while extended-release tablets were typically 20 mg once daily (OD).  If a 5% weight loss wasn't observed by week 12, treatment was generally discontinued.  The maximum daily dose was 20 mg.

* **Children:** Lorcaserin's safety and effectiveness were not established in children, so it was not prescribed for pediatric use.

* **Dosage Adjustments:** Adjustments were not usually necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic (liver) impairment. However, caution was advised for those with severe hepatic impairment.  For patients with renal (kidney) impairment, adjustments varied.  It was generally not recommended for individuals with severe impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

### Side Effects
* **Common Side Effects:** Headache, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nasal passages and pharynx).
* **Less Common, but Still Possible Side Effects:** Dizziness, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, back pain, constipation, dry mouth, vomiting, rash, musculoskeletal pain.
* **Serious Side Effects (though less frequent):**  While less common, there was a risk of decreased heart rate, cognitive impairment, problems with heart valves, and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).  The discontinuation of the drug was largely due to an increased risk of cancer.  **Any concerning side effects should be reported immediately to a healthcare provider.**

### How it Works
Lorcaserin is a selective serotonin 2C (5-HT2C) receptor agonist.  It works by activating specific serotonin receptors in the brain's hypothalamus, a region that plays a role in appetite regulation.  By activating these receptors, Lorcaserin is believed to promote feelings of fullness (satiety) and reduce the desire to eat, thereby aiding in weight loss. The precise mechanisms are not fully understood.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Lorcaserin was contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, and pregnant women.
* **Interactions:** Lorcaserin had potential interactions with several medications, including some antiparkinsonian agents, ajmaline, certain antipsychotic medications, and brexpiprazole.  Concurrent use with these medications was not recommended.
* **Warnings:** It was essential to exercise caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and breastfeeding women.  The risk of decreased heart rate, cognitive issues, valvular heart disease, and hypoglycemia was also a concern.  As previously mentioned, there was a demonstrated increased risk of cancer associated with the drug's use.
