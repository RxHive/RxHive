# Lorcaserin

**Generic Name:** Lorcaserin

**Usage:** Lorcaserin is a prescription medication used as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or greater (obese) or a BMI of 27 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition (such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or dyslipidemia).  It is intended for long-term use.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** This is often reported and usually mild.
* **Dizziness:** May be mild to moderate.
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling tired or lacking energy.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Dry mouth:**  A common side effect of many medications.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty passing stools.

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Such as rash, hives, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing. Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* **Serotonin syndrome:** This is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by symptoms such as high fever, rapid heart rate, muscle rigidity, confusion, and agitation. Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* **Valvular heart disease:** Lorcaserin has been linked to an increased risk of valvular heart disease, though the risk appears to be small. Regular cardiac monitoring may be recommended for some patients.

This is not an exhaustive list of side effects.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list and for advice on managing any side effects.

**How it Works:** Lorcaserin is a selective serotonin 2C receptor agonist. This means it works by activating specific serotonin receptors in the brain. This activation affects the brain's satiety centers, leading to increased feelings of fullness and decreased appetite, thus helping to reduce food intake and promote weight loss.
