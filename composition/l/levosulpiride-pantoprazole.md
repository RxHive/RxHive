# Levosulpiride + Pantoprazole

## Levosulpiride + Pantoprazole (Generic)

**Generic Name:**  This combination doesn't have a single generic name as it's not a pre-approved fixed-dose combination in most pharmacopoeias.  It's a combination of two separate generic drugs: Levosulpiride and Pantoprazole.

**Usage:** This combination is *not standardly prescribed* in a fixed-dose formulation.  Doctors might prescribe levosulpiride and pantoprazole separately to treat specific conditions where both drugs are indicated.  The combination is typically used off-label for conditions involving:

* **Gastrointestinal issues with associated nausea and vomiting:** Pantoprazole reduces stomach acid, while levosulpiride helps control nausea and vomiting. This might be used in conditions like gastritis, peptic ulcers, or gastroparesis complicated by nausea/vomiting.
* **Functional dyspepsia with associated nausea and vomiting:** Similarly to the above, this combination may be considered to address both the acid-related symptoms and nausea/vomiting in individuals with functional dyspepsia.

**Important Note:**  The use of this combination should be strictly under the guidance of a physician.  Self-medicating with this combination is dangerous and potentially harmful.


**Side Effects:** The side effects are a combination of those associated with levosulpiride and pantoprazole, individually.  These can include:

* **Levosulpiride:**  Hyperprolactinemia (increased prolactin levels, leading to potential galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia), extrapyramidal symptoms (parkinsonism-like symptoms), restlessness, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, dry mouth. Rarely, serious side effects like tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements) can occur with long-term use.
* **Pantoprazole:** Headache, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dizziness, rash, fatigue.  Rarely, more serious side effects like bone fractures, hypomagnesemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, and infections (due to reduced stomach acidity) can occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Levosulpiride:**  It's a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist.  It blocks the effects of dopamine in the brain, reducing nausea and vomiting by influencing the chemoreceptor trigger zone and the gastrointestinal tract. It also exhibits some prokinetic effects, enhancing gastric motility.
* **Pantoprazole:** It's a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).  It works by reducing the production of stomach acid by irreversibly blocking the hydrogen-potassium ATPase enzyme in the parietal cells of the stomach lining. This leads to decreased stomach acid secretion.
