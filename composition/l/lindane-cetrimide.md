# Lindane + Cetrimide
### Generic Name
Lindane + Cetrimide

**Note:**  A combination of Lindane and Cetrimide is not a standard, widely-approved pharmaceutical formulation.  Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) is a highly controversial insecticide and is largely banned or severely restricted in many countries due to neurotoxicity concerns.  Cetrimide is a topical antiseptic. Combining them is unusual and not supported by standard medical practice.  The information below is based on the individual properties of each component, recognizing the lack of established combined use.  **This information should not be interpreted as a recommendation for use.**  Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice and treatment.

### Usage

**Lindane:** Historically, Lindane was used topically to treat head lice and scabies.  However, due to its significant toxicity, its use is now highly restricted.  It's crucial to emphasize that self-treating with Lindane is extremely dangerous.

**Cetrimide:** Cetrimide is a topical antiseptic used to disinfect skin and mucous membranes. It's effective against a range of bacteria, but not against viruses or fungi.  It's often used as a skin cleanser before surgery or to treat minor wounds.


### Dosage

**No established dosage for a combined Lindane and Cetrimide formulation exists.**  Dosage information below refers to the *individual* components and should not be interpreted as a guide for mixing and administering these substances.

**Lindane (Historically, when permitted):**  Dosage varied widely depending on the specific formulation and condition being treated. Instructions would have been provided with the product and must be followed meticulously.

**Cetrimide:** The concentration of Cetrimide solutions varies.  Typical concentrations range from 0.1% to 1%.  Dosage depends on the area to be treated and the specific product instructions.


### Side Effects

**Lindane:**  The significant side effects of Lindane include neurological symptoms (seizures, tremors, headaches, dizziness), skin irritation, and allergic reactions.  Severe cases can be fatal.

**Cetrimide:**  While generally well-tolerated, Cetrimide can cause skin irritation, dryness, and allergic reactions in some individuals.


### How it Works

**Lindane:** Lindane works by interfering with the nervous system of insects, causing paralysis and death.  Its mechanism in humans involves similar disruptions to the nervous system, accounting for its toxicity.

**Cetrimide:** Cetrimide disrupts the bacterial cell membrane, leading to cell death. This is a non-specific mechanism, meaning it affects a broad range of bacteria.


### Precautions

**Lindane:** Lindane is highly toxic and should never be used without explicit medical supervision. Itâ€™s contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women, infants, children, and individuals with neurological conditions or seizures.  It is crucial to avoid inhalation or ingestion.

**Cetrimide:** Avoid contact with eyes and broken skin.  Use only as directed.
