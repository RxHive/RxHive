# Levosalbutamol + Ambroxol + Guaifenesin

**Generic Name:** Levosalbutamol + Ambroxol + Guaifenesin

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat symptoms of respiratory tract infections, particularly those involving bronchitis and other conditions with productive cough (coughing up phlegm).  It's aimed at relieving symptoms such as:

* **Wheezing:** Levosalbutamol, a bronchodilator, helps open the airways.
* **Shortness of breath:** Also relieved by the bronchodilating effect of levosalbutamol.
* **Chest tightness:**  Related to airway constriction, which levosalbutamol addresses.
* **Productive cough:** Ambroxol and guaifenesin are expectorants, meaning they help thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up.

**It's crucial to note:** This combination is symptomatic treatment only. It doesn't cure the underlying infection.  A doctor's diagnosis and appropriate treatment for the infection are necessary. This medication should not be used for long-term relief or prevention of respiratory symptoms.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage.  Common side effects can include:

* **Tremors:**  A common side effect of levosalbutamol, especially at higher doses.
* **Nausea:**  Can be associated with any of the components.
* **Headache:**  Relatively common.
* **Dizziness:**  Less frequent.
* **Insomnia:**  In some individuals.
* **Gastrointestinal upset:** Including stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions such as skin rash, itching, or swelling can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.

**How it Works:**

* **Levosalbutamol:** This is a beta-2 agonist. It works by relaxing the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe. This helps relieve wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.

* **Ambroxol:** This is an expectorant. It helps thin and loosen mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up. It does this by stimulating the production of surfactant, a substance in the lungs that helps keep the airways clear.

* **Guaifenesin:**  Another expectorant, guaifenesin also helps thin mucus, making it easier to cough up phlegm. It works by increasing the fluid content of the mucus.

The combination of these three active ingredients aims to provide comprehensive relief from the symptoms of respiratory tract infections.
