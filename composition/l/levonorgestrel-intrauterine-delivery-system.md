# Levonorgestrel intrauterine delivery system

**Generic Name:** Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS)  *(Note:  There isn't one single generic name, as different manufacturers will have slightly different branding.  LNG-IUS is the most accurate general term.)*

**Usage:**  Long-term reversible contraception (up to 7 years depending on the specific brand), treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia).

**Side Effects:**  These can vary in severity and frequency among individuals. Common side effects include:

* **Changes in menstrual bleeding:** This is the most common side effect.  Many women experience lighter periods, spotting, or amenorrhea (absence of periods).  Some may experience heavier bleeding initially.
* **Mood changes:**  Some users report changes in mood, including depression, anxiety, or irritability.
* **Acne:**  Hormonal changes can exacerbate acne in some individuals.
* **Weight changes:**  Weight gain or loss is possible, although studies show minimal impact on average.
* **Headaches:** Increased frequency or severity of headaches.
* **Ovarian cysts:**  Small cysts may develop on the ovaries.  These are usually benign and often resolve spontaneously.
* **Pain during insertion or removal:** This is temporary.
* **Expulsion:** The IUD can be expelled from the uterus, although this is relatively infrequent.
* **Infection:**  Infection is a rare but serious complication. Symptoms include fever, chills, abdominal pain.
* **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID):** A rare but serious risk, particularly in the weeks following insertion.
* **Ectopic pregnancy:** While rare, pregnancy can still occur, and if it does, it's more likely to be ectopic (outside the uterus).


**How it Works:** The LNG-IUS releases a small amount of levonorgestrel, a progestin hormone, into the uterus. This hormone primarily works by:

* **Thickening cervical mucus:** This prevents sperm from reaching the egg.
* **Thinning the uterine lining:** This makes it less hospitable for implantation of a fertilized egg.
* **Suppressing ovulation:** Although not its primary mechanism, it can reduce or prevent ovulation in some women.


**FAQs:**

* **How effective is it?**  The LNG-IUS is highly effective, with a pregnancy rate of less than 1% per year.
* **How long does it last?**  Most LNG-IUS devices are effective for 5-7 years, depending on the brand.
* **Can I get pregnant immediately after removal?** Yes, fertility usually returns quickly after removal.
* **Is it painful to get inserted?**  Many women experience some cramping during insertion, but pain levels vary greatly.  Pain medication is often provided.

* **What are the signs of expulsion?**  You might notice the strings are longer, shorter, or missing, or experience increased bleeding or pain.
* **What if I want to get pregnant before the 5-7 year period is up?** Your doctor can remove the IUD at any time.
* **Who should not use an LNG-IUS?**  Women with certain conditions, such as current breast cancer, unexplained vaginal bleeding, or known or suspected pregnancy, should not use an LNG-IUS. Your doctor will assess your suitability.
* **Are there any long-term health effects?**  Long-term studies show no significant adverse health effects for the vast majority of users.  However, individual responses can vary.
