# Levonorgestrel intrauterine delivery system
### Generic Name
Levonorgestrel Intrauterine System (IUS)


### Usage
The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) is primarily used for long-term contraception.  It prevents pregnancy by thickening the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg, and thinning the uterine lining, making it less hospitable for implantation.  While its primary use is contraception, studies show it can also be effective in reducing menstrual bleeding, particularly in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia).  Some healthcare providers may also consider it for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain, although this is not its primary indication and other treatments might be more suitable.


### Dosage
The levonorgestrel IUS is a single device inserted into the uterus by a healthcare professional.  There's no oral or IV form.  The device continuously releases a low dose of levonorgestrel over a period of 3-5 years (depending on the specific brand), after which it needs to be removed and replaced if continued contraception is desired.  Dosage is determined by the device itself; there is no adjustment based on age, weight, or condition severity. The healthcare provider will determine the appropriate insertion time based on the patient's menstrual cycle.


### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Irregular bleeding or spotting (this is the most common)
* Mood changes
* Weight changes (gain or loss)
* Acne
* Headaches
* Breast tenderness

Less common, but serious side effects, requiring immediate medical attention, may include:

* Severe pelvic pain
* Signs of infection (fever, chills, unusual vaginal discharge)
* Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus)
* Perforation of the uterus (rare but serious)


If you experience any unusual side effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
The levonorgestrel IUS works primarily by delivering a small, steady dose of the hormone levonorgestrel directly into the uterus. This hormone thickens the cervical mucus, creating a physical barrier that prevents sperm from reaching the egg.  Furthermore, levonorgestrel thins the uterine lining (endometrium), making it less likely that a fertilized egg will implant. The reduction in endometrial thickness also contributes to the lessening of menstrual blood flow.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** The IUS shouldn't be used if you have a current pelvic infection, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, known or suspected pregnancy, a history of ectopic pregnancy, cervical cancer, or certain types of uterine abnormalities. Women with a history of breast cancer or blood clots should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor carefully before using this method.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Generally, there are no known significant drug interactions with the levonorgestrel IUS.  However, it's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Specific Warnings:**  Pregnant women should absolutely not use the IUS.  Women who are breastfeeding can generally use it safely, although some minor changes in milk production have been reported.  Older adults face similar risks and benefits as other age groups, though the consideration of menopause should be factored in when deciding on long-term contraceptive choices.


### FAQs

* **Q: How effective is the levonorgestrel IUS?** A: It's highly effective at preventing pregnancy, with a failure rate of less than 1%.

* **Q: How long does it take to be effective?** A: It's effective immediately after insertion for contraception, though irregular bleeding may occur initially.

* **Q: Can I remove the IUS myself?** A: No.  The IUS must be removed by a healthcare professional.

* **Q: What if I want to get pregnant after having the IUS?** A: Once removed, fertility usually returns quickly.

* **Q: Does the IUS protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?** A: No.  The IUS only protects against pregnancy; barrier methods (like condoms) are necessary to protect against STIs.

* **Q: How should I store the IUS before insertion?** A: The IUS will be stored and handled by your healthcare provider prior to insertion. It's not for personal storage.

* **Q: Can I feel the IUS?** A:  Generally, no, but you may be aware of its presence during menstruation or sexual activity for a brief period. However, significant discomfort usually indicates a problem and warrants medical attention.
