# Levonorgestrel
### Generic Name
Levonorgestrel

### Usage
Levonorgestrel is primarily used as an emergency contraceptive, often referred to as the "morning-after pill."  It works by preventing or delaying ovulation, fertilization, or implantation of a fertilized egg.  This makes it effective in reducing the chance of pregnancy after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure (like a broken condom or missed pill).  While its primary use is emergency contraception, levonorgestrel is also a component of some combined oral contraceptives (birth control pills) and is available as a progestin-only birth control pill (POP) for long-term contraception. In the latter case, it works primarily by thickening cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg, and potentially thinning the uterine lining, making implantation less likely.


### Dosage

**Emergency Contraception:**  The standard dose is a single 1.5 mg tablet of levonorgestrel taken within 72 hours (3 days) of unprotected sex, the sooner the better.  Some formulations may require two doses, taken 12 hours apart, as directed on the packaging.  There is no dosage adjustment based on age or weight for emergency use.

**Long-term Contraception (POP):**  Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation of the progestin-only pill.  Typically, it involves taking one tablet daily at approximately the same time each day.  Consult the medication packaging or your doctor for exact dosage instructions.

**Note:** Levonorgestrel is not available as an intravenous (IV) medication.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, dizziness, breast tenderness, changes in menstrual bleeding (lighter, heavier, or delayed).
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Severe abdominal pain (may indicate ectopic pregnancy), allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing), severe dizziness or fainting.  

**Important:** If you experience any severe or persistent side effects, seek immediate medical attention.  


### How it Works

Levonorgestrel is a synthetic progestin hormone, similar to progesterone produced naturally in the body.  As an emergency contraceptive, it primarily works by delaying or inhibiting ovulationâ€”the release of an egg from the ovary. It can also thicken cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach and fertilize an egg.  In some cases, it may prevent implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterine lining.  In long-term contraception, these mechanisms are utilized to prevent pregnancy on an ongoing basis.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Levonorgestrel should not be used if you are allergic to it or its components.  It is not effective as an abortifacient (it will not terminate an established pregnancy).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Some medications may interact with levonorgestrel; it's essential to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.  Certain enzyme-inducing drugs can potentially reduce the effectiveness of levonorgestrel.
* **Warnings:**  Levonorgestrel does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  Use a barrier method (like condoms) in addition to levonorgestrel to reduce the risk of STIs.  While generally safe, levonorgestrel might not be suitable for all individuals.  Women with certain liver conditions or a history of ectopic pregnancy may need to discuss its use with their physician.
