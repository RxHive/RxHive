# Levonorgestrel

**Generic Name:** Levonorgestrel

**Usage:** Levonorgestrel is primarily used as emergency contraception ("morning-after pill") to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure.  It can also be found in some progestin-only birth control pills and intrauterine devices (IUDs).  The specific usage will depend on the formulation (pill, IUD).  For emergency contraception, it's most effective when taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the formulation and individual response. Common side effects include:

* **Emergency Contraception:** Irregular bleeding, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, dizziness, breast tenderness.
* **Progestin-only Pills/IUDs:** Irregular bleeding or spotting, mood changes, weight changes, acne, decreased libido, breast tenderness.  (These are long-term effects, unlike the emergency contraception use).

It's crucial to note that serious side effects are rare but can include severe abdominal pain suggestive of ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus) or other serious complications.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe abdominal pain.

**How it Works:**

* **Emergency Contraception:** Levonorgestrel primarily works by delaying or preventing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary).  It may also thicken cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm to reach the egg, and potentially interfere with fertilization or implantation.  It does *not* induce abortion.

* **Progestin-only Pills/IUDs:**  Levonorgestrel in these formulations primarily thickens cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg and preventing fertilization.  It also may affect the uterine lining, making implantation less likely.
