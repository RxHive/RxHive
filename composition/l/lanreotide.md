# Lanreotide
### Generic Name
Lanreotide

### Usage

Lanreotide is a synthetic somatostatin analog, a type of medication that mimics the actions of the naturally occurring hormone somatostatin.  Its primary use is in the long-term management of acromegaly in adults who haven't responded adequately to, or can't be treated with, surgery and/or radiotherapy. Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder characterized by excessive growth hormone production, leading to enlarged hands, feet, and facial features.  

Lanreotide also plays a crucial role in improving progression-free survival for adults with unresectable, well- or moderately differentiated, locally advanced, or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs).  Furthermore, it's used to treat carcinoid syndrome in adults, a condition caused by tumors that release excessive amounts of hormones, leading to symptoms like flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing.  Pre-operatively, Lanreotide may also be used to help reduce growth hormone levels before surgery for acromegaly.


### Dosage

Lanreotide is administered via subcutaneous (SubQ) or intramuscular (IM) injection.  Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response.

**Acromegaly (SubQ):**

* **Initial:**  The FDA-approved initial dose is typically 90 mg every 4 weeks for 3 months.
* **Maintenance:**  After the initial 3 months, the dose is adjusted based on growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, as well as symptom control.  Dosages can range from 60 mg to 120 mg every 4 weeks. In some cases, an extended dosing interval of 120 mg every 6 or 8 weeks may be considered.


**Acromegaly (Preoperative, IM):**

* Typically, 30 mg every 2 weeks for 3 months before trans-sphenoidal surgery. The dose might be increased to 30 mg weekly after 8 weeks if needed.  This is considered off-label use.

**GEP-NETs and Carcinoid Syndrome (SubQ):**

* The usual dose is 120 mg every 4 weeks.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with moderate or severe hepatic or renal impairment.  Geriatric patients may start with a lower dose.  Pediatric use is not established.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling, itching)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Weight loss


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Gallstones (cholelithiasis) and gallbladder sludge
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Allergic reactions (angioedema, anaphylaxis)
* Heart valve problems


Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Lanreotide works by binding to somatostatin receptors on various cells in the body. This binding inhibits the release of several hormones, including growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and other hormones involved in GEP-NETs and carcinoid syndrome.  By reducing the levels of these hormones, Lanreotide helps to alleviate the symptoms and improve the prognosis of the conditions it treats.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Lanreotide is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to lanreotide, somatostatin, or related peptides, and those with complicated, untreated bile duct stones.
* **Interactions:** Lanreotide may interact with several other medications, including quinidine, cyclosporine, terfenadine, pegvisomant, bromocriptine, and antidiabetic agents.  Concomitant use requires careful monitoring.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Lanreotide is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the risk to the fetus is not fully known. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose.
* **Special Populations:** Patients with diabetes, pre-existing cardiac disease, moderate-to-severe hepatic or renal impairment require careful monitoring and dose adjustment.


### FAQs

**Q: How is Lanreotide administered?**

A: Lanreotide is administered via deep subcutaneous injection into the buttock.


**Q: How long does it take to see results?**

A: The time it takes to see results varies depending on the condition and individual response.  For acromegaly, significant improvement may take several months.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Consult your doctor as soon as possible to determine how to proceed.


**Q: How should I store Lanreotide?**

A: Store Lanreotide in the refrigerator.


**Q:  Are there any long-term effects?**

A: Long-term use may be associated with an increased risk of gallstones and other side effects. Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is crucial.
