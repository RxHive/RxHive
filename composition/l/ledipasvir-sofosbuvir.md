# Ledipasvir + Sofosbuvir
### Generic Name
Ledipasvir + Sofosbuvir

### Usage

Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir is a combination medication used to treat chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus infection.  It's a fixed-dose combination of two drugs: ledipasvir, an NS5A inhibitor, and sofosbuvir, an NS5B polymerase inhibitor. Both target different parts of the hepatitis C virus's replication cycle, working together to significantly reduce or eliminate the virus from the body.  This combination therapy is effective against several genotypes of HCV (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), making it a versatile treatment option. The specific genotype of the HCV infection influences the recommended treatment duration and whether additional medications, like ribavirin, are necessary.

### Dosage

Dosage depends heavily on several factors including the patient's age, weight, HCV genotype, presence of cirrhosis (liver scarring), and treatment history (treatment-naïve versus treatment-experienced).  The following information is a summary and **should not replace guidance from a healthcare professional.**  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Adults:**  The typical adult dose is one tablet (containing 90 mg ledipasvir and 400 mg sofosbuvir) once daily.  The duration of treatment varies widely (8 to 24 weeks) based on the factors mentioned above.  In some cases, ribavirin may be added to the regimen, especially for patients with decompensated cirrhosis or certain genotypes.  Ribavirin dosage is weight-based and adjusted according to tolerance.

**Children:**  Pediatric formulations of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir are available as tablets and pellets (for easier administration). The dose is weight-based and determined by a physician, taking into account the child's age, weight and the specific HCV infection. Ribavirin might be included in the regimen, with dosing adjusted for the child's weight.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Asthenia (weakness or lack of energy)
* Insomnia
* Dizziness
* Irritability
* Depression
* Myalgia (muscle pain)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Reactivation of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients co-infected with HBV
* Skin rash
* Serious bradycardia (slow heart rate) – particularly when used with amiodarone
* Increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis (muscle damage) – particularly when used with rosuvastatin

If you experience any concerning side effects, immediately contact your healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Ledipasvir works by blocking the NS5A protein, which is essential for HCV replication. Sofosbuvir, on the other hand, inhibits the NS5B polymerase enzyme, another key component in the viral replication process. By targeting these two crucial steps in the HCV life cycle, the combination effectively stops the virus from multiplying and ultimately leads to a reduction or eradication of the viral load.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.  It's also contraindicated during pregnancy for both men and women (due to ribavirin use in some cases).
* **Drug Interactions:** Several medications may interact with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir, potentially altering its effectiveness or causing adverse effects.  These include certain antacids, anticonvulsants, antimycobacterials, amiodarone, digoxin, rosuvastatin, and others.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications you're taking.
* **Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation:**  Patients co-infected with HBV are at risk of HBV reactivation during or after Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir treatment.  Monitoring for HBV reactivation is essential.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The combination is contraindicated in pregnancy. The decision to breastfeed while on this medication should be made in consultation with your physician, carefully weighing the risks and benefits.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are typically not needed for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, but individual assessment is crucial.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir with food?** A:  The tablets can be taken with or without food.  Pellets should be mixed with non-acidic soft foods and swallowed within 30 minutes.
* **Q: How long does treatment typically last?** A: Treatment duration varies considerably depending on several factors, including HCV genotype, treatment history, and the presence of cirrhosis.  Your doctor will determine the optimal treatment duration.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist for advice on how to manage missed doses.  Do not double the dose without medical guidance.
* **Q: How is the medication stored?** A: Store the medication as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of this medication?** A:  Long-term effects are generally considered minimal after successful HCV treatment. However, regular follow-up visits with your physician are recommended to monitor your liver health.
