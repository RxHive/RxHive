# L-Methyl Folate + Methylcobalamin + Vitamin B + Vitamin E

**Generic Name:** L-Methylfolate, Methylcobalamin, Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine), Vitamin B12 (as Methylcobalamin), Vitamin E (Tocopherols)  *(Note:  This is a combination product, so there isn't one single generic name. This lists the individual generic names of the components.)*

**Usage:** This combination supplement is often used to support:

* **Cognitive function:**  Methylfolate and methylcobalamin are crucial for brain health and neurotransmitter synthesis.  B6 also plays a role.
* **Cardiovascular health:**  Certain B vitamins, including folate and B6, are involved in homocysteine metabolism. Elevated homocysteine levels are linked to increased cardiovascular risk. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that may protect cells from damage.
* **Energy production:** B vitamins are essential coenzymes in energy metabolism.
* **Nerve function:** B vitamins, particularly B12 and folate, are vital for nerve health.
* **Mood support:** Some studies suggest a link between B vitamin deficiencies and mood disorders.


**Side Effects:**  Generally well-tolerated, but potential side effects can include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, diarrhea, or constipation (especially at higher doses).
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, or swelling (rare).
* **Headache:**  Less common, but possible.
* **Interactions with medications:** This combination can interact with certain medications, especially those affecting blood clotting or folate metabolism.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications.

*Note: The specific side effects and their frequency will vary depending on the dosage and individual sensitivity.*

**How it Works:**

* **L-Methylfolate (5-MTHF):** The active form of folate, readily used by the body without requiring conversion. Essential for DNA synthesis, cell division, and neurotransmitter production.
* **Methylcobalamin:** The active form of vitamin B12, crucial for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
* **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):** Plays a crucial role in many metabolic processes, including neurotransmitter synthesis, homocysteine metabolism, and immune function.
* **Vitamin E (Tocopherols):** Powerful antioxidants that protect cells from oxidative damage, potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases.
