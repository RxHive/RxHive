# Leflunomide

**Generic Name:** Leflunomide

**Usage:**

Leflunomide is used to treat the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults. It's a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) which means it slows the progression of the disease and helps to prevent joint damage.  It's often used in combination with other medications, particularly methotrexate, for better efficacy.  It may also be used as a monotherapy if other treatments are unsuitable.


**Side Effects:**

Leflunomide can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others more serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea:** This is frequently reported and can be significant enough to warrant discontinuation of the drug.
* **Nausea:**  A common gastrointestinal side effect.
* **Headache:**  A relatively common side effect.
* **Hair loss (alopecia):** Can be temporary or persistent.
* **Increased liver enzymes:**  This requires regular monitoring of liver function tests.
* **Elevated blood pressure:**  Regular blood pressure checks are advised.
* **Rash:** Allergic reactions can occur.
* **Fatigue:** A common symptom.
* **Weakness:**  May be related to fatigue or other side effects.

More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* **Severe liver damage:** This is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect.
* **Low white blood cell count (leukopenia):** Increases risk of infection.
* **Low red blood cell count (anemia):** Can cause fatigue and weakness.
* **Lung problems:**  Such as interstitial lung disease.
* **Serious allergic reactions:** Requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:** Numbness or tingling in the extremities.


**How it Works:**

Leflunomide inhibits the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, which are essential building blocks for DNA and RNA. By interfering with their production, leflunomide interferes with the proliferation of rapidly dividing cells, including those involved in the inflammatory processes characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis. This ultimately reduces inflammation and slows down the progression of joint damage.  The exact mechanism is complex and not fully understood.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?**  It can take several weeks or even months to notice a significant improvement in symptoms.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking leflunomide?**  It's generally recommended to limit alcohol consumption while on leflunomide, as it can increase the risk of liver damage. Your doctor can provide specific advice.
* **How is leflunomide discontinued?**  Because leflunomide has a long half-life, a specific procedure using cholestyramine or activated charcoal is required to accelerate its elimination from the body if treatment needs to be stopped, especially in case of significant side effects or planned pregnancy.  This is crucial to minimize the risk of long-term side effects.
* **Can I take leflunomide if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Leflunomide is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.  It can cause serious birth defects.  Reliable contraception is essential for women of childbearing age.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed as serious above.
