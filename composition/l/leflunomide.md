# Leflunomide
### Generic Name
Leflunomide

### Usage

Leflunomide's primary use is in treating adults with active rheumatoid arthritis.  It's an immunomodulatory drug, meaning it modifies the body's immune response to help control the inflammation and joint damage characteristic of this autoimmune disease.  It's not a cure for rheumatoid arthritis, but it can significantly reduce symptoms and improve joint function.

While not officially approved for these conditions, leflunomide is sometimes used off-label in other situations. This includes treating psoriatic arthritis, a similar inflammatory condition affecting the joints and skin,  and managing BK virus (in kidney transplant recipients) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections (again, in transplant patients, often as an adjunct to standard antiviral treatment).  These off-label uses should only be considered under the close supervision of a physician due to the potential for serious side effects and the lack of extensive clinical trial data supporting these applications.


### Dosage

**Rheumatoid Arthritis (Adult):**  Treatment typically starts with an optional loading dose of 100mg once daily for three days.  This loading dose is sometimes omitted due to the increased risk of side effects such as diarrhea, particularly in those with pre-existing liver or blood issues or those already on other immunosuppressants. The usual maintenance dose is 20mg once daily, which may be reduced to 10mg once daily if the higher dose is poorly tolerated.  It is important to note that because the active metabolite of leflunomide has a long half-life, it may take a considerable amount of time for blood levels to decrease after dose adjustments.


**Other Conditions (Adult, Off-Label):**  Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated (BK virus, CMV, psoriatic arthritis) and is highly individualized, determined by a physician based on the patient's response and tolerance.  Loading doses and maintenance doses may differ from those used for rheumatoid arthritis.


**Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of leflunomide in children have not been established.  While off-label use in juvenile idiopathic arthritis has been reported, it requires careful consideration by specialists and should only be undertaken under strict medical supervision due to concerns about potential side effects and developing organ systems. The dosage in children, when used off-label, would be carefully calculated based on weight and age and would likely be significantly lower than adult doses.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Skin rash


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* High blood pressure (hypertension)
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity), including serious liver injury and even liver failure.  Regular liver function tests are crucial.
* Blood disorders (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia)
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Lung problems (interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis)
* Infections (including opportunistic infections)
* Increased risk of serious infections like tuberculosis or pneumonia.


If any side effects occur, especially serious ones, consult a doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Leflunomide is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form in the body.  This active metabolite inhibits the production of pyrimidines, which are essential building blocks for DNA and RNA. By interfering with pyrimidine synthesis, leflunomide reduces the proliferation (growth and division) of immune cells, particularly those involved in the inflammatory process in rheumatoid arthritis.  This leads to a decrease in inflammation and slows down the progression of joint damage.  The mechanism of action in its off-label uses is less well-defined, but it's believed to interfere with viral replication in the case of CMV and BK virus.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Leflunomide is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy due to a high risk of birth defects and fetal harm. Women of childbearing age must use effective contraception during treatment and for a significant period (at least two years or until active metabolite levels fall below a certain threshold) after treatment ends.  An accelerated drug elimination procedure may be used to speed up the clearance of the medication.

* **Liver Function:**  Leflunomide can cause liver damage.  Regular monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is essential, especially at the beginning of treatment.  The drug is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment.

* **Kidney Function:** While no formal dose adjustments are recommended for mild to moderate kidney disease, use should be cautious.

* **Infections:** Leflunomide suppresses the immune system, increasing the risk of infections. Patients should report any signs of infection immediately.  Screening for latent tuberculosis is recommended before starting treatment.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Leflunomide can interact with many other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Other Conditions:**  Leflunomide should be used cautiously in patients with existing blood disorders, bone marrow suppression, severe hypoproteinemia, or a history of infections.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from leflunomide?** A: The onset of action varies, but improvements in symptoms are usually noticed within several weeks.  However, the full therapeutic effect may take several months.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking leflunomide?** A: Alcohol can potentially increase the risk of liver damage, so it's best to limit or avoid alcohol consumption while on leflunomide. Consult your physician.

* **Q: How is leflunomide stored?** A: Store leflunomide at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double up on doses.

* **Q: Can I stop taking leflunomide suddenly?** A: No, stopping leflunomide abruptly is not recommended.  Your doctor will provide guidance on gradually reducing the dose to minimize the risk of rebound effects.  An accelerated elimination procedure may be needed.
