# Low Dextrans

**Generic Name:** Dextran 40, Dextran 70 (Note:  The number refers to the average molecular weight in kilodaltons.  Other molecular weight dextrans exist but are less common.)

**Usage:**

Dextran 40 and Dextran 70 are used primarily as plasma volume expanders. This means they temporarily increase the volume of blood plasma, which is the liquid part of blood.  They are used in situations where there's a significant loss of blood volume, such as:

* **Hypovolemic shock:**  A life-threatening condition caused by severe blood or fluid loss.
* **Surgery:** To help maintain blood volume during and after major surgery.
* **Trauma:** To treat blood loss from injuries.
* **Burns:** To counteract fluid loss from extensive burns.

Dextran 40 is preferred for its slightly lower viscosity. Dextran 70 has a longer lasting effect but higher viscosity, so is selected for situations needing prolonged plasma volume expansion.  Specific usage and choice of dextran depends on the clinical situation and physician's judgement.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can range from mild to severe and include:

* **Mild:**  Headache, nausea, vomiting, flushing, chills, feeling faint or weak.
* **Moderate:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives), swelling, pain at injection site.
* **Severe:**  Anaphylactic shock (a life-threatening allergic reaction), fluid overload (pulmonary edema), bleeding (due to interference with platelet function), kidney problems (renal failure),  hypotension (low blood pressure).


**How it Works:**

Dextrans are large carbohydrate molecules that draw fluid from the tissues into the bloodstream. This increases the plasma volume, improving blood pressure and tissue perfusion (blood flow to tissues).  The effect is temporary as the dextrans are gradually metabolized and excreted by the body.

**FAQs:**

* **How long do the effects of dextran last?** The duration of effect varies depending on the molecular weight and the dose, but generally ranges from several hours to a few days.
* **Are there any specific precautions I should take?**  Patients with a history of allergies, kidney problems, or heart failure should be monitored closely. Dextrans can interfere with blood typing and cross-matching, so this should be considered.  Regular monitoring of blood pressure, urine output, and fluid balance is crucial.
* **Is dextran a blood substitute?** No. Dextran is a plasma volume expander, not a blood substitute. It does not replace the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells.
* **Can I take dextran orally?** No. Dextran is administered intravenously (IV) only.
* **Are there any drug interactions?**  Dextran can interact with certain medications; consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions.
* **What is the difference between Dextran 40 and Dextran 70?**  Dextran 40 has a lower molecular weight, resulting in lower viscosity and faster excretion. Dextran 70 has a higher molecular weight, leading to a longer-lasting effect but higher viscosity. The choice depends on clinical needs.
