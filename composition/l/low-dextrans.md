# Low Dextrans
### Generic Name
Low Dextran

### Usage
Low dextran is a plasma volume expander used primarily in emergency situations to treat hypovolemic shock or impending shock.  This means it's used when there's a significant loss of blood volume, leading to dangerously low blood pressure. It's specifically indicated for situations where blood or blood products aren't readily available or are contraindicated. Low dextran acts as a short-term fluid replacement, temporarily increasing blood volume to improve circulation and blood pressure.  It's crucial to understand that low dextran is a *supplement* to other necessary treatments for shock, not a standalone cure.

### Dosage
Dosage of low dextran is highly individualized and determined by the severity of the shock, the patient's weight, and ongoing fluid and electrolyte status.  A physician will carefully calculate the appropriate dose.  It's typically administered intravenously (IV) as a solution. Specific dosage instructions are provided by the healthcare professional based on the individual patient's needs.  There is no standardized dosage for children or adults universally applicable, as itâ€™s always dependent on the specific clinical scenario.  The administration rate is also closely monitored to prevent complications.


### Side Effects
* **Common side effects:**  Fluid overload, headache, nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives).
* **Less common, but serious side effects:**  Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), bleeding complications (due to interference with blood clotting), kidney problems (renal failure), increased risk of infection.
* **Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any adverse effects, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Low dextran is a large molecule that stays within the bloodstream.  This increases the osmotic pressure of the blood, drawing fluid from the tissues into the blood vessels. This increases the circulating blood volume and helps restore blood pressure to safer levels.  The effect is temporary as the body gradually metabolizes and eliminates the dextran.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Low dextran should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to dextran or any of its components.  It should also be used cautiously in individuals with heart failure, kidney disease, or bleeding disorders.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Low dextran may interact with other medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners). It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of low dextran during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Its use should be carefully weighed against potential benefits and risks by a healthcare professional.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, particularly fluid overload and kidney problems.  Careful monitoring is crucial.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the effect of low dextran last?**  A: The effect is temporary and lasts only as long as the dextran remains in the bloodstream, typically a few hours to a couple of days depending on the molecular weight and individual metabolism.

* **Q: Can I take low dextran without a doctor's prescription?** A: No. Low dextran is a prescription medication and should only be administered under the strict supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.  Self-administration can be extremely dangerous.

* **Q: How is low dextran stored?** A:  Storage instructions are provided with the specific product. Generally, it should be stored at room temperature, protected from light and extreme temperatures.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, or hives.
