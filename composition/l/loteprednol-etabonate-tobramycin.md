# Loteprednol etabonate + Tobramycin

**Generic Name:** Loteprednol etabonate/Tobramycin ophthalmic suspension

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to treat bacterial and inflammatory eye infections.  Loteprednol etabonate is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and swelling. Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that kills bacteria.  It's commonly prescribed for conditions like bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye), blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids), and other inflammatory eye conditions complicated by bacterial infection.  The specific infection being treated will determine the length of treatment, which is usually several days to a few weeks.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for usage.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, loteprednol etabonate/tobramycin can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Eye irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, or redness.
* **Blurred vision:** This usually resolves as the medication is absorbed.
* **Increased eye pressure (intraocular pressure):** This is more likely with prolonged use, particularly in individuals with pre-existing glaucoma. Regular monitoring of intraocular pressure may be necessary.
* **Eye pain:**  Seek medical attention if this occurs.
* **Headache**
* **Allergic reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions, such as skin rash, are possible.


**Less common, but more serious side effects include:**

* **Cataracts:** Long-term use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of cataracts.
* **Glaucoma:** Increased eye pressure can lead to glaucoma if left untreated.
* **Slow wound healing:** This can delay recovery from eye injuries or surgery.
* **Thinning of the cornea:**  This can lead to corneal perforation in severe cases.


**How it Works:**

* **Loteprednol etabonate:** This corticosteroid works by reducing inflammation in the eye. It does this by suppressing the activity of inflammatory cells and decreasing the release of inflammatory mediators. This helps to reduce swelling, redness, and pain.
* **Tobramycin:** This aminoglycoside antibiotic works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.  It's effective against a range of gram-negative bacteria commonly causing eye infections. The combination of the corticosteroid and antibiotic allows for effective management of both the infection and the inflammation associated with it.
