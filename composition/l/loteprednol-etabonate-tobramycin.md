# Loteprednol etabonate + Tobramycin
### Generic Name
Loteprednol etabonate + Tobramycin


### Usage

Loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension is a combination medication used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and other bacterial infections of the eye and surrounding structures.  Loteprednol etabonate is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and swelling. Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that fights bacterial infections.  The combination addresses both the inflammation and infection often present in these conditions.  While primarily used for bacterial conjunctivitis, it may also be prescribed for other bacterial infections of the eye, such as blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids) or keratitis (inflammation of the cornea),  *only when prescribed by a doctor and determined to be appropriate.*  It's crucial to understand that this medication is not effective against viral or fungal eye infections.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions are always provided by the prescribing physician and should be followed precisely.  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.  General guidelines are as follows, but **these are not a substitute for a doctor's orders:**

* **Adults and Children (6 years and older):** The typical dosage involves one or two drops in the affected eye(s) every 4 to 12 hours, as directed by the physician. The frequency depends on the severity of the infection and response to treatment.  
* **Children under 6 years:** This medication is generally not recommended for children under 6 years of age unless explicitly prescribed and monitored closely by a physician.
* **Administration:** Gently pull down the lower eyelid to create a pocket.  Place the prescribed number of drops into the pocket.  Close your eye gently and apply slight pressure to the inner corner of the eye (near the nose) for about 1 minute to minimize drainage into the tear duct and maximize absorption. Avoid touching the dropper tip to anything, including the eye.
* **Forms:** This medication is typically available as an ophthalmic suspension (liquid drops).


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye(s) upon application.
* Mild temporary blurring of vision.
* Eye irritation.


Less common but serious side effects:

* Increased eye pressure (glaucoma).  This is especially important to watch for in individuals with pre-existing glaucoma.
* Formation of cataracts.
* Eye infections.
* Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling).


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones,  discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Loteprednol etabonate reduces inflammation and swelling in the eye by suppressing the release of inflammatory mediators. This helps to alleviate the symptoms associated with eye infections.  Tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis, thus preventing the growth and reproduction of bacteria causing the infection.  The combination of these two medications provides effective treatment for bacterial eye infections by addressing both the infection and the associated inflammation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to loteprednol etabonate, tobramycin, or any of the inactive ingredients.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While less common with topical eye medications, itâ€™s crucial to inform your physician about all medications, including prescription, over-the-counter drugs, and herbal supplements, you are taking to assess any potential interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of this medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only used if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Consult your healthcare provider for advice.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid wearing contact lenses while using this medication.  Do not use this medication if you have a viral, fungal, or parasitic eye infection.  Always wash your hands thoroughly before applying the medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see improvement?**  A:  You might notice improvement within a few days, but complete resolution of the infection may take longer, often a week or two.  Consistent use is crucial.
* **Q: Can I use this medication if I have other eye conditions?**  A: Discuss any pre-existing eye conditions with your physician before using this medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A:  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.
