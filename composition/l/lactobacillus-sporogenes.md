# Lactobacillus Sporogenes

There is no bacterium officially recognized as *Lactobacillus sporogenes*.  The genus *Lactobacillus* contains species that are non-spore-forming.  The term "sporogenes" implies spore formation, which is not a characteristic of *Lactobacillus*.  There might be confusion with a different genus or an outdated/incorrect classification.

Therefore, I cannot provide details about a "generic Lactobacillus sporogenes". To provide helpful information, I need a correct bacterial species name.  If you can clarify the name or provide more context (e.g., where you encountered this name), I can offer more accurate information.
