# Levorphanol
### Generic Name
Levorphanol

### Usage
Levorphanol is a potent synthetic opioid analgesic primarily used for managing moderate to severe pain when other pain relief options are unsuitable.  It's also employed as premedication before anesthetic procedures to help reduce anxiety and pain during surgery.  The decision to use levorphanol should be based on a careful assessment of the patient's pain level and overall health.

### Dosage
**Important Note:** Levorphanol dosage is highly individualized and depends on factors like pain severity, age, weight, overall health, other medications being taken, and other individual factors.  A healthcare professional must determine the appropriate dosage.  

**Adults:**  Dosage varies depending on the route of administration (oral, intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SubQ), or intravenous (IV)) and whether the patient is opioid-naive (has never taken opioids before) or opioid-experienced.  Starting doses are generally low and are gradually increased as needed under careful medical supervision. The maximum daily dose should not be exceeded.


* **Pain Management (Opioid-naive):**
    * Oral: Starting dose 2 mg, repeated every 6-8 hours as needed. Maximum 6-12 mg/day.
    * IM/SubQ: 1 mg every 6-8 hours as needed. Maximum 3-8 mg/day.
    * IV: 1 mg slow IV every 3-6 hours as needed. Maximum 4-8 mg/day.

* **Pain Management (Opioid-experienced):** Dosages are typically higher than for opioid-naive patients, starting at 2-4mg orally every 6-8 hours as needed, or 1-2mg IM/SubQ every 6-8 hours. Maximum doses still apply and are carefully monitored by the physician.

* **Premedication for Anesthesia:**  1-2 mg IM/SubQ 60-90 minutes before surgery.

**Children:** Levorphanol is not recommended for children under 18 years old due to a lack of established safety and efficacy data.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with severe liver or kidney disease.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance in these cases.


### Side Effects
Levorphanol, like other opioids, can cause several side effects.  The frequency and severity vary depending on the individual and the dosage.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Itching (pruritus)
* Hypoventilation (decreased breathing rate)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Disturbances in consciousness or mood
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Constipation
* Vomiting
* Bradyarrhythmia (slow heart rate)
* Cardiac arrest
* Apnea (cessation of breathing)


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Levorphanol is a potent synthetic opioid agonist. This means it binds to opioid receptors (specifically mu-opioid receptors) in the brain and spinal cord.  By activating these receptors, levorphanol alters the way the body perceives and transmits pain signals, leading to pain relief. Its mechanism of action is similar to that of morphine.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Levorphanol is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to levorphanol or its components, significant respiratory depression, severe asthma (unless in a closely monitored setting with resuscitation equipment available), and gastrointestinal obstruction.

* **Drug Interactions:** Levorphanol can interact with various medications, including other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines),  certain antidepressants, and other opioids.  These interactions can increase the risk of respiratory depression, sedation, and other adverse effects.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, herbal supplements, and alcohol consumption.

* **Specific Populations:**  Levorphanol should be used cautiously in pregnant women (risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome), breastfeeding mothers (excretion in breast milk is unknown), elderly individuals, and patients with liver or kidney disease, respiratory problems, or heart conditions.

* **Addiction:** Levorphanol carries a risk of addiction, abuse, and misuse, like all opioid medications.  It should be used only as directed and under close medical supervision.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take levorphanol with alcohol?** A: No, combining levorphanol with alcohol can significantly increase the risk of severe respiratory depression, sedation, and even death due to additive CNS depressant effects.

* **Q: How should I store levorphanol?** A: Store levorphanol at room temperature, away from moisture and heat, and out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: What should I do if I take too much levorphanol?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention. Overdose can be fatal.  Naloxone is an antidote for opioid overdose and might be administered.

* **Q: Can I stop taking levorphanol suddenly?** A:  No.  Abruptly stopping levorphanol can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping this medication.
