# Levocetirizine + Ambroxol + Guaifenesin + Phenylephrine
### Generic Name
Levocetirizine + Ambroxol + Guaifenesin + Phenylephrine


### Usage

This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  It targets multiple symptoms simultaneously:

* **Levocetirizine:** This is an antihistamine that works to reduce allergic symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.  While not directly treating infection, it helps manage the allergic component often present in respiratory illnesses.

* **Ambroxol:** This is a mucolytic agent. It thins and loosens mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up and clear congestion.

* **Guaifenesin:** Also a mucolytic, guaifenesin helps to expel phlegm from the lungs. It works by increasing the amount of fluid in the airways, making the mucus less sticky and easier to cough out.

* **Phenylephrine:** This is a decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness and congestion.


The combined effect aims to provide comprehensive relief from the common symptoms of upper respiratory infections, including runny nose, sneezing, congestion, and cough with phlegm.  It's crucial to understand that this medication treats *symptoms*, not the underlying infection itself.  If the infection is bacterial, your healthcare provider may prescribe antibiotics.


### Dosage

Dosage information should always be obtained from your doctor or pharmacist.  The specific formulation and dosage will vary depending on the brand and the patient's age and health status.  Generic formulations often differ slightly in strength compared to brand name medications.

**General information (NOT a substitute for professional advice):** Dosage is typically based on the individual component amounts within the combination product.  There is no standard "universal" dosage across all brands, and the form (syrup, tablet, etc.) will affect the administration.  You should always follow the instructions provided with your specific medication.

* **Adults:** Dosage will typically be one dose (tablet or syrup) at a specified interval (e.g., once or twice daily).  Never exceed the recommended dose.

* **Children:** The dosage for children varies significantly depending on age and weight.  Never administer adult formulations to children.  Syrups are usually preferred for children, and dosages are carefully calculated based on the child's weight and age.

* **Oral Administration:**  Tablets should be swallowed whole with water. Syrups should be measured carefully using a measuring device provided with the medication, or as directed by your healthcare professional.

### How it Works

This combination medication works by targeting multiple aspects of upper respiratory symptoms:

* **Levocetirizine:** Blocks histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, reducing allergic symptoms.

* **Ambroxol and Guaifenesin:**  These mucolytics break down and thin mucus, making it easier to cough up.  They work through different mechanisms, offering a broader effect on mucus viscosity.

* **Phenylephrine:**  Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.


The combined effect provides symptomatic relief from various upper respiratory ailments.
