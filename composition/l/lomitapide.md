# Lomitapide
### Generic Name
Lomitapide

### Usage
Lomitapide is a medication used to lower cholesterol levels in adults with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).  HoFH is a rare, inherited condition where the body cannot effectively remove low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), often leading to extremely high cholesterol levels and an increased risk of premature heart disease. Lomitapide is used *in addition to* other cholesterol-lowering treatments, such as a low-fat diet and LDL apheresis (a procedure to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood), to further reduce LDL-C, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apo B), and non-HDL cholesterol.  It's crucial to understand that Lomitapide is not a standalone treatment for HoFH but a crucial adjunct therapy.


### Dosage
The dosage of Lomitapide is highly individualized and carefully titrated based on the patient's response and tolerance. It is generally administered orally as a capsule.

* **Adults with HoFH:**  Treatment begins with a low dose (5 mg once daily). After at least two weeks, the doctor may increase the dose to 10 mg once daily, and then potentially further to 20 mg, 40 mg, and finally a maximum of 60 mg once daily.  These increases are made gradually at intervals of at least four weeks, always under close medical supervision.  A low-fat diet (less than 20% of daily calories from fat) is essential.

* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Lomitapide have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  For mild hepatic impairment, the maximum dose is 40 mg daily.  Moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment or active liver disease contraindicates Lomitapide use.  For patients with mild-to-severe renal impairment not on dialysis, dosage adjustments aren't specified, but increased exposure is possible. For those with end-stage renal disease on dialysis, the maximum dose is 40 mg daily.  Dosage adjustments are also needed when co-administering Lomitapide with certain medications, including some CYP3A4 inhibitors (like certain statins and other drugs) and oral contraceptives; consult a physician for specific instructions in these situations.  Regular monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is crucial throughout treatment.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Chest pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Weight loss
* Abdominal discomfort
* Abdominal distension
* Constipation
* Flatulence
* Gastroenteritis
* Influenza
* Back pain
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nasal passages)
* Pharyngolaryngeal pain (sore throat)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity), including increased liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and liver steatosis (fatty liver).  This is a significant risk and necessitates close monitoring.
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Alopecia (hair loss)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those related to the liver or severe gastrointestinal issues, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Lomitapide inhibits microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP).  MTP is a protein in the liver and intestines that plays a crucial role in assembling very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, which transport lipids (fats) in the blood. By inhibiting MTP, Lomitapide reduces the production of these lipoproteins, leading to a decrease in LDL cholesterol and other lipids in the bloodstream.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to Lomitapide or its components.
* Significant, chronic bowel disease (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease).
* Concomitant use of simvastatin at doses greater than 20 mg/day (except in specific, pre-approved cases).
* Moderate or severe hepatic impairment or active liver disease.
* Pregnancy.
* Galactose intolerance, congenital lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption.

**Warnings:**

* **Hepatotoxicity:** Lomitapide carries a significant risk of liver damage. Regular monitoring of liver function is mandatory.  Dose adjustments or discontinuation may be necessary based on liver enzyme levels.
* **Gastrointestinal effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, and other gastrointestinal issues are common.
* **Drug interactions:** Lomitapide interacts with several medications, particularly those metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes.  Consult your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy:** Lomitapide is contraindicated during pregnancy; effective contraception is essential.
* **Breastfeeding:** Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking Lomitapide.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Lomitapide with food?** A:  No, Lomitapide should be taken with water at least two hours after the evening meal to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Q: How is Lomitapide stored?** A: Store Lomitapide at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **Q: Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Lomitapide?** A: No, avoid grapefruit juice, as it can increase Lomitapide levels in the blood.
* **Q:  What if I experience liver problems?** A: Liver problems are a serious side effect of Lomitapide. Contact your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain, or fatigue.  Regular monitoring of liver function is crucial during treatment.
