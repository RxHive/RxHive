# Lisuride
### Generic Name
Lisuride

### Usage
Lisuride, an ergot derivative and dopamine agonist, is primarily used to treat several conditions:

* **Hyperprolactinemia:**  This refers to an excess of prolactin, a hormone primarily involved in milk production.  Lisuride helps lower prolactin levels, thereby treating associated disorders like galactorrhea (abnormal milk production), amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), and infertility. It's also used in managing prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas (tumors).

* **Acromegaly:** This is a hormonal disorder characterized by excessive growth hormone production. Lisuride helps control growth hormone levels and manage the symptoms of acromegaly.

* **Parkinsonism:** Lisuride is employed in treating the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease, postencephalitic parkinsonism, and other forms of parkinsonism (excluding drug-induced parkinsonism). It works by stimulating dopamine receptors in the brain.

* **Lactation Inhibition:** Lisuride can be used to suppress lactation (milk production) after childbirth or abortion.

While historically used in low doses to prevent migraine attacks, this application is less common now.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  The information below is for general understanding only and should not be interpreted as a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Adult Dosage (Oral):**

* **Hyperprolactinemia & Acromegaly:**  Typically starts with 0.1mg once daily in the evening.  The dose may be gradually increased to 0.1mg twice or thrice daily, based on clinical response and prolactin or growth hormone levels. The maximum daily dose is usually 2mg, divided into several administrations.

* **Lactation Inhibition:** Usually 0.2mg two to three times daily for 14 days, starting within 24 hours of delivery or abortion.  Treatment may extend for another 7 days if milk secretion recurs.

* **Parkinsonism:**  Initiation is typically 0.1mg once daily in the evening, with gradual increases (0.1mg at weekly intervals) depending on response and tolerance. The usual daily dose ranges from 0.6mg to 2mg, divided into 3-4 administrations.  If used concurrently with levodopa, the levodopa dose may need adjustment.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised, and the lowest possible dose should be used, gradually titrating upwards as tolerated.  Patients with renal impairment may be more sensitive to Lisuride.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Information on pediatric dosage is not readily available in standard sources;  it should only be used in children under strict medical supervision.

**Important:**  The examples provided are simplified representations; your physician will tailor your dosage based on your individual circumstances.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Frequency varies depending on the source):**

* Nervous System: Drowsiness, anxiety, headache, vertigo, hallucinations, confusion, insomnia, nightmares, dizziness,  dystonia, myoclonus.
* Cardiovascular: Orthostatic hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing), cold extremities, peripheral edema, palpitations, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), increased blood pressure.
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, decreased appetite, constipation, xerostomia (dry mouth), vomiting, abdominal distress, anorexia.
* Dermatologic: Diaphoresis (excessive sweating), allergic skin reactions.
* Other: Dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements), dyspnea (shortness of breath).


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs), pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring), retroperitoneal fibrosis (scarring around the kidneys), cardiac fibrosis (scarring of heart tissue), pericardial effusion/pericarditis (fluid around the heart), increased libido, weight gain, pathological gambling, sudden onset of sleep, paranoid ideation, disorientation.


**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Lisuride is a dopamine agonist, meaning it mimics the effects of dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for motor control and hormone regulation.  By activating dopamine receptors in the brain, it improves motor function in Parkinsonism.  It also inhibits prolactin secretion by acting on dopamine receptors in the pituitary gland, thus treating hyperprolactinemia.  Lisuride also exhibits anti-serotonin and antihistaminic properties, although their exact roles in its therapeutic effects are not fully elucidated.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Lisuride is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or ergot alkaloids, coronary insufficiency, severe peripheral artery disorders, and concomitant use with phenylpropanolamine.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Lisuride may interact negatively with neuroleptics (antipsychotics), dopamine antagonists, CNS depressants (including alcohol), alpha-sympathomimetics, other ergot alkaloids, and anticholinergic antiparkinsonian drugs.  Consult your doctor about any medications you are currently taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Lisuride use during pregnancy is generally avoided due to unknown safety. It's excreted in breast milk, making breastfeeding inadvisable during treatment.

* **Other Precautions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, a history of psychosis, renal or hepatic impairment.  Avoid tasks requiring alertness (e.g., driving) if experiencing drowsiness.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Lisuride suddenly?** A: No,  always consult your doctor before stopping Lisuride.  Sudden cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: How should I store Lisuride?** A: Store it as directed on the packaging, usually in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is Lisuride addictive?** A:  While not physically addictive in the same way as opiates,  it can cause dependence,  meaning that the body adapts to its effects, making it difficult to stop taking it without experiencing withdrawal.  Discontinuation must be done under medical supervision.

* **Q: Are there any long-term risks associated with Lisuride?** A: Long-term use is associated with a risk of fibrosis (scarring) in various organs (lungs, heart, kidneys).  Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider is crucial.
