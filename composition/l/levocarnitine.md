# Levocarnitine
### Generic Name
Levocarnitine

### Usage
Levocarnitine is primarily used to treat carnitine deficiency, a condition where the body doesn't have enough carnitine, a crucial molecule for transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria (the cell's energy powerhouses) for energy production.  This deficiency can be primary (inherited) or secondary (acquired due to other medical conditions or treatments like dialysis). Levocarnitine is also used to manage secondary carnitine deficiency associated with various conditions impacting carnitine metabolism or transport.  It's important to note that some uses, like treating acute valproic acid toxicity, are considered off-label, meaning they are not officially approved but may be used by healthcare professionals based on clinical judgment.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the reason for treatment and the route of administration (oral or intravenous).

* **Carnitine Deficiency (Primary or Secondary):** Oral: 1000 mg/day initially, divided into doses every 3-4 hours, with potential titration up to 3000 mg/day depending on response and tolerance. Intravenous: 50 mg/kg/day in divided doses, with higher doses possibly needed in severe cases (up to 300 mg/kg/day).  For patients on dialysis, intravenous doses of 10-20 mg/kg (dry body weight) after each dialysis session are typical.  Careful monitoring and dose adjustments are crucial.

* **Acute Valproic Acid Toxicity (Off-Label):** Intravenous:  Starts with 100 mg/kg as an IV bolus, followed by 50 mg/kg every 8 hours (up to a maximum of 3000mg) until ammonia levels fall and clinical improvement is observed.  This often requires several days of treatment.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage in children is usually calculated based on weight (mg/kg/day).  It varies significantly depending on the underlying condition and whether it's given orally or intravenously.  Always follow a doctor's precise instructions.  Ranges are similar to adults, but maximum daily doses are usually lower for children. For example, in primary carnitine deficiency, initial oral doses are 50 mg/kg/day, potentially increasing to 100 mg/kg/day. For intravenous administration in severe cases, loading doses of 50mg/kg may be used, followed by divided doses over 24 hours. For prevention of cyclic vomiting syndrome, it might be 50-100mg/kg/day, divided into two or three doses per day.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are usually recommended for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment based on the manufacturer's information, although caution is warranted, especially in renal issues as oral carnitine hasn't been fully tested in individuals with kidney insufficiency.

### Side Effects

**Common:**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea/Vomiting
* Body odor (a less common but notable side effect)

**Less Common but Serious:**

* Hypertension
* Chest pain
* Tachycardia (rapid heartbeat)
* Palpitations
* Allergic reactions (rash, urticaria, facial edema, anaphylaxis, laryngeal edema, bronchospasm)
* Seizures
* Liver problems
* Kidney problems
* Anemia

If any side effects occur, it is essential to contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Levocarnitine facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, the energy-producing components within cells. By doing so, it ensures these fatty acids can be broken down to produce energy. This process is crucial for various metabolic functions throughout the body.  In carnitine deficiency, this transport is impaired, leading to reduced energy production and the accumulation of harmful substances. Levocarnitine supplements the body's carnitine levels, allowing for normal fatty acid metabolism and improved energy production.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Levocarnitine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to it or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Levocarnitine may interact with Vitamin K antagonists, potentially impacting their effectiveness.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While categorized as pregnancy category B (suggesting low risk), the potential teratogenic effects of carnitine should be considered.  Levocarnitine is excreted in breast milk, so the potential benefits must be weighed against potential infant exposure.
* **Other Precautions:** Use with caution in individuals with seizure disorders or those at risk of seizures.  Close monitoring is needed, especially when using intravenous formulations.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store levocarnitine?** A: Store levocarnitine as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I take levocarnitine with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor of all other medications and supplements you're taking to avoid potential interactions, particularly vitamin K antagonists.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double up on doses.

* **Q: Is levocarnitine safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term safety depends on individual health, the reason for use, and appropriate monitoring by a healthcare provider.

* **Q:  What if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.
