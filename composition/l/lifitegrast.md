# Lifitegrast
### Generic Name
Lifitegrast

### Usage
Lifitegrast is primarily used to treat the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease (DED).  It's an ophthalmic solution (eye drops) designed to alleviate the discomfort and visual disturbances associated with this condition.  Currently, it does not have any other significant approved uses.

### Dosage
**Dry Eye Disease:**

* **Adults and Adolescents (â‰¥17 years):** The recommended dosage is one drop of 5% lifitegrast ophthalmic solution in each affected eye twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart).  Each dose should be administered using a separate single-use container, which should be discarded immediately after use.

* **Children (<17 years):** The safety and efficacy of lifitegrast have not been established in children under 17 years of age.  Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this age group.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Decreased visual acuity (blurred vision)
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Application-site irritation (eye irritation, burning, stinging)


**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Sinusitis
* Blurred vision
* Conjunctival hyperemia (redness of the eye)
* Eye discharge
* Eye discomfort
* Eye itching (pruritus)
* Increased lacrimation (watering eyes)


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (post-marketing reports):**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic conjunctivitis, allergic dermatitis, anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pharyngeal edema, respiratory distress, swollen tongue, urticaria)
* Skin rash
* Eye swelling

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious or unusual, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Lifitegrast works by targeting lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), a protein found on the surface of white blood cells (leukocytes). In dry eye disease, there's often an overproduction of inflammatory substances in the eye's surface tissues.  Lifitegrast binds to LFA-1, preventing it from interacting with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). This interaction is crucial for immune cell activation and migration to the affected area. By blocking this interaction, lifitegrast helps to reduce inflammation and improve the symptoms of dry eye disease.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Lifitegrast is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity to lifitegrast or any component of the formulation.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of lifitegrast during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Healthcare providers should carefully weigh the benefits of treatment against potential risks.  If used during pregnancy, the minimum effective dose should be considered, along with punctal occlusion (blocking tear drainage) to minimize fetal exposure. The excretion of lifitegrast in breast milk is unknown.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Blurred vision is a possible side effect.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if vision is affected.
* **Contact Lenses:** Remove contact lenses before administering lifitegrast and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.
* **Application:** Avoid touching the tip of the single-use container to the eye or any other surface to prevent contamination.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for lifitegrast to work?** A: The onset of effect varies, but many patients experience improvement in their symptoms within a few weeks of starting treatment.

* **Q: Can I use lifitegrast with other eye drops?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist before using lifitegrast with other eye medications to avoid potential interactions.  Allow at least 5-10 minutes between different eye drops.

* **Q: How should I store lifitegrast?** A: Store the single-use containers at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Discard any unused containers.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Administer the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.


* **Q: Is lifitegrast safe for long-term use?** A: The long-term safety of lifitegrast is still being assessed, but it is generally well-tolerated in clinical trials. Discuss long-term use with your physician.
