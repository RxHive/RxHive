# Loratadine + Pseudoephedrine
### Generic Name
Loratadine + Pseudoephedrine

### Usage

Loratadine + Pseudoephedrine is a combination medication used to relieve symptoms of the common cold or other upper respiratory allergies.  It's designed to tackle both the allergic reactions and the congestion often associated with these conditions.

Loratadine, an antihistamine, works to reduce allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and hives.  Pseudoephedrine, a decongestant, targets nasal and sinus congestion by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages.  This combination medication provides dual action, effectively addressing both the allergic and congestion components of upper respiratory illnesses.  It's important to note that this medication primarily treats symptoms and doesn't cure the underlying infection.

### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary depending on the specific brand and formulation of Loratadine + Pseudoephedrine.  Always follow the directions provided on your prescription or over-the-counter packaging.  Generally, for adults, the typical dose is one tablet or capsule every 12 hours, as needed.  Children's dosages are significantly lower and are usually determined by weight and age; therefore, always consult a pediatrician or pharmacist for appropriate dosing for children.  Never exceed the recommended dosage.


There is no IV formulation of Loratadine + Pseudoephedrine.  It's typically administered orally in tablet or capsule form.

### How it Works

Loratadine blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking histamine, it reduces the symptoms associated with allergies. Pseudoephedrine works by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages. This reduces swelling and congestion, allowing for easier breathing.  The combined action of these two ingredients provides comprehensive relief from cold and allergy symptoms.
