# Loratadine + Pseudoephedrine

**Generic Name:** Loratadine and Pseudoephedrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of allergy and the common cold.  Loratadine is an antihistamine that reduces symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy/watery eyes, and itching. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving nasal congestion.  It's typically used for temporary relief of these symptoms.  It's important to note that this combination is often available over-the-counter (OTC), but always follow the directions on the label and consult a doctor or pharmacist if you have concerns.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is more likely with loratadine.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be caused by either ingredient.
* **Headache:** A relatively common side effect.
* **Nausea:** Less common.
* **Dry mouth:**  A frequent side effect, particularly with pseudoephedrine.
* **Insomnia:** More likely with pseudoephedrine, especially if taken later in the day.
* **Increased blood pressure and heart rate:** More likely with pseudoephedrine, particularly in individuals with pre-existing hypertension.
* **Nervousness or anxiety:** More likely with pseudoephedrine.

Serious side effects are less common but should be reported to a doctor immediately.  These can include allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), fast or irregular heartbeat, and chest pain.


**How it Works:**

* **Loratadine:** This antihistamine works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  By blocking histamine, it reduces many of the allergic symptoms.

* **Pseudoephedrine:** This decongestant is a sympathomimetic amine. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages. This reduces swelling and congestion, allowing easier breathing.
