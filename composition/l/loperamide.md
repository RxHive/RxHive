# Loperamide
### Generic Name
Loperamide

### Usage
Loperamide is primarily used to treat diarrhea, including acute diarrhea (sudden onset), traveler's diarrhea, and chronic diarrhea (long-lasting).  While not its primary indication, it's sometimes used off-label to manage diarrhea caused by cancer treatments (like chemotherapy) or to prevent diarrhea associated with certain medications.  It's crucial to understand that loperamide only treats the symptom of diarrhea; it does *not* treat the underlying cause of the diarrhea.  If the cause is an infection, appropriate treatment for the infection is necessary.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Oral):**

* **Acute Diarrhea:**  The usual starting dose is 4 mg, followed by 2 mg after each loose stool. The maximum daily dose is 16 mg.
* **Chronic Diarrhea:**  Begin with 4 mg, followed by 2 mg after each loose stool. The maximum daily dose is 16 mg.  The maintenance dose should be the lowest effective dose to control symptoms, typically ranging from 4-8 mg daily, either as a single dose or in divided doses. If symptoms don't improve after 10 days of taking 16 mg/day, loperamide alone is unlikely to help, and other management strategies should be considered.
* **Traveler's Diarrhea:**  Take 4 mg after the first loose stool, then 2 mg after each subsequent loose stool. The maximum daily dose is 16 mg. Treatment should not last longer than 48 hours.
* **Cancer Treatment-Induced Diarrhea (Off-Label):** Dosage varies greatly depending on the severity and individual response, often starting with 4 mg followed by 2 mg every 2-4 hours or after each loose stool. Doses above 16 mg/day may not be more effective.
* **Neratinib-Induced Diarrhea Prophylaxis (Off-Label):** A specific regimen is typically prescribed by the oncologist, often involving a higher initial dose and tapering down as needed.

**Pediatric Dosage (Oral):**  Dosage is carefully adjusted based on age and weight, and **should always be determined by a doctor.** The following is for informational purposes only and does not replace medical advice. Dosages generally start lower than adult doses and increase gradually.   The maximum daily dose is also lower than the adult maximum.  Loperamide is contraindicated in children under 2 years old.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are typically needed for patients with kidney problems. However, those with liver problems should use loperamide with extreme caution and close monitoring due to the potential for increased side effects.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Constipation
* Abdominal cramps
* Nausea

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Less than 1%, reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports):**

* Severe constipation
* Paralytic ileus (bowel obstruction)
* Toxic megacolon (a serious complication affecting the colon)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives, swelling)
*  Slowed heart rate
* Torsades de pointes (a type of abnormal heart rhythm)

**Important:** Any severe or concerning side effects should prompt immediate consultation with a healthcare professional.  High doses of loperamide can cause serious cardiac problems, including potentially fatal arrhythmias.

### How it Works
Loperamide works by slowing down the movement of the intestines. It does this by binding to opioid receptors in the gut wall. By slowing intestinal motility, loperamide allows more time for water and electrolytes to be absorbed back into the body, resulting in firmer stools and less frequent bowel movements.  Importantly, this action is localized to the gut; it does not cross the blood-brain barrier to the same extent as other opioid medications, significantly reducing the risk of central nervous system effects at standard dosages.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Loperamide should not be used in individuals with hypersensitivity to it, abdominal pain without diarrhea, acute dysentery, acute ulcerative colitis, bacterial enterocolitis (caused by *Salmonella*, *Shigella*, and *Campylobacter*), pseudomembranous colitis associated with antibiotic use, or children under 2 years of age.
* **Interactions:** Loperamide's levels in the blood can be increased by certain medications that inhibit P-glycoprotein (e.g., quinidine, ritonavir).  It can also affect the effectiveness of some other medications (such as saquinavir).  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Warnings:** High doses of loperamide can lead to serious cardiac side effects, even death.  Use with extreme caution in patients with liver impairment. Older adults and children are particularly vulnerable to dehydration from diarrhea, so careful monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance is essential. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using loperamide.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I take loperamide?** A:  Generally, loperamide should only be used for a short period, usually no more than 2 days for acute diarrhea. For chronic diarrhea, ongoing medical management is necessary.

* **Q: Can I take loperamide with other medications?** A: It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking. Certain medications can interact with loperamide, potentially increasing the risk of side effects.

* **Q: What should I do if my diarrhea worsens or doesn't improve?** A: If your diarrhea worsens, doesn't improve after a couple of days, or is accompanied by other concerning symptoms like fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stools, seek medical attention immediately.

* **Q: How should I store loperamide?** A: Store loperamide as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Is loperamide safe for everyone?** A: No, loperamide is contraindicated for certain groups (see Precautions). It's essential to consult your doctor before using it, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions.
