# Lubiprostone

**Generic Name:** Lubiprostone

**Usage:**

Lubiprostone is a medication used to treat chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in adults and adolescents (12 years and older).  It's prescribed when changes in diet and lifestyle haven't been sufficient to relieve symptoms.

**Side Effects:**

The most common side effects of lubiprostone are gastrointestinal in nature and generally mild to moderate.  These include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea (though this is often a desired effect in treating constipation)
* Headache
* Abdominal pain or cramps

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Severe abdominal pain
* Dehydration (due to diarrhea)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)


**How it Works:**

Lubiprostone is a chloride channel activator.  It works by locally increasing chloride-rich intestinal fluid secretion in the intestines. This increases intestinal motility (movement) and softens stool, making bowel movements easier.  Importantly, it primarily acts in the intestine and doesn't significantly affect other parts of the body, minimizing systemic side effects.
