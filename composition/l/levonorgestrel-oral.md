# Levonorgestrel (Oral)
### Generic Name
Levonorgestrel (Oral)

### Usage
Levonorgestrel is primarily used as emergency contraception. This means it's taken after unprotected sex or suspected contraceptive failure to prevent pregnancy.  It's not intended for regular, ongoing birth control.

### Dosage
**Emergency Contraception (Females):**

* **Two-dose regimen:** One 0.75-mg tablet should be taken as soon as possible, ideally within 72 hours (3 days) of unprotected sex. A second 0.75-mg tablet is taken 12 hours after the first.
* **Single-dose regimen:** One 1.5-mg tablet should be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours of unprotected sex.

Levonorgestrel can be used at any point in the menstrual cycle.  While most effective within 72 hours, it retains some effectiveness up to 5 days after unprotected sex.  If vomiting occurs within two hours of taking a dose, it's advisable to contact a healthcare provider. The second dose in the two-dose regimen remains effective if taken between 12 and 24 hours after the first dose.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Not applicable before menarche (the onset of menstruation).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are specified by manufacturers for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

* **Common (greater than 10%):** Fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and hypermenorrhea (heavy menstrual bleeding).
* **Less Common (1-10%):** Dizziness, headache, suppressed menstruation, breast tenderness.
* **Less Frequent but Reported:** Dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation), irregular menses, oligomenorrhea (infrequent menstruation), pelvic pain, and vomiting.

If you experience any concerning side effects, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Levonorgestrel is a progestin that works in several ways to prevent pregnancy. It primarily thickens cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the egg. It may also delay or inhibit ovulation (the release of an egg) and may interfere with the implantation of a fertilized egg. However, Levonorgestrel is not effective once implantation has begun.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Known or suspected pregnancy, hypersensitivity to levonorgestrel or any component of the formulation, and undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.
* **Increased Risk:** Levonorgestrel may increase the risk of bleeding irregularities (spotting), carbohydrate intolerance, chloasma (skin discoloration), depression, ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus), thromboembolism (blood clots), breast cancer, and hepatic adenomas (liver tumors).
* **Drug Interactions:** Levonorgestrel can interact with various medications.  Consult a healthcare provider about potential interactions before taking levonorgestrel if you are on other medications.
* **Caution:** Use cautiously in women with diabetes.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Levonorgestrel is classified as Category X for pregnancy (contraindicated), meaning it's harmful to a developing fetus. It is excreted in breast milk, but can be used by breastfeeding mothers for emergency contraception.

### FAQs
