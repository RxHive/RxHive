* **Cystitis and urinary tract infections (UTIs):** This includes both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs, affecting the bladder and other urinary tract parts.
* **Prostatitis:**  Lomefloxacin targets bacterial infections of the prostate gland.
* **Salmonella enteric fever and gastroenteritis:** It's effective against bacterial infections caused by Salmonella, leading to typhoid fever and gastrointestinal issues.
* **Shigellosis:** Lomefloxacin combats bacterial dysentery caused by Shigella bacteria.
* **Surgical prophylaxis:** Lomefloxacin can be used before certain surgical procedures (transurethral and transrectal) to prevent post-operative infections.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the infection being treated and the patient's renal function.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  The information below is for general understanding only and should not substitute professional medical advice.

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Lomefloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. These enzymes are crucial for DNA replication and repair in bacteria. By inhibiting these enzymes, Lomefloxacin prevents bacterial DNA replication, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Lomefloxacin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones or any of its components.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Lomefloxacin use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally avoided due to potential risks.
* **Children:**  Lomefloxacin is not approved for use in children.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are often necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function.
* **Seizures:** Lomefloxacin should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or those at risk of seizures.
* **Tendon Problems:**  There is a risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture, particularly in older adults.  
* **Myasthenia Gravis:** Lomefloxacin may worsen symptoms in patients with myasthenia gravis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Lomefloxacin can interact with various medications, including antacids, sucralfate, theophylline, cimetidine, cyclosporine, probenecid and warfarin. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Lomefloxacin with antacids?**  A: It's best to avoid taking Lomefloxacin with antacids, especially those containing magnesium or aluminum, as they can reduce its absorption.
* **Q: How should I store Lomefloxacin?** A: Store Lomefloxacin as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Lomefloxacin?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist; alcohol may interact negatively with the medication.
