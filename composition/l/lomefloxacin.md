# Lomefloxacin

**Generic Name:** Lomefloxacin

**Usage:** Lomefloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections.  Its specific uses vary depending on the formulation and country of approval, but it's often prescribed for infections of the:

* Respiratory tract (e.g., pneumonia, bronchitis)
* Urinary tract (e.g., cystitis, pyelonephritis)
* Skin and soft tissues
* Bones and joints
* Certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs)


**Important Note:**  Lomefloxacin is not widely available globally and its use is generally considered limited due to the availability of safer and more effective alternatives.  The specific uses and availability should be confirmed with a healthcare professional and by checking local regulations and guidelines.  Overuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance.

**Side Effects:**  Like other fluoroquinolones, lomefloxacin can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others serious.  These include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, insomnia.
* **Less Common:**  Rash, itching, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight),  vaginal yeast infection.
* **Serious (requiring immediate medical attention):**  Tendinitis (inflammation of tendons), tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage), seizures,  liver damage,  severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), prolonged QT interval (heart rhythm abnormality).


**How it Works:** Lomefloxacin is a bacteriocidal antibiotic.  This means it kills bacteria by interfering with their DNA replication and repair mechanisms.  Specifically, it inhibits the bacterial enzyme topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are essential for bacterial DNA replication and cell division.  This ultimately leads to bacterial cell death.
