# Liquid Paraffin + White Soft Paraffin

**Generic Name:** Liquid Paraffin + White Soft Paraffin (This is actually a combination of two ingredients, not a single generic name.  Individual generic names would be Paraffinum Liquidum and Paraffinum Molle Album, respectively)

**Usage:**

* **Constipation relief:** This combination is primarily used as a laxative to relieve constipation.  Liquid paraffin lubricates the stool, making it easier to pass, while white soft paraffin adds bulk to the stool.
* **Skin moisturizer:**  White soft paraffin is an emollient, meaning it softens and moisturizes the skin. It's often used in creams and ointments to help soothe dry or irritated skin.  Liquid paraffin, while less common in skincare, can also contribute to moisturizing effects in some formulations.
* **Other uses (less common):**  It may be used as a protective barrier for skin, or in certain medical devices.


**Side Effects:**

* **Anal leakage:**  Liquid paraffin can leak from the anus, potentially staining underwear.
* **Abdominal cramping or discomfort:** Some people experience mild abdominal cramping or discomfort after using liquid paraffin.
* **Vitamin deficiencies (long-term use):**  Long-term use of liquid paraffin can interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).
* **Pneumonitis (rare but serious):** Aspiration of liquid paraffin into the lungs can cause a serious inflammatory condition called lipoid pneumonia. This is more likely to occur if the product is not used correctly.
* **Allergic reactions (rare):** Although rare, allergic reactions such as skin rashes are possible.


**How it Works:**

* **Liquid Paraffin:** Acts as a stool softener by lubricating the stool and the intestinal walls, making it easier for the stool to pass through the intestines. It doesn't stimulate bowel movements directly.
* **White Soft Paraffin:** Adds bulk to the stool, contributing to easier bowel movements. It is primarily used for its emollient properties in skin preparations.
