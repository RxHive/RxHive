# L-Ornithine L-Aspartate + Pancreatin

**Generic Name:** L-Ornithine L-Aspartate + Pancreatin


**Usage:**

This combination is primarily used to support liver function and aid in digestion.  L-Ornithine L-Aspartate (LOLA) is believed to help the liver process ammonia, a byproduct of protein metabolism.  Elevated ammonia levels can be detrimental, especially in individuals with liver disease. Pancreatin is a pancreatic enzyme supplement that contains lipase, amylase, and protease. These enzymes help digest fats, carbohydrates, and proteins, respectively.  Therefore, the combination is sometimes used in conditions involving impaired liver function and/or digestive insufficiency, such as:

* **Hyperammonemia (elevated blood ammonia levels):**  LOLA may help reduce ammonia levels.
* **Hepatic encephalopathy:** A brain disorder caused by severe liver disease.  The combination may offer some supportive benefits.
* **Chronic pancreatitis:**  Pancreatin can supplement the body's insufficient production of digestive enzymes.
* **Cystic fibrosis:** This condition often involves pancreatic insufficiency, requiring enzyme supplementation.
* **Post-surgical recovery (following gastrointestinal surgery):**  Can help with digestion and nutrient absorption.


**It's crucial to note:** This combination is *not* a cure for liver disease or digestive disorders.  It is a supportive therapy, and its effectiveness varies depending on the individual and the underlying condition.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using this combination, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating.  These are more likely with Pancreatin, especially if taken in high doses.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but possible, including rash, itching, swelling.
* **Elevated uric acid levels:**  In some cases.


**How it Works:**

* **L-Ornithine L-Aspartate (LOLA):**  This combination of amino acids is believed to stimulate the urea cycle in the liver. The urea cycle is a crucial pathway for removing ammonia from the blood.  By enhancing this process, LOLA may help lower ammonia levels.  The exact mechanisms are still under investigation.

* **Pancreatin:** This enzyme supplement provides lipase, amylase, and protease enzymes that aid in the digestion of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins, respectively.  This can be beneficial when the pancreas is unable to produce sufficient quantities of these enzymes.


**FAQs:**

* **Is this combination safe for everyone?** No.  Individuals with certain medical conditions (e.g., severe liver disease, pancreatitis, kidney problems) should consult their doctor before use. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also seek medical advice.

* **How should I take this combination?**  Dosage varies depending on the condition and individual needs. Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by your healthcare provider.

* **Can I take this with other medications?**  It's important to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking to avoid potential drug interactions.

* **What if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **When should I see a doctor?** Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe side effects, such as severe allergic reactions or persistent gastrointestinal problems.
