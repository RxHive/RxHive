# L-Ornithine L-Aspartate + Pancreatin
### Generic Name
L-Ornithine L-Aspartate + Pancreatin

**Note:**  L-Ornithine L-Aspartate + Pancreatin is a combination medication.  Information provided below reflects the combined effects and should not be considered solely applicable to either component in isolation.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for specific information on this combination.


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to support liver function and aid in digestion.  L-Ornithine L-Aspartate is believed to help reduce ammonia levels in the blood, a byproduct of protein metabolism that can build up in individuals with liver dysfunction.  Pancreatin supplements the body's production of pancreatic enzymes, crucial for the digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Therefore, this combination is often used in cases of:

* **Hyperammonemia:** Elevated levels of ammonia in the blood, often associated with liver disease.  It's important to note that this is not a primary treatment for liver disease but rather a supportive therapy to manage a specific symptom.
* **Chronic Pancreatitis:**  A condition where the pancreas is inflamed, resulting in insufficient enzyme production. This combination can help improve digestion and nutrient absorption in such cases.
* **Cystic Fibrosis:** This genetic disorder affects multiple organs, including the pancreas, leading to digestive issues.  The medication may assist in managing these digestive problems.
* **Other digestive disorders:** Conditions causing insufficient pancreatic enzyme production can benefit from this combination therapy, aiding in nutrient absorption and reducing symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and steatorrhea (fatty stools).


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the individual's condition, age, and response to the medication.  It's crucial to follow the prescription provided by a healthcare professional.  There is no standard dosage information for this combination applicable to everyone. The doctor will determine the appropriate dosage of both L-Ornithine L-Aspartate and Pancreatin based on a comprehensive assessment.  Dosage forms may include tablets or capsules. Oral administration is typical.  Intravenous administration is not typical for this combination.  Always refer to your physician or pharmacist for precise instructions.  Children's dosages will always be determined by a medical professional.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal discomfort
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas â€“ requires immediate medical attention)
* Hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels)


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

L-Ornithine L-Aspartate facilitates the conversion of ammonia to urea in the liver. Urea is less toxic than ammonia and is easily excreted by the kidneys. This helps reduce the levels of ammonia in the bloodstream, alleviating the symptoms associated with hyperammonemia.  Pancreatin provides supplemental pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase, and protease) which aid in the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the digestive tract, improving nutrient absorption and alleviating digestive symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This combination should not be used by individuals with known allergies to either L-Ornithine L-Aspartate or any component of Pancreatin.  Specific contraindications may vary depending on the individual's medical history.
* **Drug Interactions:** Interactions with other medications are possible. It's essential to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your physician before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The safety and efficacy of this combination in these groups have not been fully established.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage adjustment may be necessary for elderly individuals due to potential changes in liver and kidney function.  Careful monitoring is crucial.
* **Children:**  Children should only use this medication under strict medical supervision and with a dosage specifically prescribed by a pediatrician.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store as directed on the product label, usually in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: Can I take this medication with food?** A:  Generally, it is recommended to take this with food, particularly the Pancreatin component, to aid in digestion and minimize stomach upset.
* **Q: How long will it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see results varies depending on the individual and the condition being treated.  This is not a quick fix for underlying health conditions.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for advice on how to proceed.
* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication abruptly?** A: No, stopping this medication abruptly may cause withdrawal symptoms or worsening of the underlying condition.  Always consult your doctor before stopping treatment.
