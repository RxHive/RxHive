# Lonafarnib
### Generic Name
Lonafarnib

### Usage
Lonafarnib is a medication primarily used to reduce the risk of mortality in children and adults (aged ≥12 months with a body surface area of ≥0.39 m²) with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS).  It's also used to treat processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies.  These are rare genetic disorders characterized by premature aging, and Lonafarnib's effectiveness is specifically linked to the presence of progerin or progerin-like proteins resulting from certain <i>LMNA</i> or <i>ZMPSTE24</i> gene mutations.  Importantly, Lonafarnib is not effective in other forms of progeroid syndromes or those not associated with these specific protein accumulations.

### Dosage

Lonafarnib dosage is complex and determined by body surface area (BSA). It's crucial to follow the precise instructions provided by a healthcare professional. Dosing is typically administered orally, twice daily (BID), with food.  There are two approaches to calculating the dose:

**BSA-directed dosing:**  This method starts with an initial dose of 115 mg/m²/dose BID for four months, followed by an increase to 150 mg/m²/dose BID.  The total daily dose is rounded to the nearest 25 mg increment.

**BSA fixed-dose:** This method uses pre-defined dose ranges based on BSA.  Specific dose ranges are given for both the initial and increased doses, typically ranging from 50mg BID to 150mg BID,  depending on the individual's BSA.  A healthcare provider will determine the most appropriate approach and the precise dosage.

Dosage adjustments may be needed in cases of significant gastrointestinal side effects like vomiting or diarrhea leading to dehydration or weight loss. In such cases, the dose might be reduced.  The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.

**Pediatric considerations:**  Lonafarnib is not recommended for children and adolescents with a BSA < 0.39 m² due to the lack of an appropriate dosage strength.  BSA-directed or BSA fixed-dose regimens (as described above) are used for eligible pediatric patients.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) include:

*   Fatigue
*   Headache
*   Cerebral ischemia (reduced blood flow to the brain)
*   Hypertension (high blood pressure)
*   Skin rash
*   Decreased serum bicarbonate levels
*   Electrolyte imbalances (various types)
*   Weight loss
*   Abdominal pain
*   Anorexia (loss of appetite)
*   Constipation
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Decreased white blood cell count, red blood cell count, or platelet counts
*   Increased liver enzymes (ALT and AST)
*   Infections
*   Musculoskeletal pain
*   Eye problems (various types)
*   Cough
*   Nosebleeds
*   Upper respiratory infections
*   Fever


Less common side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients) include:

*   Depressed mood
*   Itching
*   Dehydration
*   Flatulence (gas)
*   Mouth sores


Serious side effects are possible, although less frequent. Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported immediately to a healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Lonafarnib is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor. Farnesyltransferase is an enzyme crucial in a process called farnesylation, where a molecule called a farnesyl group attaches to certain proteins.  In HGPS and some progeroid laminopathies, abnormal proteins, like progerin, accumulate in cells due to improper farnesylation.  Lonafarnib blocks farnesyltransferase, preventing the abnormal proteins from accumulating and reducing their harmful effects on cells.  This helps to slow the progression of the disease.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Lonafarnib should not be used with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers or inhibitors, midazolam, lovastatin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Lonafarnib interacts with numerous other drugs, significantly affecting their metabolism and potentially leading to increased side effects or reduced efficacy.  A comprehensive list of interactions is available in the full prescribing information.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are currently taking.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Lonafarnib may harm a developing fetus.  Effective contraception is recommended during treatment.  It is unknown whether Lonafarnib is excreted in breast milk, thus breastfeeding should be discussed with a healthcare provider to assess risk vs benefit.
*   **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of blood counts, liver function tests, electrolyte levels and renal function are necessary to detect any adverse effects.  Regular ophthalmologic examinations are also recommended.
*   **Other Precautions:** Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, and Seville orange juice while taking Lonafarnib.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How should I store Lonafarnib?** A: Store Lonafarnib at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Follow the specific storage instructions on the prescription label.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose with food up to 8 hours before the next scheduled dose.  If less than 8 hours remain, skip the missed dose and resume the normal schedule.

*   **Q: Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Lonafarnib?** A: No, grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided as they can interfere with the drug's metabolism.

*   **Q: Are there long-term effects associated with Lonafarnib?** A:  Long-term effects of Lonafarnib are not fully known because it is used to treat rare diseases.  Regular monitoring is essential to assess for potential long-term side effects.

*   **Q:  Who should not take Lonafarnib?** A: Patients with certain genetic conditions resulting in progerin accumulation are the primary candidates, and only if this has been assessed and confirmed by a medical expert. Patients with significant pre-existing liver or kidney problems should approach using this medication with extra caution, as the manufacturer's guidance for those situations is absent. Individuals taking interacting medications should discuss the use of this medication with their physicians.
