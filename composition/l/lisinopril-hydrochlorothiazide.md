# Lisinopril + Hydrochlorothiazide
### Generic Name
Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide

### Usage
Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide is a combination medication used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by combining two different types of blood pressure-lowering drugs:  lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic.  By working together, they effectively reduce blood pressure more than either drug alone. This combination is often prescribed when a single medication hasn't been sufficient to control blood pressure.  While its primary use is hypertension, it may also be used in some cases to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke or heart attack in patients with certain risk factors, particularly those with high blood pressure and diabetes or history of cardiovascular disease.  The use of this combination medication should always be under the guidance of a physician who will consider the individual's medical history and other factors.


### Dosage
Dosage of Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide varies greatly depending on individual needs and response to treatment. It's crucial to follow your doctor's specific instructions. There's no standardized "one-size-fits-all" dosage.  The medication comes in various tablet strengths, and your doctor will determine the appropriate starting dose and potential adjustments over time.  For example, a common starting dose might be 10mg/12.5mg or 20mg/12.5mg of lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide, taken once daily.  Children usually do not receive this combination medication.  IV administration is not typical for this drug combination;  lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide are almost always given orally as tablets.  Your doctor will carefully monitor your blood pressure and adjust your dose as needed. Never change your dose or stop taking the medication without consulting your doctor.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Fatigue
* Dry cough (more common with lisinopril)
* Headache
* Muscle cramps
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Changes in urination (due to the diuretic)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema â€“ a medical emergency)
*  Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)
*  High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
*  Kidney problems
*  Severe allergic reactions


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide lowers blood pressure through two complementary mechanisms:

* **Lisinopril (ACE inhibitor):** This medication blocks the action of an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE plays a role in narrowing blood vessels. By blocking ACE, lisinopril causes the blood vessels to relax and widen, reducing blood pressure.

* **Hydrochlorothiazide (thiazide diuretic):** This medication increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through urine. This reduces the volume of blood circulating, thereby decreasing blood pressure.

The combination of these two mechanisms provides a synergistic effect, leading to a more significant and sustained reduction in blood pressure compared to using either drug alone.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used by individuals with certain conditions, such as severe kidney disease, an allergy to sulfa drugs (hydrochlorothiazide belongs to this class), or a history of angioedema.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding are also contraindications.  Always inform your doctor of all allergies and medical conditions before starting this medication.

* **Drug Interactions:** Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide can interact with various other medications, including potassium supplements, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and diabetes medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.

* **Specific warnings:** Older adults and individuals with kidney or liver disease require careful monitoring while taking this combination therapy, as it can impact these organs. The same goes for patients with diabetes, as this medication can affect blood glucose levels.

* **Alcohol:** Avoid excessive alcohol consumption, as it can lower blood pressure and increase the risk of side effects.

* **Driving and machinery:** Dizziness and lightheadedness are possible side effects; therefore, caution is advised when driving or operating heavy machinery.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide suddenly?**  A: No, never stop taking this medication abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the medication in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, and keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Is it safe to take Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy?** A: No, it is not safe. This medication is contraindicated during pregnancy.

* **Q: Can I take Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide with other medications?** A: This requires careful consideration and discussion with your doctor.  Certain interactions can occur with other drugs.

* **Q: What if I experience a severe allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention. Severe allergic reactions can be life-threatening.
