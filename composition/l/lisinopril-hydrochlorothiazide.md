# Lisinopril + Hydrochlorothiazide

**Generic Name:** Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).

The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and health status.

**How it Works:**  Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor. It works by relaxing blood vessels and lowering the amount of fluid in the body, thus lowering blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill). It helps your body get rid of excess salt and water, also contributing to lower blood pressure.  The combination of these two medications provides a more effective blood pressure-lowering effect than either drug alone.
