### Generic Name

Lycopene + Cyanocobalamin + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + Niacinamide + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Copper Sulphate + Manganese Sulphate + Beta Carotene + Selenium dioxide  (This is a combination product and doesn't have a single generic name. The name reflects the individual components.)


### Usage

This combination supplement provides a blend of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Its primary use is to support overall health and well-being by addressing potential nutritional deficiencies.  The individual components each contribute specific benefits:

* **Lycopene:**  A powerful antioxidant associated with potential benefits for heart health and prostate health.
* **Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12):** Essential for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. Deficiencies can lead to anemia and neurological problems.
* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6):** Involved in many metabolic processes, including brain development and function, immune function, and red blood cell formation.
* **Niacinamide (Vitamin B3):**  Plays a role in energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cell signaling.  It's also important for skin health.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate (Zinc):**  Essential for immune function, wound healing, and cell growth.
* **Copper Sulphate (Copper):**  Necessary for iron metabolism, energy production, and nerve function.
* **Manganese Sulphate (Manganese):**  Involved in bone health, wound healing, and metabolism.
* **Beta Carotene (provitamin A):**  The body converts beta-carotene into Vitamin A, crucial for vision, immune function, and cell growth.
* **Selenium Dioxide (Selenium):** An antioxidant that supports thyroid function and immune function.

This combination supplement aims to provide a synergistic effect, meaning the combined ingredients may work better together than individually. However, it's important to note that this isn't a cure for any specific disease.  It's intended as a nutritional support product.


### Dosage

Dosage will vary depending on the specific formulation of the product and individual needs.  Always follow the instructions provided on the product label.  There isn't a standard, universally applicable dosage as this is a combination product.  A healthcare professional can advise on the appropriate dosage based on individual health status and potential deficiencies.  This supplement is typically taken orally.  Intravenous administration is not relevant for this combination product.



### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and infrequent.  However,  some individuals may experience:

* Upset stomach

If you experience any concerning side effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

This supplement works by providing the body with essential vitamins and minerals that may be lacking in the diet. The antioxidants (Lycopene, Beta Carotene, and Selenium) help neutralize harmful free radicals, potentially reducing oxidative stress and its damaging effects on cells. The vitamins and minerals participate in various metabolic processes, contributing to overall health and well-being.  The synergistic effect, if present, is attributed to the combined action of these nutrients in supporting various bodily functions.
