# Lasmiditan
### Generic Name
Lasmiditan

### Usage
Lasmiditan is used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults.  It's crucial to understand that Lasmiditan is *not* a preventative medication for migraine; it's designed to relieve symptoms *during* a migraine episode.


### Dosage
Lasmiditan is available as an oral tablet in 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg strengths.  The recommended dose is a single tablet (50, 100, or 200 mg) at the onset of a migraine.  Only one dose should be taken within a 24-hour period. The choice of dosage will be determined by your physician, and may be adjusted based on individual response.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Adults:** The maximum dose is one tablet in 24 hours.  The safety of treating more than four migraine attacks per month has not been fully established.
* **Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of Lasmiditan in children have not been established.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** For those with mild or moderate liver impairment, no dosage adjustment is needed. However, Lasmiditan is not recommended for individuals with severe liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are necessary for those with kidney problems.

### How it Works
Lasmiditan is a serotonin (5-HT)<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonist.  This means it binds to and activates specific serotonin receptors in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter involved in pain processing and migraine pathophysiology.  While the exact mechanism isn't fully understood, it's believed that activating these receptors helps reduce migraine pain and associated symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Lasmiditan can cause dizziness and drowsiness. Avoid driving or operating machinery for at least 8 hours after taking a dose.
* **Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants:** Combining Lasmiditan with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of drowsiness and other adverse effects.
* **Cardiovascular Disease:** Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, as Lasmiditan can affect heart rate and blood pressure.
* **Serotonin-Increasing Medications:**  Avoid concomitant use with medications that increase serotonin levels, as this could increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.
* **P-gp and BCRP Substrates:**  Lasmiditan inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Concomitant use with drugs that are substrates of these transporters should be avoided.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** There is limited data on the use of Lasmiditan during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Dizziness and increased systolic blood pressure may occur more frequently in older adults.  Start with a lower dose if you are an older adult.
