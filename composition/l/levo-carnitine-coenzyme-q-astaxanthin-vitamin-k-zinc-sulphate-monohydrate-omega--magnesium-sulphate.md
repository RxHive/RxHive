### Usage

This combination of ingredients is often marketed as a supplement aimed at supporting cardiovascular health, boosting energy levels, and promoting overall well-being. Let's look at each component's individual uses:

* **Levo-carnitine:**  Plays a crucial role in energy production within cells. It's sometimes used to treat certain metabolic disorders and may improve symptoms in individuals with heart failure or chronic kidney disease.

* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):**  An antioxidant that acts as a vital component in energy production within cells.  It's often used to support heart health and may help manage symptoms of conditions like heart failure.

* **Astaxanthin:** A potent antioxidant with potential benefits for eye health, skin health, and reducing inflammation.

* **Vitamin K:** Essential for blood clotting and bone health.

* **Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate:** A form of zinc, a mineral vital for immune function, wound healing, and cell growth.

* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:**  Essential fatty acids with anti-inflammatory properties and numerous health benefits, including heart health, brain function, and reduced risk of certain diseases.

* **Magnesium Sulfate:** A form of magnesium, an essential mineral involved in many bodily functions, including muscle function, nerve transmission, and blood sugar control.


This combination aims to synergistically enhance these individual benefits, though robust clinical evidence supporting this combined effect is limited.


### Dosage

There is no standardized dosage for this specific combination.  Each component has its recommended dosage, which varies based on factors such as age, health status, and the specific product formulation.
