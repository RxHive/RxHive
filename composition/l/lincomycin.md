# Lincomycin
### Generic Name
Lincomycin

### Usage
Lincomycin is a lincosamide antibiotic primarily used to treat serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of bacteria.  These include streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. It's generally reserved for patients who are allergic to penicillin or for whom penicillin is deemed unsuitable by a physician due to potential complications or inefficacy.  Lincomycin is effective against both gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria.  While it has shown some efficacy in other infections, its use should be carefully considered and only prescribed by a doctor for appropriate indications.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration (IM: intramuscular, IV: intravenous), the severity of the infection, and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow a doctor's precise instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Serious bacterial infection (IM):** 600 mg every 12-24 hours.
* **Serious bacterial infection (IV):** 0.6-1 g continuous infusion over at least 1 hour, every 8-12 hours.  Maximum daily dose: 8 g.
* **Ophthalmic/Subconjunctival injection:** 75 mg (0.25 mL) for at least 5 hours.

**Children (infants >1 month, children, and adolescents):**

* **Serious bacterial infection (IM):** 10 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 12-24 hours.
* **Serious bacterial infection (IV):** 10-20 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8-12 hours. Maximum daily dose: 8 g.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments; use with caution.
* **Renal Impairment:** Mild to moderate impairment generally doesn't require dosage adjustments, but severe impairment necessitates a 70-75% dose reduction.  For end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis,  no specific adjustments are provided; use with extreme caution. Lincomycin is not removed by either dialysis method.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain or distress

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Colitis (inflammation of the colon), including pseudomembranous colitis and potentially fatal *Clostridioides difficile*-associated diarrhea (CDAD)
* Allergic reactions (ranging from rash to life-threatening anaphylaxis)
* Liver function abnormalities
* Blood disorders (e.g., leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Renal insufficiency


**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any adverse effects, even those not listed here, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Lincomycin is a bacteriostatic antibiotic (it inhibits bacterial growth). It works by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, specifically the 23S rRNA. This binding prevents ribosomal translocation, a crucial step in protein synthesis.  By inhibiting protein synthesis, lincomycin effectively stops the growth and multiplication of susceptible bacteria, allowing the body's immune system to clear the infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Lincomycin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to lincomycin, clindamycin, or any formulation component; those with pre-existing monilial (Candida) infections; and newborns.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients using lincomycin have an increased risk of colitis (including CDAD), hypersensitivity reactions (potentially severe), and bacterial or fungal superinfections.
* **Use with Caution:** Lincomycin should be used cautiously in patients with significant allergies, asthma, gastrointestinal disease (especially colitis), hepatic or renal impairment, the elderly, and neonates.
* **Drug Interactions:** Lincomycin may interact with several drugs, including neuromuscular blocking agents (enhancing their effect), erythromycin (diminishing its effect), and others. Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Lincomycin is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. It's excreted in breast milk, so use caution during breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Lincomycin?** A:  Store as directed by your pharmacist or the medication label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Lincomycin if I feel better?** A:  No, complete the prescribed course even if you feel better to prevent recurrence of the infection and the development of antibiotic resistance.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose.
* **Q: Is Lincomycin safe for everyone?** A:  No, it is contraindicated in certain individuals and requires caution in others. Your doctor will assess your health status to determine if Lincomycin is appropriate for you.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe diarrhea?** A: Severe diarrhea can be a sign of *Clostridioides difficile*-associated diarrhea (CDAD). Contact your doctor immediately if this occurs.
