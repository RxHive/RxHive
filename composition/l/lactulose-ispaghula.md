# Lactulose + Ispaghula

**Generic Name:** Lactulose + Ispaghula husk (This is usually sold under various brand names)

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to treat constipation. Lactulose is a laxative that works by drawing water into the bowels, softening the stool and making it easier to pass. Ispaghula husk is a bulk-forming laxative that absorbs water in the intestines, increasing stool bulk and promoting regular bowel movements.  Together, they provide a dual action for effective constipation relief. It's typically used for chronic constipation when other measures haven't been successful.  Always follow the dosage instructions on the product label or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.


**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Gas:** This is quite common, especially when starting the medication.
* **Bloating:** Similar to gas, this is often a temporary side effect.
* **Abdominal cramping or discomfort:** This can occur, especially with higher doses.
* **Diarrhea:**  If you experience excessive diarrhea, reduce your dosage or stop taking the medication and consult your doctor.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions (such as rash, itching, swelling) are possible. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any allergic reaction.


**How it Works:**  The combination works synergistically:

* **Lactulose:** This is a non-absorbable sugar. It draws water into the intestines via osmosis, softening the stool and stimulating bowel movements.  It primarily acts in the colon.

* **Ispaghula husk:** This is a soluble fiber. It absorbs water in the intestines, forming a bulkier stool that stimulates peristalsis (the natural contractions of the intestines) and promotes easier passage of stool.  It works throughout the digestive tract.

The combined action of these two ingredients makes bowel movements easier and more regular.
