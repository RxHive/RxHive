# Levosalbutamol + Budesonide

**Generic Name:** Levosalbutamol/Budesonide

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to prevent and treat wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing caused by asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Levosalbutamol is a short-acting beta2-agonist bronchodilator that quickly relaxes the muscles around the airways, making it easier to breathe. Budesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the airways.  It's important to note that this combination is typically for maintenance treatment, not for immediate relief of an acute asthma attack.  A separate, quick-relief inhaler should be used for that purpose.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Levosalbutamol/Budesonide can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects can include:

* **Levosalbutamol-related:** Tremor, headache, muscle cramps, nervousness, increased heart rate, palpitations.
* **Budesonide-related:** Hoarseness, throat irritation, oral thrush (fungal infection in the mouth), headache, cough.
* **Less common but more serious:**  Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing), increased risk of pneumonia (especially in COPD patients),  high blood sugar, glaucoma, cataracts.

This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult the patient information leaflet or your doctor for a complete list.

**How it Works:**

* **Levosalbutamol:** This medication works by binding to beta2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs. This action relaxes the muscles surrounding the airways, widening them and making it easier to breathe.  This effect is rapid and short-lasting.
* **Budesonide:** This corticosteroid works by reducing inflammation in the airways.  Inflammation is a major contributor to asthma and COPD symptoms, so by reducing it, budesonide helps to prevent symptoms from occurring.  This effect is not immediate; it takes time to build up in the system.  The combination of the two medications provides both quick relief and long-term control.
