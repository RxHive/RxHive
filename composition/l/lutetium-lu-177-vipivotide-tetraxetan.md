# Lutetium Lu 177 Vipivotide Tetraxetan
### Generic Name
Lutetium Lu 177 Vipivotide Tetraxetan

### Usage
Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan is a targeted radiotherapy used to treat adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Specifically, it's indicated for patients whose cancer is positive for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and who have already received treatment with androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy.  This means it's a treatment option for advanced prostate cancer after other therapies have been tried.

### Dosage
The typical adult dosage is an intravenous (IV) injection of 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) administered every 6 weeks for up to 6 doses. Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.  Patient selection should be based on PSMA expression in tumors, ideally confirmed via imaging with gallium Ga 68 gozetotide or another approved PSMA-11 imaging agent.

**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and effectiveness of lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on several factors including renal and bone marrow function and the severity of side effects.  

* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-89 mL/min), no dosage adjustment is formally recommended, but close monitoring of kidney function and adverse reactions is crucial.  Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease patients have not been studied.
* **Myelosuppression (low blood cell counts):** Dose modification or discontinuation may be needed depending on the severity of myelosuppression.  Treatment might be temporarily paused or the dose reduced if there is Grade 2 or higher myelosuppression.  Grade 3 or higher myelosuppression that recurs after a dose reduction leads to permanent discontinuation of treatment.
* **Other Adverse Reactions:** Dosage adjustments, including temporary interruption or dose reduction, or permanent discontinuation, are determined based on the severity and nature of other side effects such as dry mouth, gastrointestinal toxicity, fatigue, and electrolyte abnormalities.  Specific guidelines for these adjustments are available in the full prescribing information.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Hematologic: Decreased lymphocytes, hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, and neutrophils (types of blood cells); anemia (low red blood cell count); thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, constipation, and diarrhea.
* Laboratory Abnormalities: Decreased calcium, changes in sodium and potassium levels, increased AST (liver enzyme), and increased creatinine (kidney function marker).
* Infection: Urinary tract infections.
* Others: Fatigue, dry mouth, and weight loss.

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (Occurring in <10% of patients):**

* Acute kidney injury.
* Severe decrease in blood cell counts.
* Severe gastrointestinal problems.
* Neurological effects like dizziness and headache.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan is a radioligand therapy. It works by targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a protein found on the surface of many prostate cancer cells. The lutetium-177 isotope in the drug emits radiation that destroys PSMA-expressing cancer cells and nearby cells.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Currently, no specific contraindications for lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan are listed.
* **Increased Risks:** Patients are at increased risk of radiation exposure, myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression), renal (kidney) toxicity, infertility in males, and embryo-fetal toxicity.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The drug can harm a developing fetus;  effective contraception is essential for both male and female partners during treatment and for a period afterward.  There is no information on the presence of the drug in breast milk.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While not extensively studied, potential interactions with other medications may exist. Itâ€™s crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking.
* **Other Precautions:** Patients should be well-hydrated and encouraged to urinate frequently to reduce radiation exposure to the bladder.  They also need to follow instructions for minimizing radiation exposure to others after treatment.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the treatment last?** A: Treatment typically involves up to six doses given every six weeks, but this can vary based on response and tolerance.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to reschedule your treatment.

* **Q: Are there any dietary restrictions?** A: There are no specific dietary restrictions, but maintaining good hydration is important.

* **Q: How is the drug stored?** A: This medication is a radioactive substance and must be stored and handled according to strict guidelines provided by your healthcare facility.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects to your doctor immediately. They may need to adjust your dose or temporarily stop treatment.  Early intervention can help manage adverse effects effectively.
