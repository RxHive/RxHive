# Lactobacillus Rhamnosus GG
### Generic Name
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG

### Usage
*Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GG is a probiotic, a live microorganism considered beneficial for health.  Its primary use is in restoring the balance of good bacteria in the gut. This is particularly helpful after antibiotic use, which can disrupt the natural gut flora, leading to conditions like antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GG may also be used to prevent or treat certain types of diarrhea in children and adults, and to improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  It's also sometimes used to support immune function, although more research is needed in this area.  It's crucial to understand that *L. rhamnosus* GG is a dietary supplement and not a treatment for serious illnesses.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the product formulation (capsules, chewable tablets, powder) and the specific condition being treated.  Always follow the instructions on the product label.

**Adults:** For general use as a dietary supplement, a typical dose is 1 capsule or chewable tablet containing 10 billion colony-forming units (CFU) once daily.  In cases of diarrhea or other digestive issues, the dosage may be increased to twice daily, but this should be discussed with a healthcare professional.

**Children:**  Dosages for children are typically lower and may be given as half a capsule to one capsule daily, depending on age and weight. The capsule should be opened, and the contents mixed into a cool drink, baby food, or applesauce.  Always consult a pediatrician before giving probiotics to children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with liver or kidney impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.  However, it's always best to consult a doctor before starting any new supplement, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions.


### Side Effects
Generally, *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GG is well-tolerated. However, some individuals may experience:

* Bloating
* Flatulence (gas)

These side effects are usually mild and temporary.  Severe side effects are rare. If you experience any concerning side effects, discontinue use and contact your doctor.


### How it Works
*Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GG works by colonizing the gut and competing with harmful bacteria for resources and space.  This helps restore the balance of the gut microbiota (the community of microorganisms in the intestines).  It also stimulates the immune system locally in the gut, potentially strengthening its defenses against pathogens.  Additionally, it aids in water reabsorption in the colon, helping alleviate some symptoms of diarrhea.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GG is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the probiotic or its components, immunocompromised individuals (due to increased risk of infection), and those with a history of gastrointestinal perforation.

* **Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution when using *L. rhamnosus* GG in immunocompromised individuals, patients sensitive to milk proteins (as some formulations may contain dairy), and during pregnancy or breastfeeding (safety not fully established).

* **Interactions:** Although generally safe, it is advisable to take *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GG at least two hours before or after taking medications, especially antibiotics, to prevent interference with their effectiveness.

* **Other Considerations:**  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all supplements you are taking, including probiotics, to avoid potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.
