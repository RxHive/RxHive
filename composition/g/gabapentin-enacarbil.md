# Gabapentin Enacarbil
### Generic Name
Gabapentin Enacarbil

### Usage

Gabapentin enacarbil is primarily used to treat two conditions in adults:

*   **Moderate-to-severe primary restless legs syndrome (RLS):**  RLS is a neurological disorder characterized by an overwhelming urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations.  Gabapentin enacarbil helps alleviate these sensations and the urge to move, improving sleep quality.

*   **Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN):** PHN is a chronic pain condition that can develop after a shingles infection. The pain is typically burning, shooting, or stabbing and can be debilitating. Gabapentin enacarbil helps manage this neuropathic pain, reducing its intensity and frequency.

It's crucial to note that gabapentin enacarbil is *not* interchangeable with other gabapentin products due to differences in how the body processes them.  It is also not recommended for individuals who need to sleep during the day and stay awake at night.


### Dosage

**Important Note:** Gabapentin enacarbil is not interchangeable with other gabapentin formulations.  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with kidney problems.

**Adults:**

*   **Restless Legs Syndrome:** The usual starting dose is 600 mg once daily, ideally around 5 PM. If a dose is missed, it should be taken the next day as prescribed.

*   **Postherpetic Neuralgia:**  The initial dose is 600 mg once daily in the morning for three days.  This is then increased to 600 mg twice daily (BID) starting on day 4.  Doses exceeding 1200 mg/day are not recommended due to increased risk of side effects and lack of additional benefit. If a dose is missed, it should be skipped, and the next dose taken as scheduled.

**Dosage Adjustments (Renal Impairment):**  Dosage must be adjusted in patients with kidney problems. The Cockcroft-Gault formula is typically used to estimate creatinine clearance (CrCl) to guide dosage.  Specific adjustments vary depending on the CrCl value and the condition being treated (RLS or PHN). Consult a healthcare professional for specific instructions.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of gabapentin enacarbil in children have not been established.

**Administration:** Gabapentin enacarbil is administered orally.  Tablets should be swallowed whole; do not crush, chew, or break them.

### How it Works

Gabapentin enacarbil is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, gabapentin, in the body.  Gabapentin is related to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in brain function. However, gabapentin doesn't directly interact with GABA receptors. Instead, it binds to specific voltage-gated calcium channels in the brain, particularly those containing the alpha-2-delta-1 subunit. This binding modulates the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, potentially reducing pain signals and the urge to move in the case of RLS. The exact mechanism for RLS is still not fully understood.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling. However, caution is advised in certain populations.

*   **Drug Interactions:** Gabapentin enacarbil can interact with other medications, potentially affecting their effectiveness or increasing side effects.  Inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.  Specific examples include interactions with orlistat, morphine, antacids, ginkgo biloba, and evening primrose oil.

*   **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking gabapentin enacarbil, as it can increase the risk of drowsiness and dizziness.

*   **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Gabapentin enacarbil can cause drowsiness and dizziness; avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.

*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Gabapentin enacarbil is classified as Category C during pregnancy, meaning its effects on the developing fetus are unknown.  It's crucial to discuss the risks and benefits with a healthcare professional before taking it during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.

*   **Renal Impairment:** Gabapentin enacarbil is primarily eliminated by the kidneys. Dosage adjustments are crucial in individuals with kidney problems to avoid medication buildup.

*   **Elderly:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of gabapentin enacarbil.

*   **Suicidal Thoughts:**  There is a reported increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with gabapentin. Seek immediate medical help if you experience such thoughts.
