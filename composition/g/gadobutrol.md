# Gadobutrol
### Generic Name
Gadobutrol

### Usage
Gadobutrol is a gadolinium-based contrast agent used with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.  Its primary use is to enhance the visualization of various body structures and processes, improving the diagnostic accuracy of MRI.  Specifically, it's used:

* **In the Central Nervous System (CNS):** To detect and visualize areas with a disrupted blood-brain barrier and/or abnormal blood vessel patterns. This helps in diagnosing various neurological conditions.
* **In the Breast:** To assess the presence and extent of breast cancer.
* **In the Cardiovascular System:** To evaluate known or suspected diseases of the major arteries in the neck and kidneys (supra-aortic and renal arteries) and to assess blood flow to the heart muscle (myocardial perfusion) in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific MRI application (CNS, breast, angiography, cardiac), the patient's weight, and age.  It's always administered intravenously (IV).  Precise dosage instructions are provided by the prescribing physician and should be strictly followed.

**General Adult Dosage Guidelines (Examples):**

* **MRI of the CNS:**  Typically 0.1 mmol/kg (0.1 mL/kg) administered as a relatively rapid IV injection.
* **MRI of the Breast:** Similar to CNS imaging, often as a bolus injection followed by a saline flush.
* **MR Angiography:**  Often 0.1 mmol/kg (0.1 mL/kg) injected via a power injector, followed by a saline flush.
* **Cardiac MRI:** Given as two separate bolus injections, 0.05 mL/kg (0.05 mmol/kg) each, at peak stress and at rest.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

Dosage for neonates, children, and adolescents is often the same as for adults, but it's crucial to strictly follow the physician's instructions based on the child's weight and specific imaging needs.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustment is typically recommended.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustment isn't usually recommended, but gadobutrol should be used with extreme caution in patients with impaired kidney function due to a significantly increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).  Hemodialysis is preferred if gadobutrol is administered to patients already undergoing hemodialysis.  Peritoneal dialysis is less effective at removing gadobutrol.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Nausea

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Altered sense of smell
* Anaphylactic shock/Anaphylaxis
* Angioedema
* Dizziness
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Skin erythema (redness)
* Feeling hot or cold
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Injection site reactions
* Loss of consciousness
* Maculopapular rash
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) â€“ A serious and potentially fatal condition affecting the skin and other organs, especially in patients with kidney problems.
* Palpitations
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Parosmia (distorted sense of smell)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Seizures
* Skin rash
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Vomiting
* Xerostomia (dry mouth)


**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Gadobutrol is a paramagnetic contrast agent containing gadolinium.  When exposed to a strong magnetic field during an MRI scan, it alters the magnetic properties of surrounding water molecules. This alteration enhances the contrast of images, making it easier to visualize certain tissues and structures, particularly those with abnormal blood flow or disrupted barriers like the blood-brain barrier.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Gadobutrol is contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity to gadobutrol or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients with impaired kidney function are at significantly increased risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a potentially life-threatening condition.  Gadobutrol should be avoided in these patients unless absolutely necessary.
* **Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Gadobutrol is classified as pregnancy category C.  The decision to breastfeed while receiving gadobutrol should be made carefully in consultation with a physician, weighing the benefits and risks to both mother and infant.  Temporary discontinuation of breastfeeding might be recommended.
* **Other Precautions:** Use with caution in patients with sickle cell disease, a history of allergic reactions or asthma, renal impairment, or a history of seizures.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does gadobutrol stay in my body?** A:  Most of gadobutrol is excreted through the kidneys within 24 hours.
* **Q:  Is gadobutrol safe for pregnant women?** A:  Gadobutrol should be avoided during pregnancy unless the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Consult your doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your doctor immediately.
* **Q: How is gadobutrol stored?** A:  Store gadobutrol as directed by your physician or pharmacist.
* **Q:  Can I drive after receiving gadobutrol?** A: Some side effects like dizziness are possible. Follow your doctor's advice.
