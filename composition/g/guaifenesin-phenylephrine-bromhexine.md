# Guaifenesin + Phenylephrine + Bromhexine

**Generic Name:** Guaifenesin + Phenylephrine + Bromhexine  (Note: This combination is not a standard, pre-made, FDA-approved fixed-dose combination in the US or many other countries.  It is likely found in various formulations and strengths across different regions. The information below is based on the individual components and should not be considered a complete guide for any specific product.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for specific guidance on medication use.)


**Usage:** This combination is typically used to relieve symptoms of the common cold or upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs).  Each ingredient targets different symptoms:

* **Guaifenesin:**  A expectorant that thins and loosens mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.
* **Bromhexine:** An expectorant that helps break down mucus, assisting in its removal.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the specific dosage of each component. Possible side effects include:

* **Guaifenesin:** Nausea, vomiting, headache, stomach upset.  Rarely, allergic reactions.
* **Phenylephrine:**  Increased blood pressure, nervousness, dizziness, headache, insomnia, palpitations.  Should be avoided in individuals with high blood pressure, heart disease, or thyroid problems.
* **Bromhexine:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, allergic reactions (rash, itching).


**How it Works:**

* **Guaifenesin:** Increases the fluid content of respiratory tract secretions, making the mucus less viscous and easier to expel.
* **Phenylephrine:**  Acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Bromhexine:** Reduces the viscosity of mucus by altering the chemical structure of mucopolysaccharides, making it easier to cough up.
