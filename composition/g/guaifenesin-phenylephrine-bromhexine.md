# Guaifenesin + Phenylephrine + Bromhexine
### Generic Name
Guaifenesin + Phenylephrine + Bromhexine


### Usage

This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  It combines the actions of three different active ingredients:

* **Guaifenesin:** This acts as an expectorant, helping to thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.  This is particularly helpful when dealing with a productive cough (a cough that produces phlegm).

* **Phenylephrine:** This is a decongestant, meaning it helps to shrink swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving congestion and stuffiness.  It can provide temporary relief from a blocked or runny nose.

* **Bromhexine:** This is also an expectorant, working to break down mucus and facilitate its removal from the respiratory tract.  It can be particularly beneficial in cases of thick, tenacious mucus.


The primary use is for symptomatic relief of upper respiratory tract infections characterized by cough with mucus production and nasal congestion.  It does *not* treat the underlying infection itself (like a viral infection) but focuses solely on managing the symptoms.


### Dosage

Dosage will vary depending on the specific formulation (e.g., tablet, syrup, liquid capsule), the manufacturer, and the age and weight of the patient.  **Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.**  There is no universally applicable dosage for this combination, and self-medication should be approached with caution.   This information should not substitute advice from a doctor or pharmacist.

**Oral Forms (Tablet/Syrup):**  Adult and child dosages are highly variable and must be obtained from product labeling or a healthcare provider.  The dosage will be based on age and the severity of the symptoms.

**IV Administration:** This combination is not typically administered intravenously (IV).  Guaifenesin, phenylephrine, and bromhexine are usually taken orally.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Sleep disturbances
* Nervousness
* Increased heart rate
* Dry mouth
* Stomach upset

Less common but more serious side effects may include allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), severe dizziness, and high blood pressure.

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Each ingredient works through a different mechanism:

* **Guaifenesin:** Increases the fluid content of respiratory tract secretions, making the mucus less viscous and easier to expectorate.

* **Phenylephrine:** Acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) in the nasal mucosa, thus reducing swelling and congestion.

* **Bromhexine:**  Reduces the viscosity of mucus by altering its chemical composition, facilitating its removal from the airways.


Together, these ingredients aim to provide comprehensive relief from the symptoms of a productive cough and nasal congestion.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Do not use this medication if you are allergic to guaifenesin, phenylephrine, bromhexine, or any other ingredients in the formulation.
* **High Blood Pressure:** Phenylephrine can elevate blood pressure.  Individuals with hypertension or other cardiovascular conditions should use this medication with caution and under the supervision of a doctor.
* **Diabetes:** Phenylephrine can affect blood sugar levels.  Diabetics should monitor their blood glucose levels carefully while using this medication.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult a doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This combination may interact with other medications, including MAO inhibitors, certain antidepressants, and other decongestants. Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Other Health Conditions:** Individuals with certain medical conditions (e.g., glaucoma, thyroid problems, enlarged prostate) should exercise caution and seek medical advice before using this medication.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Drowsiness or dizziness can occur; avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.
