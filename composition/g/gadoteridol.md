# Gadoteridol
### Generic Name
Gadoteridol

### Usage
Gadoteridol is a gadolinium-based contrast agent used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.  Its primary use is to enhance the visualization of lesions in the brain, spine, and associated tissues in both adult and pediatric patients (including newborns).  These lesions often have a disrupted blood-brain barrier or abnormal blood vessel patterns.  In adults, it's also used to improve visualization of lesions in the head and neck areas.  The improved visualization helps radiologists better characterize and diagnose various conditions.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **CNS (Central Nervous System) Imaging:**  The standard intravenous (IV) dose is 0.1 mmol/kg (0.2 mL/kg) body weight. A second dose of 0.2 mmol/kg (0.4 mL/kg) may be given once, if needed, within 30 minutes of the first dose.
* **Extracranial/Extraspinal Head and Neck Imaging:** The standard IV dose is 0.1 mmol/kg (0.2 mL/kg) body weight.

**Pediatrics (infants, children, and adolescents):**

* **CNS Imaging:** The standard IV dose is 0.1 mmol/kg (0.2 mL/kg) body weight.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are usually necessary, however, the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) increases with decreasing renal function.  Prompt hemodialysis after administration should be considered in patients already undergoing hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis is less effective at clearing gadoteridol.

**Administration:** Gadoteridol is administered intravenously.  For IV administration, it can be given as a rapid infusion (10-60 mL/min) or as a bolus injection (>60 mL/min).  The line should be flushed with 5 mL of normal saline to ensure complete delivery. MRI imaging should be completed within 60 minutes of injection.


### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Nausea

**Less Common (<1%):**

* Nervous system: Headache, dizziness, anxiety, feeling hot, tingling sensations, lethargy, loss of consciousness, changes in mental status, migraine, pain, numbness, seizures, altered taste.
* Cardiovascular: Chest pain (angina), chest tightness, cold extremities, facial swelling, slow heart rate (bradycardia), flushing, low blood pressure (hypotension), fast heart rate (tachycardia), palpitations, near fainting (presyncope), fainting (syncope), blood vessel injury, vasodilation, vasospasm.
* Dermatologic: Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), rash, itching (pruritus), hives (urticaria).
* Endocrine and metabolic: Decreased blood urea nitrogen, high chloride levels (hyperchloremia), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).
* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain or distress, decreased appetite, diarrhea, altered taste, gum pain or inflammation (gingivitis), oral itching, swollen tongue, vomiting, dry mouth (xerostomia).
* Hematologic: Decreased hemoglobin levels.
* Hepatic: Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT and AST).
* Local: Injection site reaction (pain, redness, warmth, coldness).
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Weakness (asthenia), back pain, decreased movement (hypokinesia), muscle stiffness.
* Ophthalmic: Itchy eyes, increased tear production.
* Otic: Ear discomfort, ringing in the ears (tinnitus).
* Respiratory: Cough, dry throat, shortness of breath (dyspnea), nasal discomfort, rhinitis, throat irritation.
* Other: Fever.


**Rare but Serious:**

* Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF): This is a serious, potentially fatal condition characterized by fibrosis (scarring) of the skin, muscles, and internal organs. It is particularly concerning in patients with severe kidney disease.
* Acute kidney injury
* Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis)


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Gadoteridol is a paramagnetic contrast agent. This means it creates a magnetic moment when placed in a magnetic field. This enhanced magnetic moment alters the magnetic environment surrounding water molecules in the body.  This alteration increases the speed at which the water molecules realign with the magnetic field, leading to a change in signal intensity on MRI images.  Areas with disrupted blood-brain barriers or abnormal vascularity take up more gadoteridol, resulting in brighter areas on the MRI scan, allowing better visualization of lesions.

### Precautions

* **Contraindicated in:** Patients with known hypersensitivity to gadoteridol or any component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients with impaired kidney function are at significantly increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).  Gadoteridol should be avoided in these patients unless the diagnostic information is absolutely essential and cannot be obtained by other means.  Careful assessment of kidney function is crucial before administration.
* **Use with Caution:** Use with caution in patients with impaired renal function.  Close monitoring of renal function before and after administration is essential.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Gadoteridol is a Category C drug in pregnancy.  While it may cross the placenta, its use should be restricted to situations where the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.  The amount excreted in breast milk is unknown, but breastfeeding may usually continue after administration.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Patients with renal impairment, particularly those with severe impairment (GFR <30 mL/minute/1.73 mÂ²), are at very high risk of developing NSF.  The dosage should not be exceeded, and sufficient time should be allowed for elimination before readministration.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may have decreased renal function and are at increased risk for NSF.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is gadoteridol stored?** A:  Store gadoteridol according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually at room temperature, protected from light and freezing.
* **Q: Can I drive after receiving gadoteridol?** A:  Some side effects, such as dizziness, may impair your ability to drive. Follow your doctor's advice.
* **Q: Is gadoteridol safe for pregnant women?** A:  The use of gadoteridol in pregnancy is controversial and should be limited to situations where the benefits significantly outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. Consult with your doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I have a severe allergic reaction?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience a severe allergic reaction, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or a severe rash.
* **Q: How long does gadoteridol stay in my body?** A:  Gadoteridol is primarily eliminated by the kidneys.  The elimination rate depends on the patient's renal function.
* **Q: Can I take other medications with gadoteridol?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, to assess potential interactions.
