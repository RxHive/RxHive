# Galsulfase
### Generic Name
Galsulfase

### Usage
Galsulfase is an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) specifically indicated for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI), also known as Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome.  MPS VI is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase. This deficiency leads to the buildup of dermatan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan (GAG), in various tissues throughout the body.  This accumulation causes a range of symptoms, including skeletal abnormalities, organ damage, and impaired physical function. Galsulfase works by replacing the missing enzyme, helping to reduce the accumulation of dermatan sulfate and improve the symptoms of MPS VI. The primary goal of treatment is to improve walking and stair-climbing ability, but it also aims to slow the progression of the disease and improve overall quality of life.


### Dosage

**Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI):**

* **Adults and Children >5 years:** The recommended dose is 1 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) once weekly.  The initial infusion rate should be 6 mL/hour for the first hour.  If tolerated, the rate can be increased to 80 mL/hour for the remaining 3 hours.  The total infusion time may be extended to up to 20 hours if infusion reactions occur. Premedication with antihistamines, with or without antipyretics, 30-60 minutes before infusion is recommended.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Cardiovascular: Chest pain, hypertension
* Nervous system: Pain, chills, absent reflexes, malaise, headache
* Dermatologic: Skin rash, pruritus (itching), urticaria (hives)
* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, gastroenteritis, nausea, vomiting
* Hypersensitivity: Angioedema (swelling)
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Ophthalmic: Conjunctivitis (pink eye), corneal opacity
* Otic: Otalgia (earache), auditory impairment
* Respiratory: Dyspnea (shortness of breath), pharyngitis (sore throat), nasal congestion, apnea (breathing cessation), laryngeal edema (swelling of the larynx), respiratory distress
* Others: Antibody development, infusion-related reactions, umbilical hernia, fever


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:** Anaphylaxis, bradycardia (slow heart rate), bronchospasm, cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin), erythema (redness), hypotension (low blood pressure), hypoxia (low oxygen levels), pallor (paleness), paresthesia (numbness or tingling), renal disease (membranous nephropathy), respiratory failure, shock, spinal cord compression, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), tachypnea (rapid breathing), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).  


**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Galsulfase is a recombinant form of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase.  In individuals with MPS VI, this enzyme is deficient, leading to the accumulation of dermatan sulfate. Galsulfase works by replacing this missing enzyme.  Once administered intravenously, it enters the bloodstream and is taken up by cells, where it helps break down the accumulated dermatan sulfate. This reduction in dermatan sulfate levels helps alleviate the symptoms and slow the progression of MPS VI.


### Precautions

* **Infusion Reactions:** Galsulfase infusions can cause hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild to severe.  Close monitoring during infusions is essential.
* **Immune-mediated Reactions:**  The body may develop antibodies against galsulfase, potentially reducing its effectiveness.
* **Acute Illness:**  Avoid administering galsulfase if the patient has an acute febrile or respiratory illness.
* **Sleep Apnea:** Use caution in patients with sleep apnea due to the risk of respiratory depression.
* **Spinal Cord Compression:** Use caution in patients with spinal or cervical cord compression.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Galsulfase is categorized as Pregnancy Category B.  The excretion of galsulfase in breast milk is unknown; use caution if breastfeeding.  Consult your healthcare provider.
* **Drug Interactions:** No significant interactions are reported in the manufacturer's labeling, but always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from galsulfase treatment?** A: The response to treatment varies among individuals. Improvement in walking and stair-climbing ability may be observed over several months.
* **Q: How is galsulfase stored?** A:  Store vials under refrigeration.  Do not keep diluted solutions at room temperature for more than 48 hours.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of galsulfase treatment?** A:  Long-term studies are ongoing, but potential long-term effects need further investigation.  Regular monitoring is important.
* **Q: Can galsulfase cure MPS VI?** A: No, galsulfase is not a cure for MPS VI, but it can significantly improve symptoms and slow disease progression.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of galsulfase?** A: Contact your doctor to determine the best course of action.  Do not double the dose.
