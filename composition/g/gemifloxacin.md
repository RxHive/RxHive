# Gemifloxacin
### Generic Name
Gemifloxacin

### Usage
Gemifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolone class.  Its primary use is in treating adults with acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ABECB) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), particularly mild to moderate CAP in outpatients with co-morbidities.  While not its primary indication, it's sometimes used as an alternative therapy for uncomplicated urogenital gonococcal infections in patients allergic to cephalosporins, usually in combination with azithromycin.  It's important to note that this off-label use should only be considered under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The usual dose is 320 mg once daily (OD).  For ABECB and mild to moderate CAP, treatment typically lasts 5 days. For uncomplicated gonococcal infections (off-label), a single 320 mg dose is administered with azithromycin.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:**  For creatinine clearance (CrCl) above 40 mL/min, no adjustment is needed. If CrCl is 40 mL/min or less, the dose is reduced to 160 mg OD.  For patients on hemodialysis, 160 mg should be given after dialysis on dialysis days; a similar dose is recommended for those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).
* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.

**Pediatric Population:** The safety and efficacy of gemifloxacin in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children.

**Administration:** Gemifloxacin can be taken with or without food. However, avoid taking it with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices within a few hours of administration due to reduced absorption. Similarly, avoid simultaneous intake with products containing iron, zinc, or magnesium.


### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Skin rash
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Vomiting
* Thrombocythemia (increased platelet count)
* Increased levels of serum ALT and AST (liver enzymes)

**Less Common but Serious:**

* Agitation, anxiety, confusion, delirium, depression, disorientation, hallucinations, seizures, suicidal thoughts, and other psychiatric effects.
* Tendonitis and tendon rupture (especially in older adults and those on corticosteroids)
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage)
* Acute renal failure
* Anaphylaxis
* <i>Clostridioides difficile</i>-associated diarrhea or colitis
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (severe skin reaction)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (severe skin reaction)
* Prolonged QT interval (heart rhythm abnormality)

**Note:**  This list is not exhaustive.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Gemifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial enzymes called DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. These enzymes are crucial for bacterial DNA replication and repair.  By blocking these enzymes, gemifloxacin prevents bacterial cells from multiplying and ultimately leads to their death.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Gemifloxacin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to gemifloxacin, other fluoroquinolones, or any component of the formulation, and in individuals with conditions that prolong the QT interval.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Gemifloxacin can interact with various medications, including antacids, caffeine, corticosteroids, and other drugs metabolized by the liver. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Gemifloxacin carries a boxed warning about potentially serious and irreversible adverse reactions such as tendonitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects.  It should be reserved for patients without alternative treatment options.  It may also exacerbate myasthenia gravis (muscle weakness).  Use with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, CNS disorders, or depression.  Patients should avoid direct sunlight exposure due to potential phototoxicity.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take gemifloxacin with food?**

A:  Gemifloxacin can be taken with or without food, but avoid taking it with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices due to decreased absorption.


**Q: How should I store gemifloxacin?**

A: Store gemifloxacin as directed on the label, usually at room temperature away from moisture and heat.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.


**Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking gemifloxacin?**

A: Itâ€™s best to avoid alcohol while taking gemifloxacin as it could potentially worsen side effects.  Consult your doctor.


**Q: Is gemifloxacin safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**

A: Gemifloxacin is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its safety hasn't been definitively established.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so its use during breastfeeding should be carefully considered.  Always discuss this with your healthcare provider.
