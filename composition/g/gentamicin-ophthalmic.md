# Gentamicin (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Gentamicin (Ophthalmic)

### Usage

Gentamicin ophthalmic is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the eye.  It's effective against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria.  The primary use is for treating various conditions such as:

* **Conjunctivitis:** (Pink eye) Inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the eyelid and covering the white part of the eye.
* **Keratitis:** Inflammation of the cornea, the clear front part of the eye.
* **Keratoconjunctivitis:** Inflammation of both the cornea and conjunctiva.
* **Corneal ulcers:** Open sores on the cornea.
* **Blepharitis:** Inflammation of the eyelids.
* **Blepharoconjunctivitis:** Inflammation of both the eyelids and conjunctiva.
* **Acute meibomianitis:** Inflammation of the meibomian glands in the eyelids.
* **Dacryocystitis:** Infection of the tear sac.


These infections are typically caused by susceptible bacteria.  It's crucial to remember that gentamicin ophthalmic is only effective against bacterial infections; it won't treat viral or fungal eye infections.  A proper diagnosis from an ophthalmologist or healthcare professional is essential before starting treatment.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the severity of the infection and the formulation (ointment or solution).  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or the dispensing pharmacist.

**Adults and Children (Ophthalmic Infections):**

* **Ointment (0.3%):** Apply a Â½-inch (1.25 cm) ribbon of ointment into the affected eye(s) two to three times daily.
* **Solution (0.3%):** Instill one to two drops into the affected eye(s) every four hours.  For severe infections, the frequency may increase to a maximum of two drops every hour, but this should only be done under the direct supervision of an ophthalmologist.

**Important Administration Notes:**

* **Avoid touching the tip of the container or tube** to prevent contamination.
* **Apply gentle pressure to the inner corner of the eye (lacrimal sac)** for one to two minutes after instillation to minimize systemic absorption.  This is especially important for the solution.
* **For children,** the dosage is typically the same as for adults, but parental supervision is necessary during administration.  Always consult a pediatrician or ophthalmologist for guidance.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Burning sensation in the eyes
* Eye irritation

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Corneal ulceration (ulcers on the cornea)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Purpura (small purple spots on the skin)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Hallucinations (rare, usually associated with systemic absorption)


If you experience any of these side effects, discontinue use and consult your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.


### How it Works

Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It works by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria.  This binding disrupts bacterial protein synthesis, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death and resolving the infection.  This mechanism of action is specific to bacteria and doesn't harm human cells.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Gentamicin ophthalmic is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to gentamicin or any component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:**  Prolonged use can increase the risk of delayed corneal healing, sensitization (allergy development), and superinfection (infection by a different microorganism).
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Gentamicin is classified as Category C during pregnancy, meaning the potential benefits may outweigh the potential risks in some cases, but this should be carefully considered by a healthcare provider. Excretion in breast milk is unknown, but minimal effective doses and punctual occlusion (temporary blockage of the tear duct) are recommended to decrease systemic absorption during breastfeeding.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are not usually required for renal or hepatic impairment due to the low systemic absorption of the ophthalmic formulation.  However, it is important to inform your doctor of any kidney or liver conditions.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible, although less likely with topical ophthalmic formulations.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long should I use Gentamicin ophthalmic?** A:  The duration of treatment depends on the severity of the infection and response to therapy. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Do not stop treatment prematurely.
* **Q: Can I wear contact lenses while using Gentamicin ophthalmic?** A: Generally, it's best to avoid contact lenses while using this medication.  Consult your ophthalmologist for specific guidance.
