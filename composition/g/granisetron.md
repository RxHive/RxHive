# Granisetron
### Generic Name
Granisetron

### Usage

Granisetron is primarily used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  It's effective in preventing these side effects during both the initial treatment and subsequent cycles.  It also has a secondary use in preventing and treating nausea and vomiting after surgery (postoperative nausea and vomiting).  While its use for postoperative nausea and vomiting is approved in adults, its use in pediatric patients is not currently recommended due to concerns about efficacy and potential for QT prolongation.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration (oral, intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SubQ), or transdermal patch) and the specific condition being treated.  Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider.  The information below is for general knowledge and does not substitute professional medical advice.

**Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV):**

* **Oral:**  The usual dose is 1 mg one hour before chemotherapy, followed by 1 mg twelve hours later.  Alternatively, a single 2 mg dose one hour before chemotherapy may be used.
* **Intravenous (IV):** Typically, 0.01 mg/kg infused over 5 minutes or injected directly over 30 seconds, 30 minutes before chemotherapy.
* **Transdermal Patch (3.1 mg/24 hours):** One patch applied 24-48 hours before chemotherapy.  The patch should be kept on for at least 24 hours after chemotherapy and can remain in place for up to 7 days.
* **Subcutaneous (SubQ):** 10 mg administered at least 30 minutes before moderately emetogenic chemotherapy or anthracycline and cyclophosphamide combination chemotherapy.  This is often given in conjunction with dexamethasone, and the exact dexamethasone dose will be determined by your doctor. It's usually administered only on day 1 of chemotherapy and not more frequently than once every 7 days.


**Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting:**

* **Oral:** 2 mg one hour before radiation treatment.

**Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV):**

* **Intravenous (IV):** 1 mg given as an undiluted push over 30 seconds either before anesthesia induction or immediately before the reversal of anesthesia.  For treatment of existing nausea and vomiting, the same dose is administered.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and efficacy of oral granisetron have not been established in children. Intravenous administration may be used in children aged 2-16 years, but the dosage is the same as for adults.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance on pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific guidance.

* Changes in taste (dysgeusia)
* Indigestion (dyspepsia)
* Anemia
* Low white blood cell count (leukopenia)
* Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)

* Agitation
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Insomnia
* Fever
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Various cardiac arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above as serious or unusual, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Granisetron works by blocking the action of serotonin (5-HT3) at specific receptors in the brain and gut. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter involved in triggering nausea and vomiting, particularly in response to chemotherapy and radiation. By blocking serotonin's effect at these receptors, granisetron prevents the signals that lead to nausea and vomiting.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Granisetron is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components and should not be used concurrently with apomorphine.
* **Interactions:**  Granisetron may interact with other drugs, particularly those affecting the serotonin system (SSRIs, SNRIs) or those that prolong the QT interval on the ECG. Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Warnings:** Granisetron may prolong the QT interval, increasing the risk of potentially fatal heart rhythm disturbances.  This is particularly important in patients with pre-existing heart conditions.  Use caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and neonates.  Monitor for constipation and signs of serotonin syndrome.  Subcutaneous administration may cause injection site reactions.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store granisetron?** A:  Storage instructions vary depending on the formulation. Follow the instructions on the medication label. Generally, it should be stored at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I take granisetron with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you're taking before starting granisetron.  Some medications may interact with it.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Is granisetron safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  Granisetron is categorized as Pregnancy Category B, meaning animal studies have not shown risk to the fetus, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The decision to use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, weighing the potential benefits against the risks.

* **Q:  How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action depends on the administration route, but generally, it starts working within a short period before or after the emetogenic stimulus (chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery).
