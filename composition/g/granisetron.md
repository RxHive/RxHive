# Granisetron

**Generic Name:** Granisetron

**Usage:**

Granisetron is used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by:

* **Chemotherapy:**  It's frequently prescribed to patients undergoing cancer treatment with chemotherapy drugs, which are known to induce severe nausea and vomiting.
* **Radiation therapy:**  It can also be used to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis.
* **Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV):**  It can help prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery.


**Side Effects:**

Granisetron is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:** Headache, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue.
* **Less common side effects:**  Dry mouth, diarrhea, abdominal pain, blurred vision.
* **Rare but serious side effects:**  Prolonged QT interval (a heart rhythm abnormality),  allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing).

**It is crucial to note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent.


**How it Works:**

Granisetron is a selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of serotonin (a neurotransmitter) at specific receptors in the brain and gastrointestinal tract.  Serotonin is involved in the vomiting reflex, and by blocking its action at these receptors, granisetron prevents nausea and vomiting.
