# Ginkgo
### Generic Name
Ginkgo biloba

### Usage
Ginkgo biloba, commonly known as ginkgo or maidenhair tree, is primarily used in standardized leaf extract form. Its applications are diverse, although evidence supporting efficacy varies across conditions.  Primary uses include potentially improving cognitive function, particularly in cases of dementia, and alleviating symptoms of intermittent claudication (pain in the legs due to poor circulation).  Secondary or investigational uses include the prevention of altitude sickness, management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), treatment of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, vertigo and tinnitus, Raynaud's disease, and normal-tension glaucoma. It's crucial to understand that the effectiveness of ginkgo biloba in these secondary applications remains a subject of ongoing research.  Always consult a healthcare professional to determine its suitability for your specific condition.

### Dosage
Dosage for ginkgo biloba extract varies widely depending on the specific condition being treated and the product formulation.  There is no universally standardized dosage.  Always follow the instructions on the specific product you are using or those given by your healthcare provider. The following are examples of dosages found in studies, *not recommendations*:

* **Altitude sickness (prevention):**  80 mg twice daily (BID) orally.
* **Cognitive function:** 120-600 mg/day, often divided into two or more doses (BID or TID).
* **Dementia; intermittent claudication:** 120-240 mg/day, often divided into two or three doses (BID or TID).
* **Premenstrual syndrome (PMS):** 80 mg BID, starting on day 16 of the menstrual cycle and continuing until day 5 of the next cycle.
* **SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction:** 60-240 mg BID.
* **Vertigo/tinnitus:** 120-160 mg/day, often divided into two or three doses (BID or TID).
* **Raynaud's disease:** 360 mg/day in three divided doses (TID).
* **Normal-tension glaucoma:** 40 mg TID for four weeks.

These are examples; consult a healthcare professional for personalized dosage advice.  The preparation (e.g., extract standardization) also significantly impacts dosage.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of ginkgo biloba are generally mild. However, they can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Palpitations
* Skin rash
* Itching (pruritis)
* Allergic reactions


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include bleeding disorders and convulsions.  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Ginkgo biloba extracts contain flavonoid glycosides and terpenoids (ginkgolides and bilobalides). The flavonoid glycosides act as antioxidants and reduce capillary fragility, improving blood flow. The ginkgolides inhibit platelet-activating factor (PAF), a substance involved in inflammation and blood clotting. By improving blood flow and reducing inflammation, ginkgo biloba may alleviate symptoms in conditions such as intermittent claudication and potentially enhance cognitive function.  The precise mechanisms of action in all conditions are not fully understood.

### Precautions
* **Bleeding disorders:**  Ginkgo biloba has antiplatelet effects and can increase bleeding risk. It should be avoided or used with extreme caution by individuals with bleeding disorders or those taking anticoagulants (blood thinners) or antiplatelet medications (like aspirin).
* **Surgery:** Discontinue ginkgo biloba at least two weeks prior to any scheduled surgery due to its potential to prolong bleeding time.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Avoid ginkgo biloba during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  There is insufficient information about its safety during these periods.
* **Drug interactions:** Ginkgo biloba may interact with several medications, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and certain antidepressants. Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications and supplements you are taking before starting ginkgo biloba.
* **Seizure disorders:** Use caution in patients with seizure disorders as ginkgo biloba may lower the seizure threshold.
* **Diabetes:**  Use caution in patients with diabetes as ginkgo may affect blood sugar levels.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from ginkgo biloba?** A: The time it takes to notice effects varies depending on the condition and individual response. It may take several weeks or even months for some conditions.
* **Q: Can I take ginkgo biloba with other supplements or medications?** A: It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking, to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: How should I store ginkgo biloba?** A: Store ginkgo biloba in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as directed on the product label.
* **Q: Is ginkgo biloba safe for everyone?** A: While generally considered safe when used as directed, ginkgo biloba may not be suitable for everyone. Individuals with certain health conditions or those taking specific medications should consult their healthcare provider before use.  Furthermore, avoid consuming the raw seeds and fruit pulp, as they are toxic.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose of ginkgo biloba?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider or on the product label.
