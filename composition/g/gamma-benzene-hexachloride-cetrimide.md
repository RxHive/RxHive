# Gamma Benzene Hexachloride + Cetrimide
### Generic Name
Gamma Benzene Hexachloride + Cetrimide

**Note:** This combination is not a single, universally recognized generic medicine with a standardized name.  The combination of gamma benzene hexachloride (lindane) and cetrimide is used in certain topical formulations, often for treating scabies and other parasitic infestations.  The information below reflects the properties of this combination, understanding that specific product formulations may vary slightly.  Always refer to the product's individual labeling for accurate information.


### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used topically to treat parasitic skin infestations, most notably scabies.  Gamma benzene hexachloride (lindane) is a potent insecticide that acts against the scabies mite (*Sarcoptes scabiei*). Cetrimide is a quaternary ammonium compound with antiseptic properties that helps to clean the skin and reduce secondary bacterial infections often associated with scabies. While lindane is the main active ingredient targeting the parasite, cetrimide plays a supportive role in improving overall skin health and reducing the risk of complications.  It is crucial to note that due to concerns regarding neurological side effects, lindane-containing products are less commonly prescribed than in the past, and alternative treatments are often preferred.


### Dosage
Dosage instructions vary significantly depending on the specific formulation and the age and weight of the patient.  **It is absolutely crucial to follow the instructions provided by a healthcare professional and the product labeling.**  There are no standard oral or IV administrations for this combination; it is applied topically only.  Typical application involves applying a thin layer of the cream or lotion to the affected areas of the skin, ensuring complete coverage. The duration of treatment is usually dictated by the healthcare provider and depends on the severity of the infestation.  Children and individuals with neurological conditions or liver impairment are at higher risk of adverse effects and require careful monitoring and potentially alternative treatments.


### Side Effects
* **Common:** Skin irritation (itching, burning, redness), dryness, allergic reactions.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Neurological symptoms (headache, dizziness, seizures, tremors, convulsions), liver problems (jaundice, elevated liver enzymes).  These are more likely with lindane.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Rashes, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing.

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works
Gamma benzene hexachloride (lindane) works by disrupting the nervous system of the scabies mite, leading to its paralysis and death.  It binds to chloride channels in the mite's nerve cells, disrupting nerve impulses and causing paralysis. Cetrimide, being an antiseptic, kills bacteria and reduces the risk of secondary infections on the skin, contributing to faster healing and reduced discomfort.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Lindane is contraindicated in pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, infants, children under 2 years of age, individuals with a history of seizures or neurological disorders, and those with impaired liver function.
* **Drug Interactions:**  The interaction of this combination with other medications is not extensively documented, but caution should be exercised when using it concurrently with other topical agents. Consult a healthcare provider.
* **Warnings:** Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Wash hands thoroughly after application. Do not use excessively or for prolonged periods.  Do not reapply without consulting a healthcare professional.
* **Vulnerable Groups:**  This combination carries a significantly higher risk for infants, children, pregnant/breastfeeding women, and individuals with compromised liver or neurological function.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effectiveness varies, but typically, significant improvement in symptoms should be seen within a few days of starting treatment, though complete eradication of the infestation may take longer.
* **Q: Can I use this on my face?** A:  Generally, no.  Follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional. The product label will also clearly indicate which body areas are appropriate for application.
