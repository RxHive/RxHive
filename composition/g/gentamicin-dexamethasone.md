# Gentamicin + Dexamethasone

**Generic Name:** Gentamicin Sulfate and Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate

**Usage:**

This combination medication is used to treat various bacterial infections, particularly those affecting the ear (otitis externa or otitis media), eye (conjunctivitis), and skin.  It's crucial to understand that it only works against bacteria; it's ineffective against viruses or fungi.  The specific bacterial infections it treats depend on the susceptibility of the bacteria to gentamicin.  A doctor prescribes this medication based on the specific infection and the sensitivity of the bacteria to the antibiotic.  The medication is often used in topical (ear drops, eye drops, ointments) or injection forms, not usually for oral administration.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects vary depending on the route of administration and the individual.  Common side effects may include:

* **Topical (ear drops, eye drops, ointments):** Burning, stinging, or itching at the application site.  Rarely, allergic reactions (rash, swelling).  Long-term use can lead to secondary infections (due to alteration of normal flora).
* **Injection:**  More serious side effects are possible with injection, including:
    * **Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity):**  This is a serious risk, particularly with prolonged use or in patients with pre-existing kidney problems.  Monitor for decreased urine output, changes in urine color, swelling, and fatigue.
    * **Hearing loss (ototoxicity):**  This can be temporary or permanent and can affect both high-frequency and low-frequency hearing.  Monitor for tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dizziness, or hearing problems.
    * **Nerve damage (neuropathy):**  Symptoms can include numbness, tingling, or weakness.
    * **Allergic reactions:**  These can range from mild rashes to severe anaphylaxis.
    * **Increased blood sugar:**  Dexamethasone can elevate blood sugar levels.


**How it Works:**

* **Gentamicin:** This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It works by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacteria, ultimately killing them. It's bactericidal, meaning it directly kills bacteria.
* **Dexamethasone:** This is a corticosteroid (a type of steroid). It reduces inflammation and swelling, thereby helping to alleviate symptoms associated with the infection. It doesn't kill bacteria but helps control the inflammatory response to the infection.  The combination allows for both bacterial eradication (gentamicin) and symptom relief (dexamethasone).
