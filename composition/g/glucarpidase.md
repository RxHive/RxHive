# Glucarpidase
### Generic Name
Glucarpidase

### Usage
Glucarpidase is a medication used to treat high levels of methotrexate in the blood.  Methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various cancers and autoimmune diseases.  Sometimes, methotrexate stays in the body longer than expected, leading to dangerously high levels and potentially serious side effects. Glucarpidase helps lower these high methotrexate levels by breaking it down into less harmful substances.  It's primarily used in adults and children with delayed methotrexate clearance due to impaired kidney function.  It's crucial to understand that Glucarpidase is *not* routinely used to prevent high methotrexate levels; it's reserved for cases where dangerously high levels have already developed.

### Dosage

**Methotrexate Toxicity (Adults and Children):** The typical dose is 50 units/kg given intravenously (IV) as a single dose.  This should ideally be administered within 48-60 hours of the start of the high-dose methotrexate infusion.  Giving it later may not prevent life-threatening toxicity.  A second dose within 48 hours of the first is not recommended during the same methotrexate course due to decreased effectiveness. If a full 50 units/kg dose is unavailable, administer whatever amount is available; lower doses may still be beneficial.  Always provide supportive care along with Glucarpidase.

**Specific Considerations for Timing of Methotrexate Administration:** The need for Glucarpidase is determined by methotrexate blood levels and kidney function, specifically:

* **Methotrexate infusion â‰¤6 hours:** Significantly elevated serum creatinine relative to baseline AND a 24-hour plasma methotrexate level >50 micromolar, OR a 36-hour level >30 micromolar, OR a 42-hour level >10 micromolar, OR a 48-hour level >5 micromolar.
* **Methotrexate infusion of 24 hours:** Significantly elevated serum creatinine relative to baseline AND a 36-hour plasma methotrexate level >30 micromolar, OR a 42-hour level >10 micromolar, OR a 48-hour level >5 micromolar.
* **Methotrexate infusion of 36-42 hours:** Significantly elevated serum creatinine relative to baseline AND a 48-hour plasma methotrexate level >5 micromolar.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for liver or kidney impairment.

**Concurrent Leucovorin:**  If using leucovorin calcium (a medication that helps counter methotrexate's effects), administer it at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after the Glucarpidase dose.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Development of antibodies (immunologic reaction)

**Less Common but Possible Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Flushing
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)

**Rare or Post-Marketing Side Effects (occurring in less than 1% of patients or reported after the drug's release):**

* Blurred vision
* Diarrhea
* Hypersensitivity reactions (severe allergic reactions)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Pharyngeal edema (swelling in the throat)
* Skin rash
* Throat irritation
* Tremor


If you experience any side effects, especially severe ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Glucarpidase is an enzyme.  It works by breaking down methotrexate, a drug that can build up to toxic levels in the body.  Glucarpidase specifically targets methotrexate, splitting it into smaller, less harmful metabolites (DAMPA and glutamate).  This process reduces the amount of active methotrexate in the bloodstream, irrespective of kidney function, thereby lowering the risk of methotrexate toxicity.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  There's an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions (severe allergic reactions).
* **Drug Interactions:** Glucarpidase can decrease the effectiveness of several other drugs, including folic acid, leucovorin, pemetrexed, and others.  Avoid concurrent use unless specifically directed by a doctor.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Glucarpidase is in pregnancy category C, meaning the risk to the developing fetus isn't fully known.  Its use during pregnancy should be carefully considered, balancing potential benefits against potential risks.  It's unknown whether Glucarpidase passes into breast milk.
* **Monitoring:** Closely monitor methotrexate levels (using a chromatographic method for up to 48 hours after Glucarpidase administration, as other tests may be inaccurate), complete blood count, liver function tests, and kidney function tests.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Glucarpidase administered?** A: It's given intravenously (IV) over 5 minutes. The IV line should be flushed before and after administration.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: It rapidly reduces methotrexate levels, but the exact timeframe varies depending on individual factors.
* **Q: Can I take Glucarpidase at home?** A: No, Glucarpidase is typically administered in a hospital or clinical setting under medical supervision.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  This isn't applicable as it is typically given as a single dose for an acute situation. Contact your doctor immediately if you have concerns about your methotrexate levels.
* **Q: How is Glucarpidase stored?** A: Refer to the specific storage instructions on the medication packaging.
* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects?** A: The long-term effects of Glucarpidase are not extensively studied as it is used for acute situations.  Your doctor can discuss any concerns.
