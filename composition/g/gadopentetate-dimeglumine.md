# Gadopentetate Dimeglumine
### Generic Name
Gadopentetate Dimeglumine

### Usage

Gadopentetate dimeglumine is a gadolinium-based contrast agent used primarily with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.  Its main purpose is to improve the visualization of lesions (abnormal areas of tissue) in various parts of the body, particularly those with abnormal blood vessel growth.  This includes lesions in the brain, spine, and associated tissues, as well as lesions in other areas of the head and neck and the body.  The enhanced visualization helps doctors better diagnose and assess these lesions.

### Dosage

**Adults and Children (2 years and older):**  The typical intravenous (IV) dose is 0.2 mL/kg (0.1 mmol/kg) of body weight. The injection rate should not exceed 10 mL every 15 seconds.  Dosage for individuals weighing over 286 lbs (approximately 130 kg) has not been established.  The same dosage applies to children aged 2 years and older.  **Note:** Safety and efficacy have not been established in children under 2 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed as gadopentetate dimeglumine doesn't undergo significant metabolism in the liver.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) above 30 mL/min/1.73 m², no dosage adjustment is specified, but caution is advised as the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) increases with decreasing kidney function.  If GFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², gadopentetate dimeglumine is contraindicated.  For patients on hemodialysis, prompt hemodialysis after administration (within 3 hours) should be considered. Peritoneal dialysis is less effective in removing gadolinium.


### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Sensation of cold
* Dizziness
* Nausea

**Less Common (less than 1%, post-marketing reports):**  A wide range of less frequent side effects have been reported, including:  allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), injection site reactions,  renal problems (including renal failure),  and in rare cases, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).  This is not an exhaustive list.

**Serious Side Effects:**  Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition characterized by fibrosis (scarring) of the skin and other organs. It is particularly important to note that NSF is more likely to develop in patients with impaired kidney function.  Any severe or unusual reaction requires immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Gadopentetate dimeglumine is a paramagnetic contrast agent.  This means it alters the magnetic properties of the surrounding tissues when placed in a magnetic field.  This alteration enhances the signal detected by the MRI scanner, improving the visibility of blood vessels and lesions with abnormal vascularity, making them more distinct from normal tissue on the images.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Severe hypersensitivity to gadopentetate dimeglumine or any component of the formulation.
* Chronic severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²).
* Acute kidney injury.
* Use in neonates (up to 4 weeks of age) due to immature renal function.

**Warnings:**

* Increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), hypersensitivity reactions, gadolinium retention, renal failure, and injection site reactions.
* Use with caution in patients with a history of allergic reactions, asthma, or renal impairment.
* Careful interpretation of contrast-enhanced scans is necessary, ideally in conjunction with non-contrast MRI.


### FAQs

**Q: How is gadopentetate dimeglumine stored?**  A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions on the product label. Typically, it involves storing it at room temperature and protecting it from light.

**Q: Can I take other medications while receiving gadopentetate dimeglumine?** A: Inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements, as some interactions are possible, though none are specifically listed by the manufacturer.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially severe ones, to your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

**Q:  Is gadopentetate dimeglumine safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  Gadopentetate dimeglumine is classified as pregnancy category C, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are not fully known.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so a discussion with your doctor is crucial to weigh the benefits and risks of using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
