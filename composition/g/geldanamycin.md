# Geldanamycin
### Generic Name
Geldanamycin

### Usage

Geldanamycin is an antibiotic with antineoplastic properties, meaning it can inhibit the growth of tumors.  Its primary use is in cancer research and preclinical studies, targeting various cancers by interfering with the function of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90).  While it shows promise in laboratory and animal settings, its clinical application is severely limited due to significant toxicity. It's not currently approved for widespread clinical use in humans.


### Dosage

Because Geldanamycin is not approved for general clinical use, there are no established dosage recommendations for humans.  Research studies using this compound employ varying doses depending on the specific research model and objectives.  These dosages are determined and strictly controlled within the context of clinical trials and are not applicable to self-medication.


### Side Effects

Geldanamycin's significant toxicity prevents its widespread use.  Common side effects observed in preclinical studies include:

* **Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):** This is a major concern and can be severe.
* **Anemia:**  Due to the induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death) in red blood cells.
* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported.
* **Other potential side effects:**  The full spectrum of potential side effects is not fully characterized due to the limited clinical use.


**Serious Side Effects:**  Any signs of liver dysfunction (jaundice, abdominal pain, dark urine) or severe anemia require immediate medical attention.  Geldanamycin's use is only appropriate under strict medical supervision in a research setting.


### How it Works

Geldanamycin works by binding to and inhibiting heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90).  Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone protein crucial for the proper folding, stability, and function of numerous proteins, including many involved in cancer development and progression.  By inhibiting Hsp90, Geldanamycin prevents these oncogenic proteins from functioning correctly. This leads to their degradation by the cell's natural waste disposal system (proteasome), effectively reducing their activity and hindering tumor growth.


### Precautions

* **Severe Hepatotoxicity:** This is the most significant concern.  Liver function tests are crucial before, during, and after any exposure to Geldanamycin.
* **Myelosuppression:** Geldanamycin can suppress bone marrow function, leading to anemia.  Regular blood monitoring is necessary.
* **Drug Interactions:** Interactions with other medications are possible but not fully characterized due to limited clinical use. Consultation with a physician or pharmacist is imperative before co-administering any drugs.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Geldanamycin is contraindicated in pregnant and breastfeeding women due to the potential for harm to the fetus or infant.
* **Children and Older Adults:**  The safety and efficacy of Geldanamycin in children and older adults haven't been established.

**Critical Safety Measure:**  Geldanamycin should only be used under strict medical supervision within a controlled research setting.  It is not available for general use and should never be self-administered.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is Geldanamycin available as a prescription drug?**  A: No, Geldanamycin is not approved for general clinical use due to significant toxicity.

* **Q: How is Geldanamycin stored?** A: Specific storage requirements would depend on the research setting and formulation.  Generally, it needs to be stored under controlled conditions to maintain stability.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Geldanamycin?** A: Long-term effects are not fully understood due to its limited clinical use and high toxicity.

* **Q: Can I buy Geldanamycin over the counter?** A: No, you cannot buy Geldanamycin without a prescription, and even then, it's not currently available through standard prescription channels.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Immediately contact a healthcare professional if you experience any adverse effects after being exposed to Geldanamycin in a research setting.
