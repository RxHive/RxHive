# Galcanezumab
### Generic Name
Galcanezumab

### Usage

Galcanezumab is a medication primarily used for the preventive treatment of migraine headaches in adults.  It's also approved for preventing episodic cluster headaches in adults.  This means it's designed to reduce the frequency and severity of these headache types, not to treat an individual headache episode as it occurs.  It doesn't offer immediate relief from a current headache.

### Dosage

**Migraine Prevention (Adults):** The initial dose is 240 mg given subcutaneously (under the skin) as two 120 mg injections, one immediately after the other. This is a loading dose.  Following this, a maintenance dose of 120 mg is given subcutaneously once monthly.

**Episodic Cluster Headache Prevention (Adults):**  Treatment begins with a 300 mg loading dose given subcutaneously as three 100 mg injections, one after the other, at the start of a cluster period.  Then, 100 mg is administered subcutaneously once monthly until the cluster period ends.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of galcanezumab in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are currently recommended based on hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment according to the manufacturer's labeling.  Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)
* Development of antibodies against galcanezumab (immunogenicity)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (including difficulty breathing, rash, and hives).  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.

It's crucial to report any side effects to your doctor or pharmacist.  This list is not exhaustive, and other side effects may occur.

### How it Works

Galcanezumab is a monoclonal antibody. It works by binding to and blocking calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a molecule believed to play a significant role in migraine and cluster headache development. By preventing CGRP from activating its receptors, galcanezumab helps reduce the frequency and intensity of these headache types.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Galcanezumab is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity (severe allergic reaction) to galcanezumab or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:** There's an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including breathing difficulties, rash, and hives.  
* **Caution:** Use caution in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (heart disease), stroke, unstable angina, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, intracranial or carotid aneurysms, intracranial hemorrhage, vasospastic angina, Raynaud's disease, or peripheral vascular disease.  Your doctor should carefully assess your risk before prescribing galcanezumab.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of galcanezumab during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Drug Interactions:** Galcanezumab may increase the levels and effects of belimumab.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
