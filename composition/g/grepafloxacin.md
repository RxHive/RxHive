# Grepafloxacin
### Generic Name
Grepafloxacin

### Usage
Grepafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic.  It was previously used to treat various bacterial infections, including:

* **Exacerbations of chronic bronchitis:**  Specifically those caused by susceptible bacteria like *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, and *Moraxella catarrhalis*.
* **Community-acquired pneumonia:**  Pneumonia acquired outside of hospital settings.
* **Gonorrhea:** A sexually transmitted infection.
* **Nongonococcal urethritis and cervicitis:**  Infections of the urethra (in men) and cervix (in women).


**Important Note:**  Grepafloxacin is no longer available on the market due to concerns about its potential to prolong the QT interval on electrocardiograms (ECGs), increasing the risk of serious cardiovascular events, including sudden death.

### Dosage
Dosage information for grepafloxacin is not provided here because the medication is no longer available.  Any information found elsewhere should be considered outdated and unsafe to follow.  Never take medication based on outdated information.

### Side Effects
Because grepafloxacin is no longer available, detailed side effect information based on current use is unavailable. However, it is known that the drug could cause:

* **Common side effects:**  These varied but could include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and headache.  The full range is not completely documented due to the drug's withdrawal.
* **Serious but less common side effects:**  The most concerning side effect was the prolongation of the QT interval on ECGs, leading to a risk of potentially fatal heart rhythm abnormalities.  Other less common serious side effects might have included allergic reactions, such as skin rashes or anaphylaxis.

**If you experienced side effects from grepafloxacin in the past, consult your doctor or pharmacist.**


### How it Works
Grepafloxacin works by inhibiting two bacterial enzymes crucial for DNA replication, transcription, and repair: topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV.  By blocking these enzymes, grepafloxacin prevents bacterial cells from multiplying and ultimately leads to their death.


### Precautions
**Grepafloxacin is no longer available and should not be used.**  Given its withdrawal from the market due to serious cardiovascular risks, any previous precautions are now moot.  Using information related to its precautions from outdated sources is strongly discouraged.
