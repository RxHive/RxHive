# Gabapentin + Nortriptyline

It's important to understand that **Gabapentin and Nortriptyline are two separate drugs** often prescribed together, but not as a single combined medication.  There's no generic "Gabapentin + Nortriptyline" formulation.  A doctor might prescribe them concurrently to treat certain conditions. Therefore, the information below will address each drug individually and then briefly discuss their combined use.

    * Neuropathic pain (nerve pain)
    * Epilepsy (seizures)
    * Restless legs syndrome
* **Side Effects:** Common side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and swelling in the hands and feet.  More serious, though rare, side effects can include allergic reactions.
* **How it Works:** The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's believed to work by affecting the release of certain neurotransmitters in the brain and spinal cord, thus reducing nerve pain and seizure activity.
* **FAQs:**

**Gabapentin + Nortriptyline (Combined Use)**

Doctors might prescribe Gabapentin and Nortriptyline together, most commonly for managing neuropathic pain that hasn't responded adequately to either drug alone.  The combination aims to leverage the different mechanisms of action of each drug to provide better pain relief.  However, this combination can increase the risk of side effects, particularly drowsiness and dizziness.  The doctor will carefully monitor the patient and adjust dosages as needed.
