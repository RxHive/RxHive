# Gatifloxacin
### Generic Name
Gatifloxacin

### Usage

Gatifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used topically in the eye. Its primary use is in treating bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye), a common bacterial infection of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye.  While not its primary indication, it's also sometimes used off-label to treat bacterial keratitis, a more serious infection of the cornea (the clear front part of the eye).  Use of gatifloxacin for keratitis should only be under the direct supervision of an ophthalmologist due to the severity of the condition.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the concentration of the gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution. Always follow your doctor's or ophthalmologist's instructions carefully.

**Bacterial Conjunctivitis:**

* **Adults and Children â‰¥1 year:**  The dosage for 0.3% and 0.5% solutions differs. Refer to your prescription for the exact regimen. Generally, initial treatment involves frequent instillations (e.g., every 2 hours) for the first 1-2 days, followed by a reduction in frequency as the infection improves (e.g., 4 times a day). The total treatment duration is usually 7 days.


**Bacterial Keratitis (off-label use):**

* **Adults:** Treatment usually begins with frequent instillations (every hour) of a 0.5% solution until initial healing is observed (48-72 hours). The frequency is then gradually reduced as the ulcer heals, under the direct guidance of an ophthalmologist.


**Administration:**  For all uses, gently pull down the lower eyelid, tilt your head back, and instill the prescribed number of drops into the affected eye(s). Avoid touching the tip of the dropper to any surface to prevent contamination. After instillation, gently press on the inner corner of the eye (lacrimal sac) for 1-2 minutes to minimize systemic absorption of the medication.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Eye irritation, redness, burning, itching
* Eye discharge
* Chemosis (swelling of the conjunctiva)
* Altered taste (dysgeusia)
* Conjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding in the conjunctiva)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, hives)
* Blurred vision
* Corneal edema (swelling of the cornea)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a rare but serious skin reaction)


If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, contact your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.


### How it Works

Gatifloxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic.  It works by interfering with the enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair.  By inhibiting these enzymes, gatifloxacin prevents the bacteria from multiplying and eventually leads to their death. This action effectively combats the bacterial infection causing conjunctivitis or keratitis.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Gatifloxacin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to gatifloxacin, other fluoroquinolones, or any components of the formulation.
* **Superinfection:**  Like all antibiotics, gatifloxacin can cause the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms (fungi or other bacteria).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Gatifloxacin is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its effects are unknown. It should be used only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. The excretion of gatifloxacin in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Contact Lenses:** Avoid wearing contact lenses if you have symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Gatifloxacin can interact with other medications, including antacids, calcium salts, and certain other drugs that can affect its absorption or activity. Inform your doctor or ophthalmologist about all other medications you are currently taking.
* **Children:**  Use in children under 1 year of age is generally not recommended.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for gatifloxacin to work?**  A: You may start to notice improvement within a few days, but the full course of treatment (usually 7 days) should be completed to ensure the infection is completely cleared.

* **Q: Can I use gatifloxacin for viral conjunctivitis?** A: No, gatifloxacin is only effective against bacterial infections.  Viral conjunctivitis requires different treatment.

* **Q: How should I store gatifloxacin eye drops?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I use gatifloxacin in both eyes if only one eye is infected?** A:  Only use gatifloxacin in the affected eye(s) unless specifically instructed otherwise by your doctor.
