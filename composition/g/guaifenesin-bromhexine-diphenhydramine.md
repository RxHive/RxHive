# Guaifenesin + Bromhexine + Diphenhydramine

**Generic Name:** Guaifenesin + Bromhexine + Diphenhydramine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat symptoms of the common cold or the flu.  It's specifically designed to address several symptoms simultaneously:

* **Guaifenesin:**  A expectorant that helps loosen and thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.
* **Bromhexine:**  Another expectorant that also helps thin mucus.  It may be more effective in producing a wet cough which is easier to clear compared to a dry cough.
* **Diphenhydramine:** An antihistamine that helps dry up runny noses and reduce sneezing. It also possesses mild sedative properties.


The combination is typically used for relieving symptoms such as:

* Cough (both productive and non-productive, though more effective on productive coughs)
* Runny nose
* Sneezing
* Congestion


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a particularly common side effect due to the diphenhydramine.
* **Dry mouth:**  Also a common antihistamine side effect.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be caused by any of the three components.
* **Nausea:**  Less common but possible.
* **Headache:** Less common but possible.
* **Constipation:** Less common but possible.
* **Blurred vision:** Less common but possible, especially with higher doses.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions such as skin rash, itching, or swelling are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience an allergic reaction.


**How it Works:**

* **Guaifenesin:** Increases the flow of fluid into the airways, thereby thinning the mucus and making it easier to cough up.
* **Bromhexine:**  Works similarly to guaifenesin but may have a slightly different mechanism of action in thinning the mucus.
* **Diphenhydramine:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction or infection, which is responsible for many cold and flu symptoms like runny nose, sneezing and itching. It also has a mild sedative effect by blocking the action of acetylcholine in the brain.
