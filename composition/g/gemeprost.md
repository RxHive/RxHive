# Gemeprost
### Generic Name
Gemeprost

### Usage
Gemeprost is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analogue primarily used for two distinct purposes: inducing abortion (termination of pregnancy) and cervical ripening.

* **Induction of Abortion:** Gemeprost is used to induce abortion, particularly in later stages of pregnancy (second trimester).  It works by causing contractions of the uterus, leading to the expulsion of the pregnancy.

* **Cervical Ripening:** Before certain surgical procedures to terminate pregnancy in the first trimester, gemeprost is used to soften and dilate the cervix, making the procedure easier and potentially safer.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the intended use and the patient's condition.  Gemeprost is typically administered vaginally as a pessary.  **It is crucial to follow the instructions provided by a healthcare professional precisely.**  The following are general guidelines and should not replace personalized medical advice.

* **Induction of Abortion (Second Trimester):**  1 mg pessary vaginally every 3 hours, up to a maximum total dose of 5 mg per course.  A second course may be administered 24 hours after the first course if necessary.

* **Cervical Ripening (First Trimester, before surgical termination):** 1 mg pessary inserted into the posterior fornix of the vagina 3 hours before the planned procedure.


* **Intrauterine Fetal Death:** 1 mg pessary vaginally every 3 hours, up to a maximum total dose of 5 mg per course.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment. Gemeprost is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Abnormal vaginal bleeding
* Uterine pain
* Diarrhea

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Chills
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Myasthenia (muscle weakness)
* Chest pain
* Coronary artery vasospasm
* Flushing
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Palpitations
* Severe hypotension
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Lower abdominal pain
* Uterine rupture
* Back pain
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Fever

**If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Gemeprost works by mimicking the actions of naturally occurring prostaglandins in the body.  Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that play a vital role in various bodily functions, including uterine contractions.  Gemeprost specifically stimulates the muscles of the uterus to contract, increasing their strength and frequency. This helps expel the pregnancy in cases of induced abortion.  In cervical ripening, it softens and dilates the cervix, making it more pliable.  The medication also decreases blood flow to the uterus and placenta.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Gemeprost is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to gemeprost or related components; unexplained vaginal bleeding; uterine fragility (e.g., due to uterine scarring); placenta previa (placenta covering the cervix); renal impairment; or for inducing labor or cervical ripening at term.

* **Increased Risk:**  Use of gemeprost increases the risk of uterine rupture, serious cardiac effects, and spontaneous abortion when used for cervical ripening before transcervical intrauterine procedures.

* **Use with Caution:** Use with caution in patients with obstructive airway disease, cardiovascular insufficiency, elevated intraocular pressure, cervicitis, or vaginitis.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Gemeprost should not be used to induce labor.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, use with caution during breastfeeding.

* **Drug Interactions:** Gemeprost may enhance the effects of oxytocin and other oxytocic drugs (drugs that stimulate uterine contractions).


### FAQs
