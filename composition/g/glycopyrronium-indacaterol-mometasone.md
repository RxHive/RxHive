# Glycopyrronium + Indacaterol + Mometasone

**Generic Name:** Glycopyrronium/Indacaterol/Mometasone

**Usage:**  This triple combination medication is a long-acting bronchodilator and corticosteroid inhaler used to prevent and treat airflow obstruction in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It's used for patients whose symptoms are not adequately controlled with a long-acting bronchodilator alone or who are already using a combination of a long-acting bronchodilator and an inhaled corticosteroid.  It is **not** typically used for asthma.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Glycopyrronium related:** Dry mouth, constipation, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary retention (difficulty urinating), blurred vision.
* **Indacaterol related:** Headache, throat irritation, upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia.
* **Mometasone related:**  Throat irritation, thrush (oral candidiasis), hoarse voice, headache.
* **Less common but more serious:** Increased risk of pneumonia (especially in patients with a history of pneumonia or other lung infections), paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing), increased risk of osteoporosis (long-term use), glaucoma, cataracts, skin bruising or thinning.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions including rash, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema) can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.

**How it Works:**

* **Glycopyrronium:**  This is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that causes the muscles in the airways to contract. By blocking acetylcholine, glycopyrronium helps to relax the muscles in the airways, making it easier to breathe.
* **Indacaterol:** This is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist.  It works by binding to beta2-receptors in the lungs, causing the muscles in the airways to relax and improving airflow.
* **Mometasone:** This is a corticosteroid. It reduces inflammation in the airways, reducing swelling and mucus production, thus improving lung function and reducing symptoms.

The combination of these three medications offers a synergistic effect, meaning they work better together than individually to manage COPD symptoms.  The bronchodilators (glycopyrronium and indacaterol) quickly relieve airflow obstruction, while the corticosteroid (mometasone) reduces long-term inflammation.
