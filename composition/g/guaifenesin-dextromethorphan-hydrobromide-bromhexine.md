# Guaifenesin + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Bromhexine

**Generic Name:** Guaifenesin + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Bromhexine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or other upper respiratory infections.  Specifically, it addresses:

* **Cough:** Dextromethorphan hydrobromide is a cough suppressant (antitussive) that helps reduce the urge to cough.
* **Phlegm/Mucus:** Guaifenesin is an expectorant that helps thin and loosen phlegm, making it easier to cough up. Bromhexine also acts as an expectorant, assisting in mucus clearance.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, though not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is particularly associated with dextromethorphan.
* **Nausea:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Headache:**
* **Upset stomach:**
* **Constipation:**
* **Dry mouth:**


**Less common, but more serious side effects require immediate medical attention and include:**

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Fast or irregular heartbeat
* Seizures
* Hallucinations (especially at high doses of dextromethorphan)


**How it Works:**

* **Guaifenesin:**  Increases the flow of fluid into the airways, making mucus thinner and easier to expel.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
* **Bromhexine:** Reduces the viscosity (stickiness) of mucus, making it easier to cough up.  It may also have some anti-inflammatory effects.
