# Gentamicin (Topical)
### Generic Name
Gentamicin (Topical)

### Usage
Gentamicin topical is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat a variety of superficial bacterial skin infections.  Its primary use is in the treatment of bacterial skin infections, including but not limited to: folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles), impetigo contagiosa (highly contagious bacterial skin infection), furunculosis (boils), sycosis barbae (bacterial infection of the beard area), ecthyma (ulcerative skin infection), pyoderma gangrenosum (rare, ulcerative skin condition), infectious eczematoid dermatitis, pustular acne, pustular psoriasis, infected seborrheic dermatitis or contact dermatitis, infected excoriations (skin abrasions), and bacterial superinfections of fungal or viral skin infections.  It's crucial to understand that gentamicin only targets bacterial infections; it is ineffective against viral or fungal infections.

### Dosage
The typical dosage for adults and children is the same:

**Superficial dermatologic infections:** For topical application, a 0.1% gentamicin ointment is usually applied three to four times daily to the affected area.  The area may be covered with a gauze dressing. This information is based on manufacturer's labeling; always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Erythema (redness)
* Pruritus (itching)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, are rare with topical application, but should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.  These could include allergic reactions (such as rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), or signs of a superinfection (a secondary infection occurring on top of the original infection).

Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any side effects, even those that appear minor.

### How it Works
Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that works by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria.  This disrupts the process of bacterial protein synthesis, essentially stopping the bacteria from making the proteins they need to survive and replicate. This ultimately leads to bacterial cell death and helps to clear the infection.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Gentamicin topical is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to gentamicin or any other component of the formulation.
* **Superinfection:**  There is an increased risk of superinfection (a new infection developing on top of the existing one, often by a different organism).
* **Sensitization:**  Repeated or prolonged use can lead to sensitization (allergic reaction), manifesting as increased redness and irritation at the application site.
* **External Use Only:** This medication is for external use only and should not be used in the eyes or ingested.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While the systemic absorption from topical application is generally low, pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before using gentamicin topical.
* **Children:** While the dosage is the same for children as for adults, parental supervision is essential to ensure correct application and prevent accidental ingestion.
* **Other Medications:** While less likely with topical application, inform your healthcare provider of all other medications you are taking, as interactions are possible, though less likely with topical administration than oral or injected forms.
