# Gentamicin + Hydrocortisone

**Generic Name:** Gentamicin Sulfate and Hydrocortisone Acetate

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical antibiotic and corticosteroid used to treat bacterial skin infections that are accompanied by inflammation and itching.  It's often prescribed for conditions like infected eczema, impetigo, or infected dermatitis.  The gentamicin fights the bacterial infection, while the hydrocortisone reduces inflammation, redness, swelling, and itching.  **It is crucial to note that this is only for topical use and should never be ingested.**

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild when used as directed, but can include:

* **At the application site:** Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, skin thinning, increased hair growth (hypertrichosis), changes in skin pigmentation (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation), skin irritation, allergic contact dermatitis.
* **Systemic side effects (less common but possible with prolonged use or large surface area application):**  These are more likely in children and with extensive application.  They include adrenal suppression (body's reduced production of cortisol), increased blood sugar, cataracts, glaucoma.

**How it Works:**

* **Gentamicin Sulfate:** This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, effectively killing bacteria and preventing their growth.  It's effective against a range of gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria.

* **Hydrocortisone Acetate:** This is a corticosteroid (a type of steroid) that reduces inflammation by decreasing the release of inflammatory substances in the body. This action lessens swelling, redness, itching, and pain.

The combination provides both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, addressing both the infection and the associated symptoms.


**FAQs:**

* **How long should I use this medication?**  Follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  Typically, it's used for a short period (1-2 weeks) until the infection clears. Prolonged use increases the risk of side effects.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Apply the medication as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't apply a double dose.

* **Can I use this on my face?**  Generally, it's best to avoid applying this medication to the face or other sensitive areas unless specifically instructed by your doctor.  The face absorbs medication more readily, increasing the risk of systemic side effects.

* **Can I use this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Consult your doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** If you experience any severe or persistent side effects, stop using the medication and consult your doctor immediately.
