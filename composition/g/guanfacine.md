# Guanfacine
### Generic Name
Guanfacine

### Usage
Guanfacine is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). It works by relaxing blood vessels, thus lowering blood pressure.  It's also approved for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), both as a standalone medication (monotherapy) and in combination with stimulant medications.  Importantly, note that while it's sometimes used off-label for other conditions like heroin withdrawal and migraine prophylaxis, these uses aren't supported by extensive clinical trials and should only be considered under strict medical supervision.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and the specific formulation (immediate-release or extended-release).  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  

**Hypertension (Adults):**  Immediate-release guanfacine typically starts at 1 mg at bedtime.  The dose may be increased to 2 mg after 3-4 weeks, but should not exceed 3 mg/day to minimize side effects.

**Hypertension (Children ≥12 years):** Similar to adults, immediate-release guanfacine usually begins at 1 mg at bedtime, potentially increasing to 2-3 mg after 3-4 weeks.  

**ADHD (Children ≥6 years and Adolescents ≤17 years):**  Extended-release guanfacine is commonly used.  The starting dose is usually 1 mg once daily, adjusted in increments of no more than 1 mg per week.  The target dose varies depending on weight and individual response, typically ranging from 1 to 7 mg daily.  Different dosage ranges may apply based on whether it's used as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy with stimulants.

**Important Note:** Immediate-release and extended-release formulations are not interchangeable due to differing bioavailability.  Always consult your physician for appropriate dosage adjustments when switching between formulations or if other medications are involved.  Specific dosage adjustments are also needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Sleepiness (somnolence)
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Constipation
* Fatigue
* Abdominal pain

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Low blood pressure (hypotension), particularly orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)
* Slow heart rate (bradycardia)
* Fainting (syncope)
* Skin rash, potentially severe (exfoliative dermatitis)
* Hallucinations (more common in children with ADHD)

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Guanfacine is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist.  This means it primarily binds to specific receptors in the brain and nervous system, reducing the activity of the sympathetic nervous system.  This leads to a decrease in heart rate and blood vessel constriction, lowering blood pressure. In ADHD, the exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to impact neurotransmitter activity in the brain, improving focus and attention.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Guanfacine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the medication or its components.
* **Interactions:**  Guanfacine is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4.  Therefore, medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A4 can significantly impact guanfacine levels, requiring dose adjustments. Consult your physician about potential interactions with other medications, especially CNS depressants (like alcohol).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Guanfacine is categorized as Pregnancy Category B.  However, other medications are generally preferred for hypertension during pregnancy.  It's unknown whether guanfacine is excreted in breast milk; use with caution during breastfeeding and monitor the infant for sedation.
* **Elderly and Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary for these groups due to reduced metabolism and excretion.
* **Sudden Discontinuation:** Abruptly stopping guanfacine can cause a rebound effect, leading to a rapid increase in blood pressure. Always taper off the medication under medical supervision.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take guanfacine with alcohol?** A: No, avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants as they can enhance the sedative effects of guanfacine.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor for guidance, especially if you miss more than two consecutive doses.  They may need to adjust your dosage regimen.
* **Q: How should I store guanfacine?** A: Store guanfacine as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Is guanfacine habit-forming?** A: While not considered a controlled substance in the same way as opioids, it's important to follow your doctor's prescribed dosage and not abruptly stop taking it.
* **Q:  How long does it take to see results?** A:  The time it takes to see effects can vary depending on the condition being treated and individual response.  For blood pressure, it may take several weeks to observe noticeable changes.  For ADHD, improvements in symptoms might be seen sooner.
