# Glasdegib
### Generic Name
Glasdegib

### Usage
Glasdegib is a medication used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Specifically, it's indicated for use in combination with low-dose cytarabine in adult patients newly diagnosed with AML who are 75 years or older, or who have health conditions (comorbidities) that prevent them from receiving intensive chemotherapy.  Its primary use is in this specific AML patient population where intensive treatment options aren't suitable.  There are currently no other notable secondary uses approved.


### Dosage
**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):**

* **Adults â‰¥75 years or with comorbidities:** The standard oral dose is 100 mg once daily (OD) on days 1-28 of a 28-day cycle. This is administered in combination with subcutaneous (SubQ) cytarabine 20 mg twice daily (BID) on days 1-10 of each cycle. Treatment should continue for a minimum of six cycles provided there's no unacceptable toxicity or loss of disease control.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, though mild impairment has shown to have no clinically meaningful impact on Glasdegib pharmacokinetics.  Close monitoring is advised.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For eGFR >29 mL/min, no adjustment is needed.  For eGFR 15-29 mL/min, no adjustment is recommended but close monitoring is necessary due to increased Glasdegib concentrations and higher risk of adverse effects, particularly QTc prolongation.  There are no specific dosage recommendations for eGFR <15 mL/min.
* **Toxicity Management:** Dosage adjustments depend on the type and severity of side effects.  Hematologic toxicity (low neutrophil or platelet counts) may require dose interruption or permanent discontinuation. QTc prolongation necessitates ECG monitoring and potential dose reduction or discontinuation. Other toxicities may lead to dose interruption or reduction.  Specific guidelines for dose adjustments based on toxicity are available in the full prescribing information.
* **Concomitant use with moderate CYP3A4 inducers:**  Concomitant use should be avoided if possible.  If unavoidable, the Glasdegib dose should be increased as tolerated (double the dose).  Resume the original dose 7 days after discontinuation of the CYP3A4 inducer.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of Glasdegib have not been established in pediatric patients; its use is contraindicated in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.

### How it Works
Glasdegib is a hedgehog pathway inhibitor. The hedgehog signaling pathway plays a role in cell growth and development.  Glasdegib works by binding to and inhibiting smoothened (SMO), a protein crucial in this pathway. By blocking SMO, Glasdegib prevents the activation of downstream signaling molecules that promote uncontrolled cell growth, a characteristic of AML.  This ultimately helps to control the growth of leukemia cells.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to Glasdegib or any component of the formulation.
* Children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
* Pregnancy, breastfeeding, and women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.

**Warnings:**

* **Embryo-fetal toxicity:** Glasdegib can cause serious birth defects and fetal death.  Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception, and males should use condoms during treatment and for at least 30 days afterward to prevent potential exposure through semen.
* **QTc prolongation:** Glasdegib can prolong the QTc interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), increasing the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias.  Regular ECG monitoring is necessary.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Close monitoring is required for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Glasdegib can interact with CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, and with drugs that prolong the QTc interval.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Glasdegib with food?** A: Yes, Glasdegib can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, but at least 12 hours before the next scheduled dose. Do not take two doses within 12 hours.
* **Q: How should I store Glasdegib?** A: Refer to the storage instructions on the medication label.
* **Q: Can I donate blood while taking Glasdegib?** A: No, you should not donate blood or blood products during treatment and for at least 30 days after the last dose.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Glasdegib?** A: Long-term effects are not fully known. Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is important.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Glasdegib?** A:  It is best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor, as it could potentially interact with the medication or worsen side effects.
