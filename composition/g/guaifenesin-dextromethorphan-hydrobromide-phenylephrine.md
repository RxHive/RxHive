# Guaifenesin + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine
### Generic Name
Guaifenesin + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine

### Usage

This combination medication is used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or the flu.  It's a triple-action formulation targeting several symptoms simultaneously.  

* **Guaifenesin:** This acts as an expectorant, helping to loosen and thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.  This is beneficial for relieving congestion in the chest and lungs.

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This is a cough suppressant (antitussive).  It works on the cough center in the brain to reduce the urge to cough, particularly helpful for dry, non-productive coughs.

* **Phenylephrine:** This is a decongestant that helps relieve nasal congestion by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages. This reduces swelling and allows for easier breathing.

Therefore, this combination medicine aims to address three common cold/flu symptoms:  cough, chest congestion, and nasal congestion.  It's crucial to remember that this medication treats *symptoms* and does not cure the underlying viral infection.
