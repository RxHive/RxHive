# Guaifenesin + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine

**Generic Name:** Guaifenesin + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or flu.  Specifically, it addresses:

* **Guaifenesin:**  A expectorant that helps loosen chest congestion and makes it easier to cough up mucus.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive) that reduces the urge to cough.  It's effective for coughs that are dry and unproductive (not producing mucus).
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, providing temporary relief from nasal congestion.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Some common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness or dizziness:**  Especially with dextromethorphan.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Although uncommon.
* **Headache:**
* **Insomnia:**  Especially if taken later in the day.
* **Increased blood pressure:**  More likely with phenylephrine, especially in individuals with pre-existing hypertension.
* **Nervousness or anxiety:**
* **Dry mouth:**
* **Constipation:**
* **Allergic reactions:** (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing).  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Guaifenesin:** Thins and loosens mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up. It does this by increasing the fluid content of the mucus.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.  It doesn't address the underlying cause of the cough but reduces the frequency and intensity.
* **Phenylephrine:**  Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion. This allows for easier breathing.
