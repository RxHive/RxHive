# Glecaprevir + Pibrentasvir
### Generic Name
Glecaprevir + Pibrentasvir

### Usage

Glecaprevir and Pibrentasvir is a combination medication used to treat chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.  It's effective against several genotypes of HCV (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), making it a versatile treatment option.  The drug is prescribed for both treatment-naive patients (those who haven't received HCV treatment before) and treatment-experienced patients (those who have received prior HCV therapies, potentially including interferon and ribavirin, or other direct-acting antivirals).  It's also used in liver and kidney transplant recipients with HCV, and in individuals receiving organs from donors with HCV viremia (presence of the virus in the blood).  The specific treatment duration varies depending on the patient's HCV genotype, prior treatment history, and liver health.

### Dosage

Dosage information is complex and depends heavily on several factors, including the patient's HCV genotype, treatment history (naive or experienced), liver health (presence and severity of cirrhosis), and whether they are a transplant recipient.  The medication is always taken orally, usually once daily with food.

**Adults:**  The standard dose is three 100 mg/40 mg Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir tablets once daily. The duration of treatment, however, varies greatly and ranges from 8 to 16 weeks.  Treatment-experienced patients often require longer durations (12 or 16 weeks) compared to treatment-naive patients (typically 8 weeks).  Concomitant therapy with sofosbuvir and ribavirin might be necessary in certain treatment-experienced patients, extending the treatment period to 16 weeks.  For liver or kidney transplant recipients, the treatment duration is often 12 weeks, sometimes 8 weeks for non-liver transplants.  Always refer to the most current prescribing information for exact dosage guidelines as treatment strategies are continuously evolving.

**Children:**  The medication is available for children weighing at least 45 kg or 12 years and older. The dosage is the same as for adults (three 100mg/40mg tablets once daily), but the treatment duration will vary based on the same factors described above for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A). However, the medication is contraindicated for those with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C) or a history of hepatic decompensation.  No dosage adjustment is necessary for those with renal impairment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (>10%):

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Nausea

Less common side effects (1-10%):

* Pruritus (itching)
* Diarrhea
* Increased bilirubin levels (a component of liver function tests)


Serious but less common side effects:

* Reactivation of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients co-infected with HBV (this is a significant concern and requires close monitoring).
* Acute hepatic failure
* Decompensated liver disease
* Severe hepatic disease

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Glecaprevir and Pibrentasvir work by targeting two different proteins essential for the Hepatitis C virus's life cycle.  Glecaprevir inhibits NS3/4A protease, an enzyme the virus uses to create functional viral proteins. Pibrentasvir inhibits NS5A, a protein crucial for both viral replication and assembly of new virus particles. By acting on these two distinct stages of the viral life cycle, the combination therapy effectively reduces the virus's ability to reproduce and spread.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C), a history of hepatic decompensation, and when co-administered with atazanavir or rifampin.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Glecaprevir and Pibrentasvir can interact with other medications, including statins (increased risk of myopathy), cyclosporine, ethinyl estradiol, lopinavir, rifampin, rosuvastatin, and St. John's Wort.  Discuss all medications and supplements with your doctor or pharmacist before starting this treatment.

* **Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation:** This is a serious concern for patients co-infected with both HCV and HBV.  Careful monitoring is necessary to detect and manage HBV reactivation, which can lead to serious liver damage.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Treatment is generally not recommended during pregnancy.  It's crucial to discuss family planning with your healthcare provider. The excretion of the medication in breast milk is unknown, and breastfeeding should be considered carefully alongside the benefits of the mother's treatment.  Breastfeeding is not recommended with HIV coinfection.

* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with diabetes should monitor blood glucose levels for potential hypoglycemia. Patients taking warfarin should have their INR monitored.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Glecaprevir and Pibrentasvir?** A: It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol consumption during treatment, as it can further stress the liver.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the medication as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If less than 18 hours have passed since your usual dose time, take the missed dose as soon as possible and then continue your regular dosing schedule. If more than 18 hours have passed, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the regular time.

* **Q: How long will it take to see results?** A:  The time it takes to see viral suppression varies, but your doctor will monitor your progress through regular blood tests.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.  Some are manageable, while others may require a change in treatment.
