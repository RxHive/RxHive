# Gallium Ga 68 PSMA-1
### Generic Name
Gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11

### Usage
Gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 is a radiopharmaceutical used with positron emission tomography (PET) scans.  Its primary use is in men with prostate cancer. Specifically, it helps visualize prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive lesions in patients:

* Suspected of having metastasis (cancer spread) and who are being considered for initial definitive therapy (treatment aiming for a cure).
* With suspected recurrence of prostate cancer, indicated by elevated levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in their blood.

The scan helps doctors identify the location and extent of cancer spread, guiding treatment decisions.  It's important to note that a negative scan doesn't rule out prostate cancer, and a positive scan doesn't confirm it definitively; further clinical correlation, potentially including biopsies, is usually necessary.


### Dosage

**Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan of PSMA-Positive Lesions:**

* **Adults:** The intravenous (IV) dose is 111-259 MBq (3-7 mCi).  PET scanning should begin 50-100 minutes after the injection is complete.
* **Children:**  The safety and efficacy of Gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.
* **Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting less than 1% of patients) may include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Dizziness

While rare, the potential for radiation accumulation exists.  Any adverse effects should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 is a radioactive tracer that binds to cells expressing PSMA, a protein often found on the surface of prostate cancer cells. The gallium-68 isotope emits positrons, which are detected by the PET scanner.  This allows for visualization of areas where PSMA-expressing cells are concentrated, thus identifying potential cancer sites.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  There are no contraindications listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of radiation accumulation.  
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 is not indicated for use in females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **General Considerations:** The medication should be administered as an IV bolus, potentially diluted with normal saline.  Appropriate radiation safety measures should be followed by healthcare professionals during handling and administration to minimize radiation exposure.  Patients should be well-hydrated before and after administration and should void frequently to reduce radiation exposure.  The results of the scan should be carefully interpreted in conjunction with other clinical findings.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the PET scan take after injection?**  A:  PET scanning typically begins 50-100 minutes after the injection of Gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11.

* **Q: What if I have kidney or liver problems?** A: The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for kidney or liver impairment. Discuss your medical history with your doctor.

* **Q: Is this safe during pregnancy?** A: No, this medication is not indicated for use in pregnant women.

* **Q: What are the disposal procedures?** A: Follow appropriate safety measures for handling and disposal of radioactive materials as instructed by healthcare professionals and regulatory guidelines.

* **Q: Does a negative scan mean I don't have cancer?** A: No, a negative scan doesn't exclude the possibility of prostate cancer. Further testing may be necessary.

* **Q: Is a positive scan definite proof of cancer?** A:  No, a positive scan indicates the presence of PSMA-expressing cells but requires clinical correlation with other findings to confirm the diagnosis of prostate cancer.
