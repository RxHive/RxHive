# Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin
### Generic Name
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin

### Usage

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a targeted cancer therapy used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a type of blood cancer.  It's specifically indicated for patients whose AML cells express the CD33 antigen. This means the drug only targets and affects cells carrying this specific marker, minimizing harm to healthy cells.  

The primary use is in treating both newly diagnosed and relapsed or refractory (treatment-resistant) CD33-positive AML in adults and children aged 2 years and older.  While primarily used as monotherapy (alone) or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs for AML, off-label use in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has also been reported.  However, it's crucial to discuss any off-label uses with your doctor.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on the patient's age, weight, body surface area (BSA), the type of AML (newly diagnosed versus relapsed/refractory), and whether it is used as a single agent or in combination with other treatments.  The medication is administered intravenously (IV).  Precise dosing instructions must come directly from a healthcare professional and are detailed in the prescribing information provided by the manufacturer or pharmacist.  There are different regimens for adults and children, and even further variations within those groups based on the specific treatment plan.  Some common examples include:


* **Adults, newly diagnosed AML:**  Doses range from 3 mg/m² to 6 mg/m²,  administered on multiple days within a cycle, often in combination with other chemotherapy drugs like daunorubicin and cytarabine.
* **Adults, relapsed/refractory AML:** Typically involves a dose of 3 mg/m² administered over several days.
* **Children:** Dosages are weight-based (mg/kg) and vary greatly depending on the specific treatment protocol and the child's age and BSA.  The same variation exists for monotherapy and combined therapies as in the adult protocols.

**Important:**  All doses must be carefully calculated and administered by a qualified healthcare professional under strict medical supervision.  The prescribing information should always be consulted for detailed and precise dosage instructions.  Premedication with drugs like acetaminophen and diphenhydramine is often used to minimize potential side effects.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Skin rash
* Fever
* Low blood counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia)
* Liver abnormalities (increased liver enzymes)
* Infusion reactions (allergic-type reactions during infusion)

Less common, but serious side effects, can include:

* Severe infusion reactions (requiring immediate medical attention)
* Hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage), including veno-occlusive disease (VOD)
* Cardiotoxicity (heart damage)
* Renal toxicity (kidney damage)
* Pulmonary toxicity (lung damage)
* Tumor lysis syndrome (rapid breakdown of cancer cells leading to electrolyte imbalances)

If you experience any concerning side effects, even those not listed here, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a type of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). It combines a monoclonal antibody (gemtuzumab) that specifically targets the CD33 antigen found on the surface of many AML cells with a potent cytotoxic agent (calicheamicin).

The antibody acts like a guided missile, delivering the cytotoxic payload directly to the cancer cells.  Once the antibody binds to the CD33 antigen, the complex is internalized by the AML cell. The calicheamicin is then released inside the cell, where it damages the DNA, preventing cell growth and leading to cell death (apoptosis).  This targeted approach helps reduce the damage to healthy cells.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* **Bone marrow suppression:**  This drug can significantly suppress bone marrow function, leading to low blood cell counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia). Regular blood tests are essential to monitor this.
* **Hepatotoxicity:** Severe liver damage, including VOD, is a serious potential side effect.  Liver function tests should be monitored closely.
* **Cardiac toxicity:**  Heart problems can occur, particularly with prolonged or high cumulative doses.  Heart function may need monitoring.
* **Hemorrhage:** Increased risk of bleeding exists, especially in patients with pre-existing bleeding disorders.
* **Tumor lysis syndrome:** This potentially life-threatening complication can occur, especially in patients with high tumor burden.  Measures to prevent and manage this are crucial.
* **Pregnancy and lactation:** This medication is categorized as pregnancy category D (potential risk to fetus), and breastfeeding is not recommended during and after treatment. Effective contraception is vital.
* **Drug interactions:** Gemtuzumab ozogamicin can interact with other drugs.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Renal and hepatic impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with kidney or liver problems, though specific guidance from prescribing information should be followed.


### FAQs

* **How is Gemtuzumab ozogamicin administered?**  It is given intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional.
