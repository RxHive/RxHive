# Gentamicin (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Gentamicin (Systemic)

### Usage

Gentamicin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic, primarily used to treat serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible gram-negative bacteria.  These infections can affect various parts of the body, including:

* **Sepsis (bloodstream infection):**  Often used in combination with other antibiotics, particularly when there's a high risk of resistant bacteria.
* **Meningitis (brain and spinal cord infection):**  Used in combination therapy for specific bacterial causes.
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):**  Can be used for complicated UTIs (like pyelonephritis) or when other antibiotics are ineffective.
* **Respiratory tract infections:** Particularly useful against severe infections where gram-negative bacteria are suspected.
* **Peritonitis (abdominal infection):**  Used specifically in cases of peritonitis associated with peritoneal dialysis.
* **Bone and joint infections (osteomyelitis):** Treatment of severe cases.
* **Skin and soft tissue infections:** In serious cases where gram-negative bacteria are identified as the cause.
* **Other infections:** Gentamicin may also be used off-label to treat certain infections caused by bacteria like *Bartonella* spp. (cat scratch disease), *Brucella* spp. (brucellosis), and *Yersinia pestis* (plague).  Use in these cases should be guided by a healthcare professional.


The use of Gentamicin should always be based on bacterial culture and sensitivity testing to ensure it is effective against the infecting organism.


### Dosage

Gentamicin dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including:

* **Severity of infection:** More severe infections often require higher doses.
* **Patient's age and weight:** Dosages are adjusted for children and infants.
* **Renal function:**  Kidney function significantly impacts Gentamicin elimination; reduced doses are necessary for those with impaired kidney function.

**Adult Dosage:**  The typical dosage range is 3â€“5 mg/kg/day given in divided doses every 8 hours (e.g., intravenously [IV] or intramuscularly [IM]).  However,  "once-daily" dosing regimens (higher single dose given less frequently) are also used, and specific dosage and frequency greatly varies depending on the infection being treated (see details in {genericMedicine}{details}).  Peak and trough blood levels of the drug are often monitored to optimize dosing and avoid toxicity.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Dosages for children and infants are considerably lower than for adults and are calculated based on weight and sometimes age, with careful monitoring crucial for safety.  Detailed pediatric dosing is provided within {genericMedicine}{details}.


**Administration:**  Gentamicin is typically administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM).  In certain situations, like peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis, it may be given intraperitoneally. For intraventricular administration (e.g., in treating ventriculitis), preservative-free formulations are essential.  IV administration typically involves a slow infusion over 30-120 minutes to minimize adverse effects.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Injection site pain (with IM administration)

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage):**  This is a significant concern, particularly with prolonged use or in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.  Symptoms might include decreased urine output, changes in blood tests (BUN, creatinine), and in severe cases, kidney failure.
* **Ototoxicity (hearing damage):**  This can range from tinnitus (ringing in the ears) to irreversible hearing loss.
* **Neurotoxicity:** This can manifest as numbness, tingling, muscle weakness, or even seizures.


**Other potential side effects:**  Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis), changes in blood counts, and imbalance of electrolytes (like potassium, calcium, or magnesium) are also possible.


If any concerning side effects occur, especially those listed above, immediately seek medical attention.

### How it Works

Gentamicin is a bactericidal antibiotic meaning it kills bacteria.  It achieves this by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacterial ribosomes. This prevents the bacteria from correctly synthesizing proteins, which is essential for their survival and reproduction, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.

### Precautions

* **Allergy:**  Gentamicin is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Cross-reactivity with other aminoglycosides is possible.
* **Renal impairment:** Dosage adjustments are crucial for patients with kidney problems to prevent nephrotoxicity.  Close monitoring of kidney function is essential.
* **Hearing impairment:** Gentamicin can cause hearing loss, particularly in patients with pre-existing hearing problems or those receiving high doses or prolonged therapy.  Regular hearing tests might be necessary.
* **Neuromuscular disorders:**  Caution is advised for patients with myasthenia gravis or other neuromuscular conditions because Gentamicin can exacerbate muscle weakness.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Gentamicin should be used with extreme caution during pregnancy due to potential fetal harm (Category D). It's also excreted in breast milk, requiring careful consideration if breastfeeding is necessary.
* **Drug interactions:** Gentamicin can interact with several other medications, including other nephrotoxic or ototoxic drugs.  This necessitates careful evaluation of all medications a patient is taking.
* **Superinfections:**  Like other antibiotics, Gentamicin can disrupt the normal bacterial balance in the body, potentially leading to opportunistic infections (e.g., by fungi or resistant bacteria).


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take Gentamicin?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the type and severity of the infection and your response to therapy.  Your healthcare provider will determine the appropriate treatment length.

* **Q: Can I take Gentamicin with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions can occur.

* **Q: How should I store Gentamicin?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the label.  Generally, it's best to keep it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking Gentamicin?** A: There are typically no specific dietary restrictions, but maintaining adequate hydration is essential, particularly to help support kidney function.

* **Q:  Can I drive or operate machinery while on Gentamicin?** A: Dizziness or drowsiness can be side effects.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if you experience these.
