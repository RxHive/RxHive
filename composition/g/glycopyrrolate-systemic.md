# Glycopyrrolate (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Glycopyrrolate (Systemic)

### Usage
Glycopyrrolate is a medication primarily used to reduce excessive salivation (sialorrhea), particularly in children aged 3-16 years with neurological conditions causing severe drooling.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates salivary gland secretions.  Beyond its primary use, glycopyrrolate also has important applications in:

* **Reversal of bradycardia and vagal reflexes:**  During surgery or other medical procedures, it can counteract dangerously slow heart rates (bradycardia) and excessive vagal nerve activity.
* **Reversal of muscarinic effects of cholinergic agents:**  It can be used to counteract the side effects of certain medications (like neostigmine or pyridostigmine) that affect the muscarinic receptors in the body.  These medications are sometimes used to reverse muscle relaxants.
* **Reduction of secretions at end of life (off-label):** In some cases, it's used to reduce the "death rattle," the noisy breathing sometimes experienced in the final stages of life, though this is considered off-label use.


### Dosage

Dosage of glycopyrrolate varies significantly depending on the specific use, patient age, and weight.  Always follow the prescription instructions provided by your doctor or healthcare professional.  The information below is for general understanding and should not be substituted for professional medical advice.


**Adults:**

* **Reversal of muscarinic effects of cholinergic agents (IV):** 0.2 mg for each 1 mg of neostigmine or 5 mg of pyridostigmine administered.
* **Reduction of secretions (preoperative, IM):** 4 mcg/kg administered 30-60 minutes before anesthesia.
* **Reversal of bradycardia/vagal reflexes (intraoperative, IV):** 0.1 mg as a single dose; repeat as needed at 2-3 minute intervals.
* **Reduction of secretions at end of life (off-label, IV/SubQ):** 0.2 mg every 4-8 hours as needed, not exceeding 4 doses/day.


**Children:**

* **Chronic drooling (oral):**  20 mcg/kg/dose three times daily (TID). The dose is titrated upwards in increments of 20 mcg/kg/dose every 5-7 days as tolerated, up to a maximum dose of 100 mcg/kg/dose TID, or a maximum of 1500-3000 mcg/dose.
* **Reduction of secretions (preoperative, IM):**  Infants and children ≤2 years: 4-9 mcg/kg; Children >2 years: 4 mcg/kg, administered 30-60 minutes before the procedure.
* **Reversal of bradycardia/vagal reflexes (intraoperative, IV):** 4 mcg/kg, up to a maximum of 100 mcg/dose; repeat at 2-3 minute intervals.
* **Reversal of muscarinic effects of cholinergic agents (IV):** 0.2 mg for each 1 mg of neostigmine or 5 mg of pyridostigmine administered.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are routinely recommended for hepatic or renal impairment, however, caution is advised, especially in cases of severe renal failure.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dry mouth, throat, skin, and nose
* Constipation
* Blurred vision
* Increased sensitivity to light
* Difficulty urinating
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Vomiting

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Rapid or irregular heartbeat (tachycardia, arrhythmias)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Confusion
* Hallucinations
* Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
* Severe constipation or bowel obstruction

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Glycopyrrolate is an anticholinergic medication. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter involved in many bodily functions, including stimulating gland secretions (like saliva). By blocking these receptors, glycopyrrolate reduces the stimulation of salivary glands, thus decreasing saliva production. Similarly, its effect on other muscarinic receptors explains its use in counteracting bradycardia and other effects of cholinergic agents.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Glycopyrrolate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, severe ulcerative colitis, paralytic ileus, glaucoma, urinary retention, or certain other conditions.  Consult your physician to determine if you have any contraindications.
* **Drug Interactions:** Glycopyrrolate can interact with several other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Glycopyrrolate is classified as Pregnancy Category B.  The effects of glycopyrrolate on lactation are not well established. Discuss the potential risks and benefits with your healthcare provider before using glycopyrrolate during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Geriatric and Pediatric Use:** Use caution in older adults and children due to increased susceptibility to side effects.
* **Patients with existing conditions:** Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, autonomic neuropathy, Down's Syndrome, or myxedema.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store glycopyrrolate?** A: Store glycopyrrolate as directed on the prescription label, usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: Can I take glycopyrrolate with other medications?** A: Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking before starting glycopyrrolate.  Some medications may interact with it.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Follow your doctor’s instructions for missed doses.  Do not double the next dose.
* **Q: How long does it take for glycopyrrolate to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration and the specific use.  Your doctor can provide more specific information.
* **Q: Is glycopyrrolate habit-forming?** A: Glycopyrrolate is not considered a habit-forming medication.
* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking glycopyrrolate?** A: Because of potential side effects like dizziness or blurred vision, caution is advised.  Avoid these activities until you know how the medication affects you.
