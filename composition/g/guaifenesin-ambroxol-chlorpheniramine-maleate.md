# Guaifenesin + Ambroxol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Guaifenesin + Ambroxol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  Specifically, it addresses:

* **Cough:** Guaifenesin is an expectorant; it thins and loosens mucus, making it easier to cough up. Ambroxol also helps to loosen mucus.
* **Congestion:** Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that helps to dry up runny noses and reduce nasal congestion.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage, but common ones include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a particularly common side effect of chlorpheniramine maleate.
* **Dry mouth:**  A common side effect of antihistamines.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be caused by both the antihistamine and potentially the expectorants in higher doses.
* **Headache:** Relatively common.
* **Nausea:** Less common, but possible.
* **Constipation:**  Possible side effect.
* **Insomnia:**  Especially if taken later in the day.
* **Blurred vision:** Less common.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions such as skin rash, itching, or swelling are possible.


**How it Works:**

* **Guaifenesin:**  Works by increasing the fluid content of respiratory tract mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel. It does *not* suppress the cough reflex.
* **Ambroxol:**  Increases the production of surfactant in the lungs, which helps to thin the mucus and facilitate its removal.  It's also thought to have some mild anti-inflammatory effects.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body in response to allergens and during infection. This reduces symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
