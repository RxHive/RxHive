# Gadofosveset
### Generic Name
Gadofosveset

### Usage
Gadofosveset is a gadolinium-based contrast agent used in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Its primary use is to help visualize blood vessels during MRA scans, specifically to assess aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) in adults with known or suspected peripheral vascular disease.  AIOD is a condition where the arteries supplying blood to the legs and pelvis become narrowed or blocked.  The contrast agent improves the visibility of these arteries on the MRI, allowing doctors to better evaluate the extent of blockage and plan treatment.  While its primary use is in MRA for peripheral vascular disease, it is a gadolinium-based contrast agent and may have other applications within MRI procedures, though these uses would not be considered primary.  Always follow your doctor's orders regarding its use.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (MRA):** Gadofosveset is administered intravenously (IV) as a bolus injection. The dose is 0.12 mL/kg body weight (0.03 mmol/kg), delivered over a maximum of 30 seconds.  This is followed by a 25-30 mL saline flush. The infusion rate should not exceed 1.5 mL/s.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of gadofosveset in children under 18 years old have not been established. It should not be used in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is recommended by the manufacturer for patients with impaired liver function.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 60 mL/kg/m² or higher, no dosage adjustment is needed. However, for patients with a GFR below 60 mL/kg/m², the dose should be reduced to 0.01-0.02 mmol/kg, and it must be used with extreme caution due to the increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).  If the patient is on hemodialysis, prompt hemodialysis following administration (within 3 hours) should be considered. Peritoneal dialysis is less effective at clearing gadolinium.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Burning sensation
* Dizziness
* Sensation of cold
* Vasodilation (widening of blood vessels)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Nausea
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Bruising at the injection site

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Acute renal failure
* Anaphylactoid reaction
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)
* QT prolongation on electrocardiogram (ECG)

If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Gadofosveset is a paramagnetic contrast agent containing gadolinium.  It works by reversibly binding to albumin, a protein in the blood plasma. This albumin binding keeps it within the bloodstream longer.  When exposed to a magnetic field during an MRI scan, the gadolinium enhances the signal from blood vessels, making them appear brighter and easier to visualize on the images.  This improved visualization is crucial for diagnosing conditions like AIOD where the blood vessels are narrowed or blocked.  The prolonged intravascular presence, due to albumin binding, extends the imaging window, providing more time for detailed assessment.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Gadofosveset is contraindicated in patients with a history of allergic reactions to gadolinium-based contrast agents.

**Warnings:**

* **Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF):** Gadofosveset carries a significant risk of NSF in patients with impaired kidney function.  This risk is highest in those with severe chronic kidney disease (GFR <30 mL/minute per 1.73 m²) or acute kidney injury.  The use of gadofosveset should be avoided in these patients unless absolutely necessary and when non-contrast MRI is unavailable.  NSF is a serious and potentially fatal condition causing fibrosis of the skin, muscles, and internal organs.

* **Hypersensitivity Reactions:**  Gadofosveset can cause hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. Patients with a history of allergic reactions or asthma should be closely monitored.

* **Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with renal impairment.  Monitor renal function before and after administration.

* **Other Precautions:**  Use caution in patients with sickle cell anemia and those who have received iodine-containing agents within 24 hours before Gadofosveset administration.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Gadofosveset is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  The excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, use with caution during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Gadofosveset to work?** A: Gadofosveset's effects are immediate during the MRI scan; it enhances the visibility of blood vessels within minutes of injection.

* **Q: How is Gadofosveset stored?** A: Follow the manufacturer's instructions for storage.  Generally, it should be stored at room temperature and protected from light.  Use immediately after opening.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions before or after receiving Gadofosveset?** A: Typically, no specific dietary restrictions are necessary before or after receiving Gadofosveset. Consult your doctor for any specific instructions.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects after receiving Gadofosveset.
