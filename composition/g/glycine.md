# Glycine
### Generic Name
Glycine

### Usage
Glycine, specifically a 1.5% sterile solution, is primarily used as an irrigant during transurethral surgical procedures involving the prostate or bladder.  Its primary function is to provide clear visibility during endoscopic procedures by distending the bladder and washing away blood and tissue fragments.  This allows surgeons to perform the procedure more accurately and safely.  It's crucial to understand that Glycine is intended solely for urological irrigation during these procedures and should not be used for injection via parenteral routes.

### Dosage
**Urologic Irrigation:** For transurethral procedures (like transurethral resection of the prostate), a 1.5% sterile glycine solution is used as needed. The amount used depends on the length and type of procedure and is determined by the surgeon's judgment.  It's administered via transurethral instillation using specialized urological instruments.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Glycine in pediatric patients have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised when using Glycine in these patient populations.

### Side Effects
Glycine irrigation, while generally well-tolerated, can cause several side effects, the frequency of which isn't always well-defined in literature. These can include:

* Acidosis
* Electrolyte imbalances (loss)
* Significant diuresis (increased urine production)
* Urinary retention
* Edema (swelling) and dehydration
* Cardiovascular/pulmonary issues: pulmonary congestion, hypotension (low blood pressure), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), angina-like pain, and thrombophlebitis (blood clot in a vein)
* Visual disturbances
* Convulsions (seizures)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Vertigo (dizziness)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels)
* Hyperammonemia (high ammonia levels)
* Transient blindness
* Coma (immediate or delayed)
* Digitalis toxicity (in patients already taking digitalis medications)


If any of these adverse effects occur, especially the serious ones, immediately consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works
Glycine's effectiveness as a surgical irrigant stems from its properties. It's non-hemolytic (doesn't break down red blood cells), non-electrolytic (doesn't significantly conduct electricity), or very weakly ionized.  These characteristics allow for good visibility during endoscopic procedures while also effectively removing blood and tissue debris.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Glycine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to glycine or its components, and in patients with anuria (absence of urine production).

**Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of worsening pre-existing hyponatremia (low sodium) with Glycine use.

**Caution:** Use Glycine with caution in patients with severe cardiopulmonary (heart and lung) dysfunction, hepatic impairment (liver problems), and renal impairment (kidney problems).


### FAQs

**Q:  Is Glycine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**

A:  Glycine is categorized as pregnancy Category C, meaning the risks to the fetus haven't been fully established.  It's unknown whether Glycine is excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  A healthcare provider should be consulted.

**Q: How is Glycine stored?**

A:  Storage instructions should be found on the product label. Generally, sterile solutions should be stored appropriately to maintain sterility.

**Q: Can Glycine be used for purposes other than surgical irrigation?**

A: No. Glycine is strictly for use as a urological irrigant during specific surgical procedures as described and should not be used for any other purpose.


**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**

A: Stop using Glycine and contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects, particularly the more serious ones listed above.
