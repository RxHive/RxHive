# Green Soap
### Generic Name
Green Soap

### Usage

Green soap is a topical preparation primarily used for its cleansing and emollient properties.  Its main applications include:

* **Treating and preventing dry, itchy skin:**  It helps alleviate the symptoms of minor skin irritations and conditions like atopic dermatitis (eczema) and allergic contact dermatitis.  It's effective at removing greasy substances from the skin and hair.
* **Preoperative skin preparation:** Historically used to cleanse the skin before surgery, though modern antiseptic agents have largely replaced it in this role.
* **Cleansing of surgical personnel:** Similarly, its use for cleansing surgeons and their assistants has diminished due to the availability of more effective antiseptics.
* **Shampoo for sensitive scalps:** For individuals sensitive to commercial shampoos, green soap diluted with water can be used as a gentle cleansing agent for the hair.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific use and formulation (usually a tincture or liquid).  There isn't a standardized dosage for all conditions.

**For treating dry, itchy skin or minor skin irritations:** Apply the green soap tincture topically as needed to the affected area. Gently rub it in until fully absorbed. Do not bandage unless advised by a doctor.

**For use as a shampoo:** Dilute the green soap with water to create a solution suitable for washing hair.

**Pediatric Use:** Green soap has been historically used in diluted forms to bathe newborns; however, parental guidance is crucial, and the use of milder cleansers should be considered.  Specific pediatric dosing information is not universally standardized and often depends on physician recommendation.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Skin irritation is the most frequently reported side effect.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Ingestion can cause serious health consequences, including acute colitis, rectal irritation, and in severe cases, gangrene.  Eye or mucous membrane contact should be avoided.

**Note:** If any adverse reaction occurs, discontinue use and seek medical advice immediately.


### How it Works

Green soap's effectiveness stems from its combination of properties:

* **Emollient:** It softens and soothes dry, irritated skin.
* **Detergent:**  Its cleansing action helps remove dirt, oil, and other substances that can exacerbate skin conditions.
* **Mild antiseptic:** The tincture form exhibits mild antiseptic properties, resulting in superficial bacterial cell damage, although it is not considered a strong antimicrobial agent.
* **Alkalinity and Fat Emulsification:** These properties contribute to its effectiveness in removing sebaceous secretions from the skin.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Avoid concurrent use with disulfiram.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients with hypersensitivity to lavender oil may experience photosensitivity reactions with residual hyperpigmentation.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of green soap during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not established. Consult a healthcare provider before use.
* **Children:** While historical use in diluted form for bathing newborns exists, it's essential to consult a pediatrician before using it on children.  Generally, milder cleansers are preferred.
* **Flammable:** Green soap tincture is flammable; keep away from open flames.
* **Ingestion:**  Green soap tincture is toxic if ingested.  Seek immediate medical attention if swallowed.
