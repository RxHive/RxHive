# Guanadrel
### Generic Name
Guanadrel

### Usage
Guanadrel is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It works by reducing the amount of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that causes blood vessels to constrict, leading to lower blood pressure.  While its primary use is in managing hypertension, it's important to note that Guanadrel is not a first-line treatment and is generally considered only when other antihypertensive medications have proven ineffective or unsuitable.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Hypertension):** Guanadrel is administered orally. The initial dose is typically 5 mg twice daily (BID).  The dosage can be gradually increased, under close medical supervision, to a maximum of 400 mg per day, divided into 2-4 doses.  The precise titration of the dose is highly individualized and depends on the patient's response and blood pressure readings.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Guanadrel in children have not been established, therefore, it is not recommended for pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired kidney function.  For those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 60-30 mL/min, the starting dose is 5 mg daily.  If CrCl is less than 30 mL/min, the starting dose should be 5 mg every other day.  Dose increases should be made cautiously, allowing at least 7 or 14 days between increases for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, respectively.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with liver impairment.  However, close monitoring of blood pressure and potential side effects is crucial.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, headache, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and nasal congestion.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing), bradycardia (slow heart rate), and worsening of pre-existing heart conditions.

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Guanadrel is a postganglionic adrenergic neuron blocking agent. It works by entering sympathetic nerve endings via the norepinephrine transporter.  Once inside, it displaces norepinephrine from its storage sites, thus reducing the amount of norepinephrine released when the nerve is stimulated. This decrease in norepinephrine leads to less vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and consequently, lower blood pressure.  The reduction in neurotransmitter release is especially significant in response to the postural changes that commonly increase sympathetic tone (e.g., standing up from a lying-down position).

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Guanadrel is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to guanadrel or any of its components.
* Pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the adrenal gland).
* Congestive heart failure.
* Concurrent use of, or within one week of discontinuing, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

**Warnings and Precautions:** Use with caution in patients with:

* Asthma
* Cerebrovascular disease
* Coronary artery disease
* History of recent myocardial infarction
* Orthostatic hypotension
* Peptic ulcer disease
* Renal impairment
* Patients requiring anesthesia (discontinue 48-72 hours prior to surgery)


**Drug Interactions:** Guanadrel's effects can be intensified or antagonized by other medications.  Concurrent use with alpha- or beta-adrenergic blockers and reserpine may increase the risk of orthostatic hypotension and bradycardia.  MAOIs, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine may counteract Guanadrel's blood pressure-lowering effects.  Guanadrel can enhance the action of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and methoxamine.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Guanadrel is categorized as pregnancy category B.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, use during breastfeeding should be approached with caution and only after careful consideration of the benefits and risks.

### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for Guanadrel to work?**
A: The onset of action varies but usually takes several days to weeks for full therapeutic effect.

**Q: Can I stop taking Guanadrel suddenly?**
A: No, abruptly stopping Guanadrel can lead to rebound hypertension.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering the dose gradually.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

**Q: How should I store Guanadrel?**
A: Store Guanadrel at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
