# Gliclazide + Metformin + Rosiglitazone

It's crucial to understand that a generic combination drug containing Gliclazide, Metformin, and Rosiglitazone **does not exist** as a readily available, FDA-approved, single-pill formulation.  These three medications are used to treat type 2 diabetes, but are typically prescribed individually or in various two-drug combinations.  While a doctor *could* theoretically prescribe these three drugs separately to be taken together, there's no single generic pill containing all three.

Therefore, providing details in the requested format for a non-existent drug would be misleading.  It's important to consult a doctor for appropriate diabetes management.  They can assess individual needs and prescribe the most suitable medication regimen, which may include one or more of these drugs, but will likely not be a combined pill.

However, we can offer information about each drug individually:

**Gliclazide:**

* **Generic Name:** Gliclazide
* **Usage:**  Treats type 2 diabetes by stimulating the pancreas to release more insulin.
* **Side Effects:** Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight gain, allergic reactions.
* **How it Works:**  It's a sulfonylurea that increases insulin secretion from the beta cells of the pancreas.

**Metformin:**

* **Generic Name:** Metformin
* **Usage:** Treats type 2 diabetes by decreasing glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, metallic taste, lactic acidosis (rare but serious).
* **How it Works:** It's a biguanide that works primarily by reducing hepatic glucose production and improving insulin sensitivity.

**Rosiglitazone:**

* **Generic Name:** Rosiglitazone
* **Usage:** Treats type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity.  Its use is now significantly restricted due to safety concerns.
* **Side Effects:**  Fluid retention, weight gain, heart failure, bone fractures, increased risk of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke).
* **How it Works:** It's a thiazolidinedione (TZD) that improves insulin sensitivity in muscle, fat, and liver cells.
