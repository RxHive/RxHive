# Guanabenz
### Generic Name
Guanabenz

### Usage
Guanabenz is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It's a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, meaning it works within the central nervous system to lower blood pressure. While its main application is in managing hypertension, it's not considered a first-line treatment and is generally used when other medications haven't been effective or are unsuitable for a patient.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For hypertension, the usual starting dose is 4 mg taken every 12 hours (twice daily).  The doctor may gradually increase the dose by 4-8 mg per day, at intervals of 1-2 weeks, until the blood pressure is controlled. The maximum recommended dose is 32 mg every 12 hours.  Guanabenz is available in tablet form.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of guanabenz in children have not been established, and therefore it's not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Patients with severe liver (hepatic) impairment may require a reduced dose.  While specific dosage adjustments aren't provided in the manufacturer's labeling for those with kidney (renal) impairment, caution is advised.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Sedation
* Somnolence (sleepiness)
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients or less frequently):**

* Weakness
* Chest pain
* Edema (swelling)
* Palpitations
* Anxiety
* Ataxia (loss of coordination)
* Depression
* Pruritus (itching)
* Rash
* Gynecomastia (breast enlargement in men)
* Abdominal pain
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Blurred vision
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Nasal congestion

**Serious but Rare Side Effect:** Rebound hypertension (a sudden and dangerous increase in blood pressure) can occur if the medication is stopped abruptly.

**Important Note:** If you experience any concerning side effects, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Guanabenz works by stimulating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the brain. This action reduces the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for regulating blood pressure. By decreasing the signals from the sympathetic nervous system, guanabenz leads to lower heart rate and decreased peripheral vascular resistance (the resistance to blood flow in the blood vessels). This combined effect results in a reduction in blood pressure.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Guanabenz should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to guanabenz or any of its ingredients.
* **Drug Interactions:** Although not extensively documented, increased sedation may occur when guanabenz is used with other central nervous system depressants.
* **Warnings:**  Abrupt discontinuation of guanabenz can lead to rebound hypertension.  Use caution in patients with cerebrovascular disease, recent myocardial infarction, severe coronary insufficiency, hepatic disease, renal impairment, or those requiring sedation.  Guanabenz is generally not recommended for older adults due to a higher risk of central nervous system side effects.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Guanabenz is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  The medication's excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, its use during breastfeeding should be avoided.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I stop taking Guanabenz suddenly?**
A: No. Abruptly stopping Guanabenz can cause rebound hypertension.  Always consult your doctor before stopping this medication; they will advise on a safe tapering schedule.

**Q: How should I store Guanabenz?**
A: Store Guanabenz tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.

**Q: Is Guanabenz addictive?**
A:  Guanabenz is not considered an addictive medication.

**Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking Guanabenz?**
A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking Guanabenz, as it can increase the risk of sedation and other side effects.  Discuss this with your doctor.

**Q: Is Guanabenz suitable for everyone with hypertension?**
A: No, Guanabenz is not a first-line treatment for hypertension and isn't suitable for all patients. Your doctor will determine if it's the appropriate medication for your specific condition and health circumstances.
