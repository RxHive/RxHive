# Gadoxetate Disodium
### Generic Name
Gadoxetate Disodium

### Usage
Gadoxetate disodium is a gadolinium-based contrast agent used in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize and characterize lesions in the liver.  Its primary use is in the detection and assessment of focal liver diseases. This includes helping differentiate between various liver conditions, such as different types of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, metastases), and other focal liver lesions.  While not its primary use, it can also aid in evaluating the extent and nature of liver disease.

### Dosage

**Liver imaging (Adults):** The recommended intravenous (IV) dose is 0.025 mmol/kg (0.1 mL/kg), administered as a rapid bolus injection at a rate of approximately 2 mL per second. The line should be flushed with normal saline afterward to ensure complete administration. Imaging can begin immediately after injection and can be performed up to 120 minutes post-injection.  However, in patients with elevated serum ferritin or bilirubin levels exceeding 3 mg/dL, MRI should be completed within 60 minutes post-administration.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of gadoxetate disodium in pediatric patients have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed. However, imaging performance might be reduced in patients with severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin levels > 3 mg/dL). If used in such cases, imaging should be completed within 60 minutes post-administration, and both non-contrast and contrast-enhanced images should be obtained for comparison and improved diagnostic accuracy.

* **Renal Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for renal impairment.  Use should be approached cautiously due to increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a serious and potentially fatal condition.  In patients with end-stage renal disease, imaging performance decreases, and completion of the MRI within 60 minutes, with both non-contrast and contrast-enhanced imaging is recommended. Prompt hemodialysis should be considered after administration in patients already undergoing hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis is likely less effective at clearing gadolinium.


### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Nausea

**Less Common (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**  A wide range of side effects have been reported, including abdominal pain, allergic reactions (anaphylaxis),  various skin reactions (rash, itching, swelling), cardiovascular issues (palpitations, changes in blood pressure), respiratory issues (dyspnea), and neurological symptoms (dizziness, headache, paresthesia).  Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a serious, though rare, side effect, primarily affecting patients with impaired kidney function.

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Gadoxetate disodium is a paramagnetic contrast agent containing gadolinium.  When exposed to a strong magnetic field during an MRI scan, it alters the magnetic properties of surrounding tissues. This change enhances the contrast in MRI images, making certain structures and lesions within the liver more easily visible.  Specifically, gadoxetate disodium is taken up by healthy liver cells, allowing for differentiation between healthy tissue and areas of damage or disease.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Gadoxetate disodium is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to gadoxetate disodium or any component of the formulation.

* **Increased Risk:** Patients with impaired kidney function are at increased risk of developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).  Pregnant women may also have an increased risk of gadolinium retention.  The use of gadoxetate disodium should be carefully considered and minimized in these populations.

* **Interactions:** Anionic drugs primarily excreted into the bile (such as rifampicin) may reduce the hepatic contrast enhancement and biliary excretion of gadoxetate disodium.

* **Warnings:**  Gadoxetate disodium should be used with caution in patients with renal or severe hepatic impairment.  A boxed warning emphasizes the risk of NSF in patients with reduced kidney function.  Careful assessment of renal function is crucial before administration.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Gadoxetate disodium is a Category C drug in pregnancy. While it may cross the placenta, use should be limited and only considered when the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. It's excreted in breast milk, but breastfeeding can usually continue. Options for temporary interruption of breastfeeding may be discussed with a healthcare provider.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is gadoxetate disodium administered?** A: It's administered intravenously (IV) as a rapid bolus injection.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: MRI imaging can begin immediately after administration, with results typically available shortly after the scan is completed.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones.

* **Q: How is gadoxetate disodium stored?** A: Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the product labeling.

* **Q: Is gadoxetate disodium safe for everyone?** A: No, it's not safe for everyone, especially those with impaired kidney function or hypersensitivity to gadolinium-based contrast agents.  Your doctor will determine if it's appropriate for you.

* **Q: What is nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)?** A: NSF is a rare but serious condition that can cause debilitating fibrosis of the skin, muscles, and internal organs. It is primarily associated with gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with severe kidney problems.
