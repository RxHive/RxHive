# Griseofulvin

**Generic Name:** Griseofulvin

**Usage:** Griseofulvin is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails (tinea infections like ringworm, athlete's foot, and jock itch).  It's particularly effective against dermatophytes, a type of fungus that causes these infections.  The specific type of infection and its severity will determine the dosage and duration of treatment.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and complete the entire course of medication, even if symptoms improve, to prevent recurrence.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.
* **Headache:** This is a relatively frequent side effect.
* **Dizziness:** Less common, but can occur.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Skin reactions:** Rash, itching, or hives.
* **Photosensitivity:** Increased sensitivity to sunlight, leading to sunburn more easily.
* **Rare but serious side effects:**  Liver damage, blood disorders (leukopenia, neutropenia), and allergic reactions.  These require immediate medical attention.

**How it Works:** Griseofulvin works by interfering with the growth and reproduction of fungi.  It's absorbed into the keratin of the skin, hair, and nails, where it inhibits fungal cell wall synthesis.  This prevents the fungus from spreading and allows the body's natural defenses to clear the infection.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  Improvement may take several weeks, and the full course of treatment is usually several months, especially for nail infections, to ensure the fungus is completely eradicated.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking griseofulvin?** A: Alcohol can potentially increase the risk of side effects. It's best to avoid alcohol or limit consumption while taking griseofulvin.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific advice.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double up on doses.
* **Q: Can I take griseofulvin with other medications?** A:  Griseofulvin can interact with certain medications. It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking to avoid potential interactions.  Some anticoagulants (blood thinners) are particularly notable examples.
* **Q: Are there any precautions I should take?** A:  Those with liver disease or blood disorders should use caution and potentially avoid griseofulvin. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before taking this medication.  Avoid exposure to direct sunlight and use sunscreen if necessary.
* **Q: What if my symptoms don't improve after several weeks of treatment?** A:  Contact your doctor.  They may need to re-evaluate the diagnosis, adjust the dosage, or prescribe a different antifungal medication.
