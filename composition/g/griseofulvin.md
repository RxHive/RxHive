# Griseofulvin
### Generic Name
Griseofulvin

### Usage

Griseofulvin is an antifungal medication used to treat a variety of fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails (dermatophytes).  It's primarily used when topical antifungal treatments haven't been effective. Specific conditions treated include:

* **Tinea corporis:** Ringworm of the body.
* **Tinea pedis:** Athlete's foot.
* **Tinea cruris:** Jock itch.
* **Tinea barbae:** Ringworm of the beard.
* **Tinea capitis:** Ringworm of the scalp (especially in children).
* **Tinea unguium (onychomycosis):** Fungal infection of the nails.

Griseofulvin is effective against several types of fungi, including *Trichophyton*, *Microsporum*, and *Epidermophyton* species.  It's important to note that it's not effective against all types of fungal infections, such as tinea versicolor.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the type of griseofulvin used (microsize or ultramicrosize), the patient's age and weight, and the severity of the infection.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Microsize Griseofulvin:** Typically 500 mg daily, taken either as a single dose or in 2-4 divided doses. Higher doses (750-1000 mg/day) may be used initially for severe infections, gradually reducing to 500 mg/day as the infection improves.
* **Ultramicrosize Griseofulvin:** Typically 375 mg daily, taken either as a single dose or in divided doses. Higher doses (up to 750 mg/day) might be used for difficult-to-treat infections.

**Children (over 2 years):**  Dosage is calculated based on weight.  Always consult a pediatrician for the appropriate dosage.  Generally, it's lower than the adult dose and is usually given once daily.


**Administration:** Griseofulvin is usually taken orally, often with a fatty meal to improve absorption.  Tablets can be swallowed whole or crushed and mixed with applesauce.


**Treatment Duration:** The duration of treatment varies greatly depending on the type and location of the infection and can range from several weeks to several months, especially for nail infections.  Complete eradication of the fungus is crucial; therefore, it's critical to adhere to the prescribed treatment duration.

### How it Works

Griseofulvin works by interfering with the growth and reproduction of fungi.  It is incorporated into the keratin of skin, hair, and nails, making these structures resistant to fungal invasion. This action helps the body gradually clear the existing fungal infection, preventing further fungal growth.  It's important to understand that it's not a fast-acting medication; it requires time to work effectively.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Griseofulvin is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to griseofulvin, liver failure, porphyria, and during pregnancy.
* **Drug Interactions:** Griseofulvin can interact with several other medications, including oral contraceptives, anticoagulants, and some anticonvulsants.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Griseofulvin is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it poses significant risks to a developing fetus. It should not be used during pregnancy. It's unclear whether griseofulvin is excreted in breast milk; therefore, breastfeeding is generally not recommended while using this medication.
* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with kidney or liver problems should use caution and be closely monitored by their doctor.  Individuals with lupus erythematosus should also use griseofulvin with caution due to the risk of lupus-like syndrome.  Photosensitivity is another possible side effect, so limiting sun exposure is recommended.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the type and location of the infection.  Nail infections, in particular, may take several months to fully clear.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking griseofulvin?** A: While there's no direct contraindication, excessive alcohol consumption can worsen liver function, and since liver damage is a potential side effect, moderation is recommended.

* **Q: How should I store griseofulvin?** A: Store griseofulvin as directed on the label, usually in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Is griseofulvin safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use should only be done under strict medical supervision, as it may increase the risk of side effects. Regular monitoring of liver and kidney function is necessary.
