# Gamma Benzene Hexachloride
### Generic Name
Gamma Benzene Hexachloride (Lindane)


**Please Note:** Lindane is no longer widely used due to significant safety concerns and potential neurotoxic effects.  This information is provided for educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its use.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using any medication, especially one with a history of safety concerns like Lindane.


### Usage
Lindane, the gamma isomer of benzene hexachloride, was primarily used as a topical insecticide to treat parasitic infestations. Its main application was in the treatment of head lice (pediculosis capitis), scabies (caused by the mite *Sarcoptes scabiei*), and crab lice (pubic lice, pediculosis pubis).  It was also occasionally used to treat other ectoparasite infestations.  However, due to its toxicity, safer alternatives are now preferred.


### Dosage
**Due to the significant health risks associated with Lindane, specific dosage information is not provided here.**  The use of Lindane is strongly discouraged due to its potential for neurotoxicity and other adverse effects.  There are significantly safer and more effective treatments available for lice and scabies.


### Side Effects
Lindane's use was associated with a range of side effects, some quite serious.  These include:

* **Nervous system effects:** Tremors, seizures (especially in children and individuals with pre-existing neurological conditions), dizziness, headache, weakness, confusion.
* **Skin irritation:**  Burning, itching, redness at the application site.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, hives, itching.
* **Hair loss:** In some cases, temporary or permanent hair loss has been reported.
* **Blood abnormalities:**  In rare instances, blood disorders have been observed.
* **Organ toxicity:** Potential for liver and kidney damage with prolonged or excessive use.


**Because of the serious side effects, even less common ones, it is crucial to seek immediate medical attention if any adverse reaction occurs after using Lindane.**


### How it Works
Lindane works by disrupting the nervous system of the parasites (lice and mites). It binds to the chloride ion channels in nerve cells, causing an influx of chloride ions, which disrupts nerve impulse transmission. This leads to paralysis and ultimately the death of the parasites.  However, this same mechanism of action can also affect the human nervous system, leading to the various side effects noted above.


### Precautions
**Lindane is generally considered unsafe and should not be used.**  Its use is contraindicated in:

* **Pregnant women:**  The risk of harm to the developing fetus is substantial.
* **Breastfeeding women:** Lindane can be passed into breast milk.
* **Infants and young children:**  They are particularly vulnerable to its neurotoxic effects.
* **Individuals with seizures or a history of neurological disorders:**  Lindane can trigger or worsen seizures.
* **Individuals with impaired liver or kidney function:**  The risk of organ toxicity is increased.

**Lindane should never be used near open wounds or broken skin.**  It should not be ingested or inhaled.  Its use should only be considered in extremely rare and exceptional circumstances under the strict supervision of a physician and only if safer alternatives are unavailable.


### FAQs
* **Q: Are there safer alternatives to Lindane?**  A: Yes, significantly safer and equally effective treatments for lice and scabies exist.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for recommendations on appropriate alternatives.
* **Q: How should Lindane be stored?** A:  Because of its dangers, it is strongly advised to not store Lindane.  If it is necessary for any reason, it should be stored in a tightly sealed container, away from children and pets, in a cool, dry place.
* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally ingest Lindane?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  This is a medical emergency.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects from Lindane?** A: Stop using Lindane immediately and seek medical attention.
