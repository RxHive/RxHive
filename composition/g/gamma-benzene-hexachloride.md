# Gamma Benzene Hexachloride

**Generic Name:** Gamma Benzene Hexachloride (Î³-BHC), also known as Lindane

**Usage:**  Lindane was historically used as an insecticide and pediculide (lice treatment).  Its use is now severely restricted or banned in many countries due to its toxicity and environmental concerns.  It was used to treat scabies, head lice, and body lice, and also to control agricultural pests.

**Side Effects:**  Lindane's side effects can be significant and range from mild to severe, depending on the dosage and method of exposure.  They include:

* **Nervous system effects:**  Headache, dizziness, tremors, seizures (especially in individuals with epilepsy or predisposing factors), convulsions, coma.  These are particularly concerning in children.
* **Skin irritation:**  Rash, itching, burning, dryness.
* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
* **Other potential effects:**  Fatigue, weakness, liver damage (rare but serious), blood disorders.  Exposure during pregnancy can cause developmental problems in the fetus.

**How it Works:** Lindane works by disrupting the nervous system of insects and parasites. It binds to the GABA receptors in the central nervous system, interfering with the transmission of nerve impulses, leading to paralysis and death in insects.  In humans, similar effects can occur, explaining the neurological side effects.
