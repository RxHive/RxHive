# Guaifenesin + Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide
### Generic Name
Guaifenesin + Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide


### Usage

This combination medication is a multi-symptom cold and cough remedy. It's typically used to relieve the symptoms of the common cold, flu, or other upper respiratory tract infections.  The individual components work together to target various symptoms:

* **Guaifenesin:** This is an expectorant. It thins and loosens mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.  This helps clear congestion in the chest and sinuses.

* **Bromhexine:**  Another expectorant, bromhexine also helps to loosen mucus, but through a slightly different mechanism than guaifenesin. This enhances the effectiveness of mucus clearance.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine. It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction or infection.  In this combination, it helps to reduce runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This is a cough suppressant (antitussive). It works in the brain to reduce the cough reflex.  This is particularly helpful for a dry, unproductive cough.

The combination is designed to address a range of cold and flu symptoms simultaneously, offering relief from congestion, cough, and upper respiratory discomfort.  It is important to note that this medication treats *symptoms* and does not cure the underlying infection.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation (e.g., tablet, syrup, liquid), manufacturer, and age of the patient.  **Always follow the instructions provided on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.**  Never exceed the recommended dosage.  There isn't a standardized IV formulation of this particular combination medication; it's generally administered orally.
