# Guaifenesin + Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Generic Name:** Guaifenesin + Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of the common cold or other upper respiratory infections (like the flu).  It combines several active ingredients to address different symptoms:

* **Guaifenesin (expectorant):** Helps loosen chest congestion by thinning mucus and making it easier to cough up.
* **Bromhexine (expectorant):** Also helps loosen and thin mucus, making it easier to expel.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate (antihistamine):** Relieves runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes associated with allergies or colds.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide (cough suppressant):** Reduces the urge to cough.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect, particularly with the chlorpheniramine maleate.
* **Dry mouth:**  Another frequent side effect, especially with antihistamines.
* **Nausea:** Less common, but possible.
* **Constipation:**  Can occur, particularly with antihistamines.
* **Headache:** Possible side effect.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be caused by the dextromethorphan or chlorpheniramine.
* **Blurred vision:** Less common, but possible.
* **Difficulty urinating:** Possible side effect, especially in men with prostate problems.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Though rare, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, or swelling can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if this happens.


**How it Works:** Each ingredient works through a different mechanism:

* **Guaifenesin and Bromhexine:** These expectorants increase the fluid content of mucus in the respiratory tract, making it less viscous and easier to cough up.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This antihistamine blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions, thus reducing symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This cough suppressant acts on the brain to reduce the cough reflex.
