# Glutamine
### Generic Name
Glutamine

### Usage
Glutamine, a nonessential amino acid, is primarily used as a medical food to support the healing of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and provide nutritional supplementation.  It's particularly beneficial for individuals with GI disorders, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and other critical illnesses.  Glutamine plays a crucial role in gut health, acting as a primary energy source for intestinal cells.  Its use helps maintain the integrity of the gut lining, reducing the risk of infections and complications associated with these conditions.  In addition, glutamine is used to help reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease and, when combined with recombinant human growth hormone and other nutritional support, in the management of short bowel syndrome.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's characteristics (age, weight, etc.).  Always follow the prescription and instructions provided by your healthcare provider.  There's no single universal dosage.

**Adults:**

* **Nutritional Supplementation:** Oral powder:  The average dose is 10 grams three times a day (TID), but the range can be 5-30 grams daily. Oral capsules: 500 mg/day.
* **Short Bowel Syndrome:** Oral: 30 grams daily, divided into six doses of 5 grams each for up to 16 weeks. This is typically used in conjunction with growth hormone and comprehensive nutritional support.
* **Sickle Cell Disease (prevention of vaso-occlusive pain):** Oral powder: Dosage is weight-based.  Patients weighing less than 30 kg receive 5 grams twice a day (BID); those weighing 30-65 kg receive 10 grams BID; and those over 65 kg receive 15 grams BID.


**Children:**

* **Nutritional Supplementation:** Oral powder: Typically 0.25-0.5 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, divided into three doses.
* **Sickle Cell Disease (prevention of vaso-occlusive pain):** Oral: Dosage is weight-based, mirroring the adult regimen:  Patients weighing less than 30 kg receive 5 grams BID; those weighing 30-65 kg receive 10 grams BID; and those over 65 kg receive 15 grams BID.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult your doctor if you have any concerns.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Chest pain
* Flatulence (gas)
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Cough
* Limb pain
* Back pain

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  A wide range of other side effects, including infections, allergic reactions, and problems affecting various organ systems, have been reported.  These are less frequent but warrant immediate medical attention if experienced.  


**Important Note:** This list is not exhaustive. If you experience any adverse effects, even those not listed, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid, meaning the body can typically produce it, but under certain stressful conditions (like illness or injury), supplementation may be necessary. It plays numerous crucial roles in the body,  particularly in maintaining gut health.  In sickle cell disease, it's believed to enhance the body's ability to manage oxidative stress within red blood cells, potentially reducing pain crises.  The exact mechanism of action varies depending on the specific clinical application.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Glutamine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to glutamine or any of its components.
* **Interactions:** Glutamine may interact with certain medications, notably lactulose.  It can potentially diminish the effectiveness of lactulose in reducing ammonia levels. Careful monitoring is required if these are used concurrently.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in individuals with liver or kidney impairment, as dosage adjustments may be necessary, although specific guidelines aren't currently available from the manufacturer.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding:  Glutamine is present in breast milk, so caution should be exercised during breastfeeding.  Always consult with your healthcare provider before using glutamine if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have pre-existing medical conditions.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take glutamine without a doctor's prescription?** A:  While glutamine is available as a supplement, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using it, particularly if you have any underlying health conditions.  They can determine the appropriate dosage and monitor for any potential side effects.
* **Q: How should I store glutamine?** A: Follow the storage instructions on the product packaging. Generally, glutamine powder should be kept in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: Is glutamine safe for long-term use?** A:  The long-term safety of glutamine is largely dependent on individual factors and the specific clinical application.  Always follow your healthcare provider's recommendations and undergo regular monitoring.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q: Are there any dietary restrictions with glutamine?**  A: There are no specific dietary restrictions associated with glutamine supplementation, but a balanced diet remains important for overall health.
