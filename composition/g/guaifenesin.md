# Guaifenesin
### Generic Name
Guaifenesin

### Usage
Guaifenesin is primarily used as an expectorant to treat coughs associated with the common cold, bronchitis, and other respiratory illnesses.  It works by thinning and loosening mucus (phlegm) in the airways, making it easier to cough up. This helps to clear congestion and relieve cough symptoms. While not a cure for the underlying illness, it alleviates a key symptom.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Oral):**  Dosage varies depending on the formulation. Always follow the instructions on the product label.

* **Granules:** 200-400 mg every 4 hours as needed, not exceeding 2400 mg in 24 hours.
* **Extended-release tablets:** 600-1200 mg every 12 hours as needed, not exceeding 2400 mg in 24 hours.
* **Immediate-release tablets:** 200-400 mg every 4 hours as needed, not exceeding 2400 mg in 24 hours.
* **Liquid:** 200-400 mg every 4 hours as needed, not exceeding 2400 mg in 24 hours.

**Pediatric Dosage (Oral):** Dosage is determined by the child's age and weight and the specific formulation.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for appropriate pediatric dosages.  The following is for informational purposes only and shouldn't replace professional medical advice:

* **Children 2-4 years:**  Dosage will vary significantly depending on the formulation and strength; consult a pediatrician or the medication label.
* **Children 4-6 years:** Dosage will vary significantly depending on the formulation and strength; consult a pediatrician or the medication label.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional if you have liver or kidney problems.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Stomach pain
* Vomiting
* Skin rash

Less common, but potentially more serious, side effects include nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) with consumption of very high doses.  

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult a doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works

Guaifenesin is believed to work by increasing the hydration of the respiratory tract and reducing the stickiness of mucus. This makes the mucus easier to expel through coughing, thus helping to clear congestion.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it appears to involve interactions with the mucus itself, rather than directly affecting the airways.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Extended-release tablets are not suitable for children under 12 years old as self-medication.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Guaifenesin is categorized as pregnancy category C.  Consult a doctor before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Avoid formulations containing alcohol if breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While not extensively documented, guaifenesin may interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.
* **Other Precautions:** Always follow the recommended dosage.  Drink plenty of fluids to help thin the mucus further.  Do not crush or break extended-release tablets. For children, carefully measure the liquid dosage using an appropriate measuring device.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take guaifenesin with other cough medicines?** A:  It's best to check with your doctor or pharmacist before combining guaifenesin with other cough or cold medications, especially those containing other expectorants or suppressants, to avoid potential interactions or overdosing.
* **Q: How long should I take guaifenesin?** A: Typically, guaifenesin is taken only as needed for the duration of your cough symptoms.  Do not exceed the maximum daily dosage.  If symptoms persist for more than a week or worsen, consult a doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: How should I store guaifenesin?** A: Store guaifenesin as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep it out of reach of children.
