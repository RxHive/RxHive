# Guaifenesin

**Generic Name:** Guaifenesin

**Usage:** Guaifenesin is an expectorant used to thin and loosen mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up.  It's commonly used to treat coughs associated with the common cold, the flu, bronchitis, and other respiratory illnesses.  It is *not* a cough suppressant; it does not reduce the frequency of coughing.

**Side Effects:**  Guaifenesin is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur.  These are usually mild and include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Upset stomach
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Rash (rare)

Serious side effects are rare.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:

* Allergic reaction (hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Severe stomach pain


**How it Works:** Guaifenesin works by increasing the fluid content of mucus in the respiratory tract. This makes the mucus less thick and sticky, allowing it to be more easily expelled from the lungs through coughing.  It does this by stimulating the secretion of mucus.  It does *not* directly suppress the cough reflex.
