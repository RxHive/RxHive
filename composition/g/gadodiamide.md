# Gadodiamide
### Generic Name
Gadodiamide

### Usage
Gadodiamide is a gadolinium-based contrast agent used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Its primary use is to improve the visualization of lesions and structures within the body that have abnormal blood vessel patterns. This includes areas in the brain, spine, and surrounding tissues, as well as organs and tissues within the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and retroperitoneal space (the area behind the abdominal cavity).  It essentially helps doctors see details more clearly during an MRI.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  The dosage varies depending on the area being imaged.  For body imaging (excluding the central nervous system), the intravenous (IV) dose is 0.05 mmol/kg for kidney imaging and 0.1 mmol/kg for imaging the intrathoracic (non-cardiac), intra-abdominal, pelvic, and retroperitoneal regions.  For central nervous system (CNS) imaging, the IV dose is 0.1 mmol/kg administered as a rapid injection.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Safety and efficacy have not been established for children under 2 years old. For children aged 2-16 years, the dosage is generally the same as for adults, but always follow the physician's specific instructions.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustment is specified for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.  For patients with renal (kidney) impairment, things are different:  If the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher,  use is permitted but with caution. If the GFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², gadodiamide is contraindicated. For patients on hemodialysis, prompt hemodialysis following administration (within 3 hours) should be considered. Peritoneal dialysis is less effective at removing gadodiamide from the body.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, Post-marketing and/or Case Reports):**

* Abdominal pain
* Acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis
* Acute renal failure
* Anaphylactic shock
* Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) – a serious and potentially fatal condition affecting the skin and other organs.  This is particularly important for patients with kidney problems.
* Other less frequent side effects include various allergic reactions, cardiac issues, and neurological symptoms.

If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Gadodiamide is a paramagnetic contrast agent. This means it contains unpaired electrons that create a local magnetic field. When water molecules (protons) move through this field during an MRI scan, their interaction with the gadodiamide causes them to realign with the main magnetic field faster.  This increased realignment results in an amplified signal, making the targeted areas appear brighter on the MRI images, thereby improving the visibility of structures and lesions.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Prior hypersensitivity to gadodiamide.
* Chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²).
* Acute kidney injury.
* Neonates up to 4 weeks old.

**Warnings:**

*  Gadodiamide carries a risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), especially in patients with impaired kidney function.  It's crucial to assess kidney function before administration.
*  Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions) can occur.
* Gadodiamide is for intravenous use only; it must never be injected intrathecally (into the spinal canal).
*  Patients with a history of allergic reactions or asthma should be carefully monitored.
*  Patients with anemia should be monitored closely.
*  Use with caution in patients with renal impairment.



### FAQs

* **Q: How is Gadodiamide administered?** A: It's administered intravenously (IV) as a rapid injection, usually followed by a saline flush.

* **Q: How long does it take to be eliminated from the body?** A:  Elimination depends on kidney function.  The time frame for clearance is not clearly defined in the information, but renal clearance is crucial.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any side effects to your doctor immediately.  Some side effects are serious and require prompt medical attention.

* **Q: Is Gadodiamide safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: Gadodiamide is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  The risk to the fetus is unknown.  The use during breastfeeding should carefully consider the benefits versus the potential risk to the nursing infant.  Discuss this with your doctor.

* **Q: How is Gadodiamide stored?** A:  Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions as provided by the manufacturer.
