# Glycopyrrolate (Oral Inhalation)
### Generic Name
Glycopyrrolate (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage
Glycopyrrolate oral inhalation is a long-acting anticholinergic medication primarily used for the maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  This includes conditions like chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It's designed to help improve breathing and reduce symptoms, not to treat acute attacks.

### Dosage

**Adults (COPD):**

* **Dry powder inhaler (capsule):**  The typical dose is one 15.6 mcg capsule inhaled twice daily (BID).  The maximum recommended dose is also 15.6 mcg BID.  It's crucial to use the provided inhaler device and follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.  Do not swallow the capsules.
* **Nebulization solution:** One 25 mcg vial inhaled twice daily (BID) is the usual dose, with a maximum of 25 mcg BID.  Again, use only with the designated nebulizer and follow the manufacturer's instructions precisely. Do not inject or swallow the solution.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of glycopyrrolate oral inhalation in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed.
* **Renal Impairment:** For patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m² or higher, no dosage adjustment is necessary. However, for those with an eGFR below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m² or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, the manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments.  Use should be cautious in these cases as systemic exposure to the drug might increase.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Frequency not precisely defined, but generally occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Fatigue

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (reported in less than 1% of patients, often post-marketing reports or case studies):**

* Angioedema (swelling of the skin, often around the eyes, lips, or tongue)
* Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat)
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Insomnia
* Skin rash

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Glycopyrrolate is an anticholinergic bronchodilator. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that causes the muscles in the airways to constrict. By competitively and reversibly inhibiting acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors (primarily subtypes 1 and 3) in the bronchial smooth muscle, glycopyrrolate promotes relaxation and widening of the airways, making it easier to breathe.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Glycopyrrolate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to glycopyrrolate or any component of the formulation.

* **Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening breathing), drowsiness, blurred vision, and immediate hypersensitivity reactions.

* **Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution when using glycopyrrolate in patients with unstable ischemic heart disease, narrow-angle glaucoma, severe renal impairment/ESRD, or urinary retention.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Glycopyrrolate should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus.  The drug's excretion in breast milk is unknown, so carefully weigh the risks and benefits of breastfeeding while using this medication.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I use glycopyrrolate for an acute asthma attack?**
A: No. Glycopyrrolate is for long-term maintenance treatment of COPD, not for acute symptom relief.  Use a short-acting bronchodilator for acute episodes.

**Q: How should I store glycopyrrolate?**
A: Follow the manufacturer's instructions for storage. Generally, it should be kept at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double up on doses.

**Q: Can I take other medications with glycopyrrolate?**
A:  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to avoid potential interactions.

**Q:  What are the long-term effects of using glycopyrrolate?**
A:  Long-term effects are generally well-tolerated for most patients, but regular monitoring by your physician is crucial to detect and manage any potential side effects.
