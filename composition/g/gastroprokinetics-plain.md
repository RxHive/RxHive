# Gastroprokinetics   Plain
### Generic Name
Gastroprokinetics (Plain)


**Note:**  "Gastroprokinetics (Plain)" is a generic term encompassing several medications that improve gastric motility.  There isn't one single drug with this name.  This information will provide a general overview applicable to the class of gastroprokinetic drugs. Specific instructions always come from your doctor or pharmacist, referring to the *brand name* and *specific active ingredient* prescribed.  Examples of specific gastroprokinetics include Metoclopramide and Domperidone.  This overview will not cover all drugs in this class, and individual drug profiles may vary.


### Usage
Gastroprokinetic medications are primarily used to treat conditions characterized by delayed gastric emptying or decreased motility of the gastrointestinal tract.  These conditions include:

* **Gastroparesis:** A condition where the stomach takes too long to empty its contents. This often leads to nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloating.
* **Diabetic gastroparesis:**  Gastroparesis specifically associated with diabetes.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Following surgery, chemotherapy, or other causes.
* **Reflux:**  In some cases, these drugs can be used to improve gastric emptying and potentially reduce reflux symptoms, though this is not their primary use.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific active ingredient (e.g., Metoclopramide, Domperidone), the patient's age, weight, medical condition, and the route of administration.  **It is crucial to follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions precisely.**  There is no universal dosage information for "Gastroprokinetics (Plain)."

* **Oral Administration (Tablets, Capsules, Suspensions):**  Dosages are usually determined based on the specific drug and individual patient needs.  The regimen often involves multiple doses per day, and the total daily dosage varies widely.
* **Intravenous (IV) Administration:** IV administration is often used in hospital settings, particularly after surgery or during severe cases of nausea and vomiting.  Dosage and frequency are determined by the physician based on the patient's response and clinical condition.
* **Pediatric Dosage:**  Pediatric dosages are carefully calculated based on the child's weight and age and are usually significantly lower than adult doses.
* **Geriatric Dosage:** Older adults may require lower doses due to potential age-related changes in metabolism and kidney function.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Diarrhea
* Constipation (less common)
* Restlessness
* Extrapyramidal symptoms (rare, but serious, involving involuntary muscle movements â€“ more common with Metoclopramide)

Less common but serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions
* Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
*  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) - a rare, but life-threatening condition (more common with Metoclopramide).


**If you experience any concerning side effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.**



### How it Works
Gastroprokinetics work by increasing the contractions of the muscles in the stomach and upper small intestine.  This enhanced motility promotes faster emptying of the stomach and improves the movement of food through the digestive tract. The exact mechanism varies slightly depending on the specific drug, involving interaction with neurotransmitters that regulate gut motility.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  These medications may be contraindicated in individuals with certain medical conditions, such as bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hypersensitivity to the active ingredient.
* **Drug Interactions:** Gastroprokinetics can interact with other medications. Inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of gastroprokinetics during pregnancy and breastfeeding varies depending on the specific drug. Always consult your doctor before using these medications if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects and may require dosage adjustments.
* **Patients with Parkinson's disease:** Use caution, as some gastroprokinetics can worsen symptoms.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take gastroprokinetics with other medications?** A:  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential drug interactions before combining gastroprokinetics with other medications.
