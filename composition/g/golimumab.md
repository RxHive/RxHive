# Golimumab

**Generic Name:** Golimumab

**Usage:**

Golimumab is a biologic drug used to treat several inflammatory conditions, primarily:

* **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA):**  To reduce signs and symptoms, and to slow structural damage to the joints.  It's often used in combination with methotrexate.
* **Psoriatic arthritis:** To reduce signs and symptoms, including joint inflammation and skin psoriasis.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis:** To reduce signs and symptoms, such as back pain and stiffness.
* **Psoriasis:** To clear skin lesions in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
* **Ulcerative colitis:** To treat moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis.
* **Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS):** To reduce the number and severity of HS lesions.


**Important Note:** Golimumab is a prescription medication and should only be used under the supervision of a doctor. The specific dosage and treatment plan will vary depending on the condition being treated and the individual patient's response.


**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, golimumab can cause side effects. Some common side effects include:

* **Injection site reactions:** Redness, swelling, pain, or itching at the injection site.
* **Infections:** Increased risk of infections, including serious infections.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Upper respiratory tract infections:**
* **Allergic reactions:** In rare cases, severe allergic reactions can occur.

More serious, but less common, side effects include:

* **Tuberculosis (TB) reactivation:** Golimumab can reactivate latent TB, so screening for TB is essential before starting treatment.
* **Malignancies (cancers):**  An increased risk of certain cancers has been observed in patients using TNF blockers like golimumab.
* **Heart failure:**
* **Nervous system disorders:**  Such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or other demyelinating diseases.
* **Blood disorders:**  Such as decreased blood cell counts.
* **Liver problems:**


**How it Works:**

Golimumab is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker.  TNF is a protein in the body that plays a significant role in inflammation.  By blocking TNF, golimumab helps to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms of the inflammatory conditions it's used to treat.
