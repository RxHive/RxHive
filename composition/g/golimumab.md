# Golimumab
### Generic Name
Golimumab

### Usage

Golimumab is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers.  It's primarily used to treat various inflammatory conditions by targeting and neutralizing a protein called TNF-alpha.  TNF-alpha is a crucial player in the inflammatory process, contributing to the symptoms and damage associated with several autoimmune diseases.

Golimumab's main uses include:

* **Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis:**  Often used in combination with methotrexate, it helps reduce joint inflammation, pain, and stiffness.
* **Active psoriatic arthritis:**  This medication targets the inflammation in joints and skin associated with this condition, improving symptoms and potentially slowing disease progression.
* **Moderate to severe ulcerative colitis:** It helps reduce inflammation in the colon, easing symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis:** Golimumab helps manage the inflammation and pain in the spine and surrounding areas characteristic of this condition.

While less common, Golimumab may also be used off-label for other inflammatory conditions based on a doctor's assessment.


### Dosage

Golimumab is administered either intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SubQ, injection under the skin).  Dosage and frequency vary significantly depending on the condition being treated and the route of administration.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's precise instructions.

**Adult Dosages (Examples â€“ always consult prescribing information):**

* **Rheumatoid arthritis:**  IV: 2 mg/kg at weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks; SubQ: 50 mg once a month.  Often used with methotrexate.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis & Psoriatic arthritis:** IV: 2 mg/kg at weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks; SubQ: 50 mg once a month. May be used alone or with other medications.
* **Ulcerative colitis:** SubQ: Induction phase (200 mg at week 0, 100 mg at week 2), followed by a maintenance phase (100 mg every 4 weeks).


**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of Golimumab in children under 18 have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, but close monitoring is essential.


### Side Effects

Golimumab, like other TNF blockers, can cause various side effects.  The frequency and severity vary among individuals.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)
* Upper respiratory infections (colds, sinus infections)
* Headaches
* Nausea

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, including tuberculosis)
* Increased risk of certain cancers (lymphoma)
* Heart failure worsening
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Blood disorders (low blood cell counts)
* Neurological problems (numbness, tingling)

**Important Note:**  If any concerning side effects occur,  seek immediate medical attention. This list isn't exhaustive; consult a healthcare professional for a complete understanding of potential risks.


### How it Works

Golimumab works by blocking the action of TNF-alpha, a protein that plays a significant role in inflammation.  By binding to TNF-alpha, Golimumab prevents it from interacting with its receptors on cells. This, in turn, reduces the inflammatory response, alleviating symptoms of autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.  Essentially, it helps dampen the body's overactive immune response.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Do not use Golimumab if you're allergic to it or any of its components.
* **Infections:**  Golimumab increases the risk of infections.  Tell your doctor about any current or recent infections.  Screening for latent tuberculosis is crucial before starting treatment.
* **Heart Failure:**  Use with caution in patients with heart failure.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using Golimumab during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Other Medications:** Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible.
* **Vaccinations:**  Live vaccines should be avoided while on Golimumab.


### FAQs

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.  Don't try to double up on the next dose.

* **Q:  Is Golimumab safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term safety is continually monitored, but the decision regarding long-term use should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider, weighing potential benefits against the risks.  Regular monitoring is vital during prolonged treatment.
