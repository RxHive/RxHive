# Glycerine
### Generic Name
Glycerin (Glycerol)

### Usage
Glycerin, also known as glycerol, is a versatile compound with a wide range of applications.  Its primary uses are as a humectant (attracting and retaining moisture), solvent, and sweetener in food and beverages. In the pharmaceutical and personal care industries, it's a common ingredient in numerous products due to its lubricating and smoothing properties.  These include cough syrups, elixirs, expectorants, toothpaste, mouthwashes, skin care products, shaving creams, hair care products, soaps, and personal lubricants.  Medically, it's used as a laxative when administered rectally in suppository or enema form, acting by drawing water into the bowel, thereby softening stool and stimulating bowel movements.  In ophthalmic procedures, it may be used to temporarily reduce vitreous volume and intraocular pressure.  In solid dosage forms, it acts as a tablet holding agent.


### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the intended use and route of administration.  

* **Oral (Adjunct in Acute Glaucoma):**  Initiallty, 1-1.8 g/kg as a 50% solution.  This is a specialized use requiring close medical supervision.

* **Rectal (Constipation):**
    * **Adults:** 2250 mg suppository as needed.
    * **Children:** 1375 mg suppository as needed.

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions carefully.


### Side Effects
Common side effects, especially with oral administration, may include headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, thirst, dizziness, and mental confusion.  Severe dehydration can also occur with high doses.

Intravenous (IV) administration can, in rare cases, lead to hemolysis (red blood cell breakdown), hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin in the urine), and acute renal failure. Rectal administration may cause local irritation such as rectal discomfort and burning.

Serious, but less common side effects, particularly with IV use, can include cardiac arrhythmias, circulatory overload, pulmonary edema, and congestive heart failure.


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly severe ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Glycerin acts as an osmotic dehydrating agent. Its hygroscopic (water-attracting) nature causes it to draw water from the surrounding tissues into the bloodstream.  When used as a laxative, this effect draws water into the intestines, softening stool and making it easier to pass. In the eye, this reduces vitreous volume and intraocular pressure.


### Precautions
Glycerin should be used with caution in individuals with decreased kidney or liver function, hypervolemia (increased blood volume), cardiac failure, renal disease, dehydration, or diabetes.  It's generally not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Interactions with other medications are possible; therefore, always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.  Those with a known hypersensitivity to glycerin should avoid its use.
