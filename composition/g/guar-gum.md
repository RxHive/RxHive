# Guar Gum
### Generic Name
Guar Gum

### Usage
Guar gum, a natural dietary fiber derived from guar beans, is primarily used to treat constipation.  Its ability to absorb water and form a gel in the intestines helps to increase stool bulk and soften the stool, making bowel movements easier.  Beyond constipation, guar gum has also shown promise in managing certain aspects of diabetes mellitus (by slowing down glucose absorption), lowering high cholesterol levels (by binding to cholesterol in the gut), and alleviating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in some individuals.  It's important to note that the evidence supporting these secondary uses is not as robust as the evidence for its use in treating constipation.  Always consult a doctor before using guar gum for any condition.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual. It's crucial to follow your doctor's prescribed dosage carefully.  

**Adults:**

* **Constipation:** Typically starts at 4 grams per day, gradually increasing to a maximum of 12 grams daily.  This gradual increase helps minimize gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Diabetes Mellitus:**  A common dosage is 15 grams per day.
* **High Cholesterol:** Usually 15 grams per day, often combined with 5 grams of pectin and 5 grams of insoluble fiber.
* **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):**  May involve 5 grams of *partially hydrolyzed* guar gum.


**Children:** Guar gum is generally not recommended for children.


**Administration:** Guar gum is usually taken orally, mixed thoroughly into a sufficient amount of liquid (at least 200 ml) such as water or juice to prevent choking.  Never take it dry. It is advisable to take guar gum with meals or immediately before meals.


### Side Effects
Common side effects, particularly at higher doses, can include:

* Flatulence (gas)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Decreased appetite
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) â€“ more likely in individuals with diabetes

Less common, but more serious side effects may occur.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Guar gum is a soluble fiber. When ingested and mixed with water, it swells and forms a viscous gel. This gel increases the bulk and softness of the stool, promoting easier bowel movements and relieving constipation.  In the case of diabetes, this gel slows down the absorption of glucose into the bloodstream, helping to regulate blood sugar levels.  Regarding cholesterol, the gel binds to cholesterol in the digestive tract, preventing its absorption and helping to lower blood cholesterol levels.


### Precautions
* **Allergies:** Guar gum should be avoided by individuals with known allergies to guar beans or legumes.
* **Drug Interactions:** Guar gum can interact with several medications, including ethinyl estradiol (estrogen), metformin (a diabetes medication), penicillin, and some antihypertensive medications.  These interactions can either reduce the effectiveness of the other medication or increase the risk of side effects.  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, before starting guar gum.
* **Esophageal or Intestinal Obstruction:**  Individuals with esophageal disorders, difficulty swallowing, or intestinal obstructions should avoid guar gum as it may worsen these conditions.
* **Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women:** The safety and efficacy of guar gum during pregnancy and breastfeeding have not been established.  It is best to consult your doctor before using it during these periods.
* **Underlying Medical Conditions:** Individuals with conditions affecting blood pressure or blood-related diseases should use caution and seek medical advice before taking guar gum.
