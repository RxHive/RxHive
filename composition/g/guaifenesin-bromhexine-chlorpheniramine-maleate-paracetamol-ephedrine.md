### Generic Name:  Guaifenesin + Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Paracetamol + Ephedrine

This combination medication is not typically found as a single, pre-made generic formulation in many countries.  Instead, these individual components are often combined in various proprietary brands and may vary in their proportions.  Therefore, the following information is a summary based on the individual properties of each ingredient, and the specific dosage, side effects, and precautions will depend on the exact formulation you have. Always consult the patient information leaflet provided with your specific medicine.


### Usage

This combination drug is typically used to provide relief from symptoms associated with the common cold and upper respiratory tract infections. Each component targets specific symptoms:

* **Guaifenesin:** Acts as an expectorant, helping to thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.
* **Bromhexine:**  Also an expectorant, assisting in mucus thinning. It works by reducing the stickiness of the mucus.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine, it helps to relieve sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes associated with allergies and the common cold.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** A pain reliever and fever reducer. It reduces discomfort and helps lower body temperature.
* **Ephedrine:** A decongestant, it helps to shrink swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness and improving breathing.


This combination aims to provide comprehensive relief from multiple cold symptoms.

### How it Works

The combination drug works by targeting different aspects of cold and flu symptoms:

* **Expectorants (Guaifenesin & Bromhexine):**  Increase mucus secretion and reduce its viscosity, facilitating its removal from the airways.
* **Antihistamine (Chlorpheniramine Maleate):** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released during allergic reactions, reducing symptoms like sneezing and runny nose.
* **Analgesic/Antipyretic (Paracetamol):**  Reduces fever by affecting the areas of the brain that regulate body temperature, and relieves pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Decongestant (Ephedrine):**  Stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages to reduce swelling and congestion.
