# Guanethidine
### Generic Name
Guanethidine

### Usage
Guanethidine is primarily used to treat moderate to severe hypertension (high blood pressure). It works by reducing the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, which helps to lower blood pressure.  It can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications.  Less common uses include managing certain types of glaucoma and lid retraction associated with hyperthyroidism, usually via ophthalmic solutions.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Oral, unless otherwise specified):**

* **Hypertension:** Treatment typically begins with a low dose (10 mg daily) and is gradually increased (by increments of 10 mg every 5-7 days) until the desired blood pressure is achieved.  The maintenance dose usually ranges from 25 to 50 mg once daily.
* **Hypertensive Crisis (Intramuscular):** 10-20 mg as a single dose.
* **Ophthalmic Use (Glaucoma, Lid Retraction):**  The dosage for ophthalmic solutions varies widely depending on the specific formulation and condition, ranging from 1% to 5% solutions, sometimes combined with adrenaline.  Always follow the instructions provided by your ophthalmologist.

**Pediatric Dosage (Oral):**

* **Hypertension:**  The starting dose is typically 200 mcg/kg/day, increased by increments of 200 mcg/kg every 7-10 days as needed, based on response and close monitoring.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by manufacturers; however, caution is advised.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments, including extending the dosing interval or dose reduction, are recommended for moderate impairment (creatinine clearance 41-65 mL/min).  Guanethidine is contraindicated in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10-40 mL/min).


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Weakness
* Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Edema (swelling)
* Sexual dysfunction

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Angina (chest pain)
* Myocardial ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart)
* Cerebral ischemia (reduced blood flow to the brain)
* Worsening of intermittent claudication (pain in the legs during walking)


**If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Guanethidine is a peripheral antiadrenergic drug. It works by reducing the release of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), a neurotransmitter responsible for increasing heart rate and blood vessel constriction. By decreasing norepinephrine, guanethidine lowers both heart rate and blood vessel resistance, thereby lowering blood pressure.  It primarily affects the sympathetic nervous system, impacting the body's "fight or flight" response.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Guanethidine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the adrenal gland), heart failure unrelated to hypertension, and severe renal impairment. It should not be used with MAO inhibitors (monoamine oxidase inhibitors).
* **Drug Interactions:** Guanethidine can interact with numerous other medications, including antidepressants (TCAs), MAOIs, and many others.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Guanethidine is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its safety hasn't been fully established.  It is generally avoided during the first trimester and close to labor. It is also excreted in breast milk and therefore not recommended during breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  Use caution in patients with asthma, coronary artery disease, cerebral artery disease, gastrointestinal ulcers, Parkinson's disease with autonomic neuropathy, and moderate renal impairment.  Patients should be advised to change positions slowly to avoid orthostatic hypotension.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Guanethidine suddenly?** A: No. Abrupt withdrawal can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually reducing the dose.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Guanethidine?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, as directed on the label.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Guanethidine?** A: It is generally advisable to avoid alcohol, as it can interact with Guanethidine and increase the risk of orthostatic hypotension.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience dizziness or lightheadedness?** A: Sit or lie down until the symptoms subside.  Report this to your doctor.
