# Guaifenesin + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylpropanolamine
### Generic Name: Guaifenesin + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylpropanolamine


This combination medication is typically not sold under a single generic name as it combines four separate active ingredients, each addressing different aspects of cold and flu symptoms.  It's often found under various brand names, formulations, and slightly altered combinations. Therefore, information below pertains to this specific four-drug combination, understanding that some brands might exclude one or more components.  Always refer to your specific product labeling for precise ingredient amounts and usage instructions.

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used for symptomatic relief of the common cold and flu.  Each ingredient targets specific symptoms:

* **Guaifenesin:** Acts as an expectorant, thinning and loosening mucus in the lungs to make it easier to cough up.  This helps relieve congestion in the chest and airways.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  A first-generation antihistamine that helps reduce runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes associated with allergies and the common cold.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:**  A cough suppressant (antitussive) that reduces the urge to cough. It is most effective for coughs that are dry and non-productive (not producing mucus).
* **Phenylpropanolamine:** A decongestant that helps relieve nasal congestion by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages.  *Note: Phenylpropanolamine is less commonly included in modern formulations due to concerns about potential cardiovascular side effects.  Many newer formulations have replaced this with pseudoephedrine or another decongestant.*

This combination medication is intended for temporary symptom relief and is not a cure for colds or the flu.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific brand and formulation.  **Always follow the instructions on your medication label.**  Dosage for adults and children will be clearly indicated, often varying by age and weight.  This information should *never* replace the directions printed on the medication packaging.  Oral administration is standard.  There is no IV formulation for this specific combination.

**Crucially, this information should not be used to determine dosage. Check the label carefully, and always consult a healthcare professional before starting any new medication.**


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Headache
* Nervousness
* Difficulty sleeping
* Increased heart rate (especially with phenylpropanolamine)

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible, and require immediate medical attention.  These can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Severe dizziness or fainting
* Irregular heartbeat
* High blood pressure


If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and seek medical advice immediately.

### How it Works

As detailed in the "Usage" section, each ingredient works independently to target specific cold and flu symptoms. Guaifenesin thins mucus, chlorpheniramine reduces allergy and cold symptoms, dextromethorphan suppresses coughs, and phenylpropanolamine reduces nasal congestion. The combination aims to provide comprehensive symptom relief.


### Precautions

* **Interactions:** This combination may interact with other medications, particularly other cold and flu remedies, antidepressants, sedatives, and certain heart medications. Consult your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medication if you are on other medications.
