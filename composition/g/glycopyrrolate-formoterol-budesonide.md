**Generic Name:** Glycopyrrolate + Formoterol + Budesonide (Triple Therapy Inhaler)

**Usage:**

This combination inhaler is used to prevent and treat symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It's also sometimes used for severe asthma, though not as the first-line treatment.  Each component addresses different aspects of COPD/Asthma:

* **Glycopyrrolate:** A long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator. It relaxes the muscles in the airways, making it easier to breathe.
* **Formoterol:** A long-acting beta2-agonist bronchodilator. It also relaxes the airways and improves breathing.
* **Budesonide:** An inhaled corticosteroid. It reduces inflammation in the airways, preventing the narrowing and swelling that contribute to COPD and asthma symptoms.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the specific components of the medication. Common side effects may include:

* **Glycopyrrolate:** Dry mouth, constipation, headache, cough, throat irritation.
* **Formoterol:** Tremors, headache, muscle cramps, increased heart rate.
* **Budesonide:** Hoarseness, thrush (oral yeast infection), cough, headache, sore throat.

Less common but more serious side effects can occur.  These include:  increased risk of pneumonia, paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing), osteoporosis (with long-term use of budesonide), glaucoma, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.

**How it Works:**

This triple therapy inhaler combines three different mechanisms to manage COPD/severe asthma:

* **Bronchodilation:** Glycopyrrolate and formoterol work by relaxing the muscles surrounding the airways, widening them and making it easier for air to flow in and out of the lungs.
* **Inflammation reduction:** Budesonide reduces inflammation in the airways, preventing the swelling and narrowing that restrict airflow.

By combining these actions, the triple therapy inhaler provides effective and long-lasting relief of COPD/severe asthma symptoms.
