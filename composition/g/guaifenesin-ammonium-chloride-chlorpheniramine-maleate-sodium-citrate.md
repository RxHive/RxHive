# Guaifenesin + Ammonium Chloride + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Sodium Citrate

**Generic Name:** Guaifenesin + Ammonium Chloride + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Sodium Citrate


**Usage:** This combination drug is an expectorant and decongestant used to relieve symptoms of the common cold and other upper respiratory infections.  Specifically:

* **Guaifenesin:**  Thins and loosens mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.  It's an expectorant.
* **Ammonium Chloride:** Helps to thin mucus (though its effectiveness is debated and its use is declining). It's also an expectorant.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  Reduces runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes by blocking histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. It's an antihistamine.
* **Sodium Citrate:**  Acts as a buffer, helping to maintain the pH balance of the formulation and possibly reducing irritation.


This combination is typically used to treat symptoms such as:

* Cough with mucus (productive cough)
* Runny nose
* Sneezing
* Watery eyes
* Congestion


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a frequent side effect of chlorpheniramine maleate.
* **Dry mouth:** A common antihistamine side effect.
* **Nausea:**  Possibly related to ammonium chloride.
* **Headache:**  Can be associated with any of the components.
* **Dizziness:**  Especially with higher doses.
* **Constipation:**  Less common.
* **Stomach upset:** Especially with ammonium chloride.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, serious allergic reactions are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or other signs of an allergic reaction.


**How it Works:**

As detailed in the "Usage" section, each ingredient works through a different mechanism:

* **Guaifenesin:** Increases the volume of respiratory tract fluids, making mucus less viscous and easier to expel.
* **Ammonium Chloride:**  Increases the acidity of respiratory secretions, potentially assisting in thinning mucus (however, its efficacy is debated).
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, reducing allergy-like symptoms associated with colds and upper respiratory infections.
* **Sodium Citrate:** Acts as a buffer to maintain a stable pH and reduce potential irritation.
