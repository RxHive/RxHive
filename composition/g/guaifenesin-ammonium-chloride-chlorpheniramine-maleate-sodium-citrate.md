# Guaifenesin + Ammonium Chloride + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Sodium Citrate
### Generic Name
Guaifenesin + Ammonium Chloride + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Sodium Citrate


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections.  It combines the actions of several active ingredients to address different aspects of these illnesses:

* **Guaifenesin:** This acts as an expectorant, helping to thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up. This is beneficial for relieving congestion in the chest and making breathing easier.

* **Ammonium Chloride:** This ingredient is an expectorant and also contributes to thinning mucus. It works by making the mucus less viscous.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine that helps relieve symptoms associated with allergies and the common cold, such as runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes. By blocking the effects of histamine in the body, it reduces these allergic reactions.

* **Sodium Citrate:** This acts as a buffer, helping to balance the pH of the medication and potentially reducing irritation to the stomach.  It also contributes to thinning the mucus.

The combined effect of these ingredients aims to provide relief from cough, congestion, and other symptoms related to upper respiratory infections.  It's important to understand that this medication *treats symptoms*, not the underlying cause of the infection itself.


### Dosage

Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and age.  There's no single standard dosage as formulations vary.  Always follow the instructions precisely as printed on the product label or as prescribed by a doctor.  The medication is typically available in oral liquid or tablet form.
