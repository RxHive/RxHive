# Gemigliptin

**Generic Name:** Gemigliptin

**Usage:**

Gemigliptin is used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes. It's typically used in combination with diet and exercise, and sometimes with other diabetes medications.  It's not used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, gemigliptin can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects can include:

* **Upper respiratory tract infections:**  Such as colds and the flu.
* **Headache:**  Can range from mild to moderate.
* **Nasopharyngitis:** Inflammation of the nasal passages and pharynx (throat).
* **Diarrhea:** Loose, watery stools.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas):**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe abdominal pain.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:**  Allergic reactions such as rash, itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing.
* **Joint pain:**  Arthralgia.
* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** More likely if used in combination with other diabetes medications, especially insulin. Symptoms include sweating, shakiness, dizziness, and confusion.


**How it Works:**

Gemigliptin belongs to a class of drugs called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors.  It works by increasing the levels of incretins in the body. Incretins are hormones that help the pancreas release insulin when blood sugar levels are high and also reduce the amount of glucose the liver produces. By increasing incretin levels, gemigliptin helps improve blood sugar control.
