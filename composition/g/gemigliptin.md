# Gemigliptin
### Generic Name
Gemigliptin

### Usage
Gemigliptin is primarily used to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, meaning it works by enhancing the body's natural mechanisms for regulating blood sugar.  It's used as an adjunct to diet and exercise. This means it's most effective when combined with lifestyle changes aimed at managing diabetes.  Gemigliptin can be used as monotherapy (the sole medication) or in combination with other diabetes medications, such as metformin, if blood sugar levels aren't adequately controlled with metformin alone.

### Dosage
The standard adult dosage is 50 mg once daily (OD). This dose should not be exceeded.  There are currently no established safe and effective dosages for children under 18 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For patients with mild to moderate liver impairment, no dosage adjustment is typically necessary.  However, for those with severe hepatic impairment, the manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments, and caution is advised.  A doctor should closely monitor these patients.

* **Renal Impairment:**  Patients with mild renal impairment generally do not require dosage adjustment.  However, for those with moderate to severe renal impairment,  the manufacturer's labeling lacks specific dosage recommendations, necessitating careful monitoring by a healthcare professional.

### Side Effects
Common side effects, although not always experienced, may include:

* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Asymptomatic bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine without symptoms)
* Increased serum amylase levels
* Increased serum lipase levels
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and pharynx)
* Urinary tract infection
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Cough
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Urticaria (hives)

Less common, but potentially more serious side effects, include acute pancreatitis and severe arthralgia.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported immediately to a doctor.


### How it Works
Gemigliptin inhibits the DPP-4 enzyme.  DPP-4 normally breaks down incretins, which are hormones that help regulate blood sugar. By blocking DPP-4, Gemigliptin increases the levels of incretins like GLP-1 and GIP.  These increased incretin levels lead to several beneficial effects: increased insulin release when blood sugar is high, decreased glucagon release (a hormone that raises blood sugar), and slowed gastric emptying.  The combined effect is a reduction in blood glucose levels.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Gemigliptin is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to gemigliptin, other DPP-4 inhibitors, or any components of the formulation.
* Diabetic ketoacidosis.
* Type 1 diabetes mellitus.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment, moderate to severe renal impairment,  or NYHA Class II-IV heart failure.
*  Increased risk of severe arthralgia, bullous pemphigoid (a skin condition), and acute pancreatitis has been reported. Patients should be monitored for these conditions.
* Allergic reactions may occur.
*  The drug should be used cautiously in patients with a history of pancreatitis.
