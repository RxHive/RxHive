# Glycopyrrolate + Indacaterol
### Generic Name
Glycopyrrolate + Indacaterol

### Usage
Glycopyrrolate and Indacaterol is a combination medication used for the long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's not used to treat acute symptoms or asthma.  The combination of these two active ingredients works to relax and open the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.

### Dosage

**Adults (COPD):** The medication is available as a dry powder inhaler in two strengths:

* **Lower Strength:**  One capsule (containing 15.6 mcg glycopyrrolate and 27.5 mcg indacaterol) inhaled twice daily (BID).  The maximum daily dose is two capsules.
* **Higher Strength:** One capsule (containing 50 mcg glycopyrrolate and 110 mcg indacaterol) inhaled once daily (OD). The maximum daily dose is one capsule.


**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Glycopyrrolate + Indacaterol in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is usually needed for patients with mild to moderate liver impairment.  For severe impairment, use with caution and monitor closely as dosing adjustments aren't clearly defined in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher. For patients with a GFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis, use with caution, as dosing adjustments are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.


**Administration:** The medication comes in a dry powder inhaler.  Follow the instructions provided with the inhaler carefully.  Do not swallow the capsules; they are for inhalation only.

### How it Works

Glycopyrrolate is an anticholinergic agent that works by blocking the action of acetylcholine in the lungs. Acetylcholine causes the airways to constrict. By blocking acetylcholine, glycopyrrolate helps to relax and open the airways.

Indacaterol is a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA). It works by stimulating beta-2 receptors in the lungs, causing the muscles surrounding the airways to relax and widen, improving airflow.  The combination of these two mechanisms provides a more effective bronchodilation than either drug alone.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Do not use Glycopyrrolate + Indacaterol if you are allergic to glycopyrrolate, indacaterol, or any component of the medication; if you have severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins; or if you are using this medication as monotherapy (without a concomitant inhaled corticosteroid) to treat asthma.

* **Warnings:** This medication carries an increased risk of paradoxical bronchospasm, immediate hypersensitivity reactions, asthma-related death, central nervous system effects, serious effects/fatalities, hypokalemia (low potassium), and hyperglycemia. Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment, convulsive disorders, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, narrow-angle glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, hypokalemia, the elderly, and those with urinary retention.

* **Drug Interactions:** Concurrent use with certain medications, such as potassium supplements, other anticholinergics (e.g., tiotropium), bupropion, donepezil, and digoxin, may increase the risk of adverse effects and should be avoided or carefully managed under a doctor's supervision.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of Glycopyrrolate + Indacaterol during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your doctor to weigh the benefits and risks of using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
