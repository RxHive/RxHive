# Glucagon
### Generic Name
Glucagon

### Usage

Glucagon is primarily used to treat severe hypoglycemia (dangerously low blood sugar).  It acts quickly to raise blood glucose levels by stimulating the liver to release stored glucose. This is crucial in emergency situations where a person is unconscious or severely impaired due to low blood sugar.  It's also used as a diagnostic aid in certain radiological examinations of the gastrointestinal tract, helping to relax the stomach and intestines to improve the quality of images.  Off-label uses include treating refractory anaphylaxis (in patients on beta-blocker therapy) and overdoses of beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.  However, these off-label uses require careful monitoring and should only be considered under the supervision of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the reason for administration, route of administration, and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow the prescribing physician's instructions.  Here's a summary, but this is not a substitute for professional medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **Severe Hypoglycemia (IM, IV, SubQ):** 1 mg.  The dose may be repeated in 15 minutes if needed. IV dextrose should be administered as soon as possible.
* **Severe Hypoglycemia (Intranasal):** 3 mg (one actuation) into a single nostril. The dose may be repeated in 15 minutes if needed using a new device. IV dextrose should be administered as soon as possible.
* **Anaphylaxis (refractory to epinephrine, off-label, IV):** Initial dose of 1-5 mg bolus, followed by an infusion of 5-15 mcg/min.  Titrate the infusion rate to achieve an adequate clinical response.
* **Radiological Exams (IM/IV):** Doses vary depending on the specific exam and area being examined (see product information for details).
* **Beta-blocker or Calcium Channel Blocker Overdose (off-label, IV):** 3-10 mg bolus.  May repeat if no response, then start continuous infusion at 3-5 mg/h, titrating to achieve adequate hemodynamic response.

**Children:**

Dosage for children with severe hypoglycemia is based on weight (typically 0.02-0.03 mg/kg, with a maximum single dose of 1 mg). Intranasal administration in children aged 4 years and older may also be used (3 mg).  For milder hypoglycemia or impending hypoglycemia, a mini-dose regimen is sometimes used; this requires precise calculation based on age and weight and should only be administered under strict medical supervision.   Always refer to the prescribing information for precise pediatric dosing.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, and headache.  Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis)
*   Increased or decreased blood pressure
*   Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
*   Injection site reactions (pain, edema)
*   Altered sense of smell (with intranasal administration)
*   Nasal irritation (with intranasal administration)
*   Necrolytic migratory erythema (rare, but potentially serious skin condition)

If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Glucagon works by binding to receptors on liver cells. This triggers a series of events that lead to the breakdown of glycogen (stored glucose) and the release of glucose into the bloodstream, thus raising blood sugar levels.  It also has effects on the gastrointestinal tract, causing relaxation of smooth muscles.


### Precautions

*   **Allergy:** Do not use glucagon if you are allergic to it or any of its ingredients.
*   **Pheochromocytoma and Insulinoma:** Glucagon is contraindicated in individuals with these conditions.
*   **Hepatic or Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are generally recommended, but close monitoring is advised.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While generally considered safe, discuss use with your doctor during pregnancy or if breastfeeding.
*   **Cardiac Disease:** Use with caution in patients with heart problems.
*   **Adrenal Insufficiency:**  Use with caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Glucagon can interact with other medications, particularly those used to treat diabetes. Inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.
*   **Diabetes Mellitus:**  Close monitoring is needed in diabetic patients.  Supplemental carbohydrates are usually necessary after glucagon administration.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How quickly does glucagon work?**  A: It usually takes effect within 5-15 minutes after injection.
*   **Q: How long does glucagon last?** A: Its effects typically last for about 1-2 hours.
*   **Q: Can I give glucagon to myself?** A: If you have diabetes, your doctor may prescribe a glucagon emergency kit for self-administration or for family members to administer.  However, proper training is essential.
*   **Q: How should glucagon be stored?** A:  Store glucagon as directed on the product label; typically refrigeration is needed.
*   **Q: What should I do if someone doesn't respond to glucagon?** A: Immediately seek emergency medical attention. IV dextrose is needed.
