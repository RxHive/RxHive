# Glucagon

**Generic Name:** Glucagon

**Usage:**

Glucagon is used to treat severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in people with diabetes.  It's particularly crucial in situations where the person is unconscious or unable to swallow oral glucose. It's administered as an emergency medication to rapidly raise blood glucose levels.  It may also be used in certain diagnostic procedures, such as imaging studies of the gastrointestinal tract.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild and short-lived but can include:

* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are common side effects.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** This is less common but can occur.
* **Allergic reactions:** These are rare but can be serious, including rash, itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing.
* **Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar):** This can occur if the dose is too high or if the underlying cause of hypoglycemia isn't addressed.
* **Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat):**  This is a less frequent but potentially serious side effect.
* **Angina (chest pain):** This can occur, especially in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.


**How it Works:**

Glucagon is a hormone naturally produced by the pancreas.  When injected, it stimulates the liver to release stored glucose (glycogen) into the bloodstream. This rapid release of glucose increases blood sugar levels, reversing the effects of hypoglycemia.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is glucagon administered?**  A: Glucagon is typically administered via intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.  It's not given intravenously unless under specific medical supervision.

* **Q: How quickly does glucagon work?** A: Glucagon usually starts working within 5-15 minutes, with peak effects occurring within 10-20 minutes.

* **Q: How long does the effect of glucagon last?** A: The effects of glucagon generally last for about 1-2 hours.

* **Q: Does glucagon have to be refrigerated?** A: Yes, glucagon should be stored in a refrigerator.  Check the specific instructions on your product's packaging.

* **Q: Can glucagon be used to treat high blood sugar?** A: No, glucagon should only be used to treat low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).  Using it to treat high blood sugar could worsen the condition.

* **Q: Who should not use glucagon?** A: Individuals with certain medical conditions, such as pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland) or a known allergy to glucagon should avoid using this medication.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you have any concerns.

* **Q: What should I do after administering glucagon?** A: After administering glucagon, monitor the person's blood sugar levels closely.  Once the person is conscious and able to swallow, provide them with a source of easily digestible carbohydrates to prevent further hypoglycemia.  Seek immediate medical attention regardless of improvement.
