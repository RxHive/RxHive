# Guanidine
### Generic Name
Guanidine

### Usage
Guanidine is primarily used to alleviate muscle weakness symptoms associated with the Eaton-Lambert myasthenic syndrome (LEMS).  It's crucial to understand that guanidine is *not* effective in treating myasthenia gravis, a different neuromuscular disorder.  It works by improving the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles, thereby increasing muscle strength.  This specific effect on neuromuscular transmission makes it a valuable treatment for LEMS, but not for other conditions with similar symptoms.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Eaton-Lambert Syndrome):**  Guanidine is administered orally. The initial dose is typically 10-15 mg/kg/day, divided into 3-4 doses. This dosage is then gradually increased, up to a maximum of 35 mg/kg/day, or until side effects become problematic.  The precise dosage adjustment and monitoring should be guided by a physician based on individual patient response.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of guanidine in children have not been established, and it's not recommended for use in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment due to the potential for increased toxicity. Close monitoring of renal function is essential in these cases.

### Side Effects
Guanidine can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but more serious.  It's crucial to report any adverse effects to your healthcare provider immediately.

* **Common:**  Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, dizziness, nervousness, headache
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Bone marrow suppression (leading to anemia, decreased white blood cells, and low platelets), kidney problems (including acute or chronic interstitial nephritis and renal tubular necrosis), abnormal liver function tests, muscle tremors, hallucinations, psychosis, cardiac arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation and tachycardia),  hypotension.


### How it Works
Guanidine enhances the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter crucial for muscle contraction, at the neuromuscular junction. This increased acetylcholine release improves the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles, resulting in increased muscle strength and a reduction in weakness. It also appears to affect the electrical properties of muscle cell membranes, further contributing to its therapeutic effect in LEMS.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Guanidine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to guanidine or any component of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Guanidine can interact with several other medications.  For instance, concurrent use with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or beta-blockers may increase the risk of adverse effects.  This is due to the additive effects on the cholinergic system.  Itâ€™s essential to inform your physician of all other medications you are currently taking.
* **Warnings:**  Guanidine can cause bone marrow suppression, therefore regular blood tests to monitor blood cell counts are necessary.  It's especially important to monitor renal function closely as kidney problems are a significant risk.  Guanidine is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to potential harm to the fetus or infant.  Older adults may be at increased risk for side effects and require closer monitoring.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Guanidine treatment?** A: The onset of improvement varies from person to person, but noticeable benefits may be observed within a few weeks of starting treatment.  However, optimal therapeutic effects may take longer to achieve.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of Guanidine?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it's almost time for your next scheduled dose.  Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Guanidine?** A: No, it's advisable to avoid alcohol while taking Guanidine, as it can increase the risk of side effects and interact negatively with the medication.

* **Q: How should I store Guanidine?** A: Store Guanidine as directed on the prescription label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of Guanidine?** A: Long-term use of Guanidine can lead to cumulative side effects, particularly related to kidney and bone marrow function.  Regular monitoring by a physician is crucial for early detection and management of any complications.
