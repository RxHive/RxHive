# Golodirsen
### Generic Name
Golodirsen

### Usage
Golodirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide medication used to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients with a confirmed mutation in the *DMD* gene that allows for exon 53 skipping.  This means the medication works only in patients whose genetic defect can be bypassed by removing (skipping) exon 53 from the messenger RNA (mRNA) that codes for the dystrophin protein.  The skipping of exon 53 results in the production of a shortened, but partially functional, dystrophin protein.  This helps to improve muscle function and slow disease progression.  Currently, Golodirsen is only approved for this specific use.

### Dosage

**Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy:**

* **Adults and Children:** The recommended dose is 30 mg/kg administered once weekly as a 35-60 minute intravenous infusion.  The medication should be diluted in normal saline (NS) to a total volume of 100-150 mL and administered through an in-line 0.2-micron filter.  The infusion should be completed within 4 hours.

**Important Dosage Considerations:**

* Before starting Golodirsen, a healthcare professional should assess serum cystatin C levels, perform a urine dipstick test, and measure the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio.  A baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement is also recommended.  These tests are crucial for monitoring kidney function, a potential side effect of the medication.  Urine samples for these tests should be collected before the infusion or at least 48 hours after the last infusion.
*  No dosage adjustments are specified for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment; however, close monitoring is necessary in these cases.
* If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during the infusion, consider slowing the infusion rate or interrupting the treatment.



### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Falling
* Abdominal pain
* Vomiting
* Nausea
* Cough
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Fever


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Pain
* Tachycardia (rapid heartbeat)
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Excoriation (skin abrasion)
* Bruise
* Seasonal allergies
* Influenza
* Catheter-site reaction
* Infusion-site pain
* Back pain
* Bone fracture
* Sprain
* Otic infection (ear infection)
* Oropharyngeal pain (pain in the mouth and throat)
* Rhinitis (runny nose)

**Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (rash, fever, itching, hives, dermatitis, skin exfoliation)
* Kidney toxicity (including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis)


If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed as rare but serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Golodirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide. It works by binding to exon 53 of the pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) for dystrophin.  This binding causes exon 53 to be excluded during mRNA processing.  The result is the production of a shorter, but partially functional, dystrophin protein.  Dystrophin is a crucial protein for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle fibers; the partially functional protein produced by Golodirsen helps to mitigate some of the muscle damage characteristic of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  This mechanism only works in patients with DMD mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Golodirsen can cause hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild to severe. Close monitoring during infusion is essential.
* **Kidney Toxicity:**  Golodirsen carries a risk of kidney toxicity, including potentially life-threatening glomerulonephritis.  Regular monitoring of kidney function is crucial.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of Golodirsen during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Drug Interactions:** Currently, no significant drug interactions have been identified. However, it's always advisable to inform your healthcare provider about all medications and supplements you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Golodirsen administered?** A: Golodirsen is administered intravenously (IV) over 35-60 minutes once weekly.
* **Q: How long does the treatment last?** A: The duration of treatment is determined by your healthcare provider and depends on your individual response to the medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next scheduled dose.  Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q: How should I store Golodirsen?** A: Store Golodirsen according to the instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.
* **Q: Who should not use Golodirsen?** A:  While there are no specific contraindications listed, Golodirsen should only be used in patients with DMD and a mutation amenable to exon 53 skipping.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects, especially serious or unexpected ones.
