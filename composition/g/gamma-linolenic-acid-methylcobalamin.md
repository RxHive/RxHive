# Gamma Linolenic acid + Methylcobalamin

**Generic Name:** Gamma-Linolenic Acid (GLA) + Methylcobalamin

**Usage:**  This combination is not typically used as a single, fixed-dose pharmaceutical product.  GLA and methylcobalamin are often found in supplement form, individually or together, and their usage is based on addressing deficiencies or managing symptoms associated with specific conditions.

* **Gamma-Linolenic Acid (GLA):**  GLA is an omega-6 essential fatty acid with potential benefits for various conditions, including eczema, rheumatoid arthritis, PMS symptoms, and diabetic neuropathy. However, evidence supporting its efficacy in these areas varies.  It's commonly used to reduce inflammation.

* **Methylcobalamin:** This is a form of vitamin B12.  It's crucial for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. It's used to treat or prevent vitamin B12 deficiency, which can lead to anemia, nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy), and cognitive impairment.

Therefore, the usage of a combined GLA and methylcobalamin supplement would depend on the individual's needs and health concerns.  A doctor should always be consulted before using either supplement, especially if already taking other medications.

**Side Effects:**

* **Gamma-Linolenic Acid (GLA):** Side effects are generally mild and may include nausea, diarrhea, upset stomach, and mild headaches. Allergic reactions are possible, especially in individuals allergic to nuts or seeds (as GLA is often derived from evening primrose oil).

* **Methylcobalamin:** Side effects are rare but can include nausea, diarrhea, itching, and skin rash.  High doses can cause some liver issues in rare cases.  While generally considered safe, individuals with specific medical conditions may experience adverse effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Gamma-Linolenic Acid (GLA):** GLA is metabolized into other compounds, including dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1).  DGLA is an anti-inflammatory compound, and PGE1 has several effects, including promoting blood vessel dilation and decreasing blood clotting.  The exact mechanisms by which GLA exerts its therapeutic effects are not fully understood.

* **Methylcobalamin:** Methylcobalamin is the active form of vitamin B12 that the body can readily utilize. It acts as a cofactor in various metabolic processes, including the synthesis of myelin (the protective sheath around nerves), the formation of red blood cells, and DNA replication.
