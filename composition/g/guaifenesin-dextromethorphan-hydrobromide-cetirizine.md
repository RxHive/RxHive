# Guaifenesin + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Cetirizine

**Generic Name:** Guaifenesin + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Cetirizine

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms of the common cold or upper respiratory infections in adults and children (age restrictions vary depending on specific formulation).  It combines the actions of three different active ingredients:

* **Guaifenesin:** An expectorant that helps loosen and thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive) that reduces the urge to cough.  It's effective for dry, non-productive coughs.
* **Cetirizine:** An antihistamine that helps relieve runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes associated with allergies or the common cold.

This combination is intended to address multiple cold symptoms simultaneously.  Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by a doctor or pharmacist.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the specific formulation, but common ones include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a common side effect of both dextromethorphan and cetirizine.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth:**  This is frequently seen with antihistamines.
* **Nausea:**  Less common, but possible.
* **Headache:**  A relatively common side effect.
* **Dizziness:** Particularly associated with dextromethorphan.
* **Constipation:**  Can occur with some formulations.
* **Stomach upset:**  Possible with any of the ingredients.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling) are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.


**How it Works:**

* **Guaifenesin:** Works by increasing the fluid content of the respiratory tract mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
* **Cetirizine:** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction or infection, thus reducing allergy-related symptoms.
