# Gamma-Linolenic Acid
### Generic Name
Gamma-Linolenic Acid (GLA)

### Usage
Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is an essential fatty acid used primarily to address various inflammatory skin conditions.  Its main applications include:

* **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis):** GLA helps reduce inflammation and dryness associated with eczema, improving skin barrier function and reducing itching.
* **Psoriasis:**  GLA may help alleviate the symptoms of psoriasis, such as scaling, redness, and itching, by modulating the inflammatory processes involved in this condition.
* **Systemic Sclerosis:**  In systemic sclerosis, a connective tissue disorder, GLA has shown some promise in improving skin symptoms.

Secondary or investigational uses of GLA include:

* **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Some studies suggest GLA might offer modest benefits in reducing joint pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, although further research is needed.
* **Diabetic Neuropathy:** GLA has been investigated for its potential to alleviate diabetic nerve pain.
* **Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS):**  Some evidence suggests it may help with PMS symptoms, though more robust studies are required.

It's crucial to note that the evidence supporting these secondary uses is less conclusive than for its primary applications in skin conditions.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using GLA for any condition.


### Dosage
The dosage of GLA varies depending on the condition being treated and the form of the supplement (e.g., borage oil, evening primrose oil).  Dosage instructions should always be followed as directed on the product label or by a healthcare professional.  There is no universally accepted standard dosage.

* **Adults:** Typical dosages of GLA for skin conditions may range from 240mg to 720mg per day, often divided into multiple doses.  Specific dosage recommendations vary widely depending on the product's GLA concentration and the individual's condition.
* **Children:**  The use of GLA in children should be guided exclusively by a pediatrician or healthcare provider.  Dosages are not standardized and are highly dependent on the child's age, weight, and specific condition.

GLA is usually taken orally, either as a capsule or in liquid form.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of GLA are generally mild and may include:

* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Heartburn
* Diarrhea
* Headache

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Increased bleeding risk (if taking blood thinners)
* Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)


If you experience any adverse effects, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
GLA is an omega-6 fatty acid that the body converts into substances called prostaglandins and leukotrienes.  These molecules play a critical role in regulating inflammation and cell growth.  By influencing the balance of these substances, GLA helps to:

* **Reduce inflammation:** It promotes the formation of anti-inflammatory prostaglandins, helping to lessen the inflammation associated with conditions like eczema and psoriasis.
* **Improve skin barrier function:** GLA helps restore the skin's protective barrier, reducing dryness and itching.
* **Modulate cell growth:**  In certain conditions, GLA may help regulate abnormal cell growth.


### Precautions
* **Interactions:** GLA may interact with certain medications, particularly blood thinners (anticoagulants) and blood sugar-lowering medications.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist before taking GLA if you are on other medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of GLA during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your doctor before use.
* **Allergies:** Individuals with allergies to plants in the same family as borage or evening primrose may be at risk of allergic reactions.
* **Bleeding disorders:** Due to its potential effect on blood clotting, individuals with bleeding disorders should use caution and consult their physician.
* **Seizures:**  In rare cases, GLA has been associated with seizures; individuals with a history of seizures should consult a doctor.
