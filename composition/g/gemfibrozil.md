# Gemfibrozil
### Generic Name
Gemfibrozil

### Usage

Gemfibrozil is primarily used to treat high levels of triglycerides in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia), specifically Fredrickson types IV and V hyperlipidemia.  This is particularly important for patients at increased risk of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) who haven't seen improvement with diet changes alone.  It also plays a role in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in individuals with Fredrickson type IIb hyperlipidemia.  These patients typically have low levels of "good" cholesterol (HDL), high levels of "bad" cholesterol (LDL), and elevated triglycerides, and haven't responded to diet and other non-drug interventions.  It's crucial to understand that Gemfibrozil is not typically the first or second choice medication for these conditions; other treatments are usually tried first.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical dose is 600 mg twice daily, taken 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner.  Treatment should be stopped if blood lipid levels don't improve after three months.  It's essential to rule out any underlying causes of high lipid levels before starting Gemfibrozil.

**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of Gemfibrozil in children haven't been established, therefore, it's not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's guidelines don't specify dosage adjustments for those with mild to moderate liver or kidney impairment; however, caution is advised.  Severe liver or kidney problems are contraindications to the use of this medication. Some alternative recommendations suggest dose reduction for individuals with reduced kidney function (GFR).  Always consult a doctor for personalized dosage guidance.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Fatigue
* Vertigo (dizziness)
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea and vomiting
* Skin rash (eczema)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat)
* Liver damage (elevated liver enzymes)
* Gallstones (cholelithiasis)
* Muscle damage (myopathy, rhabdomyolysis - a severe form that can be life-threatening)
* Kidney problems (nephrotoxicity)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Allergic reactions (angioedema, severe skin reactions)


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

The precise mechanism of how Gemfibrozil works isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to act in several ways to lower triglyceride levels. It may reduce the production and release of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol (a type of fat in the blood that contributes to high triglycerides) from the liver, and it might also increase the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol).

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Gemfibrozil is contraindicated (should not be used) in people with:

* Allergy to Gemfibrozil or its components
* Severe liver or kidney disease
* Primary biliary cirrhosis (a liver disease)
* Pre-existing gallbladder disease
* Concurrent use with certain medications (see interactions below)
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding (according to Canadian labeling)


**Interactions:** Gemfibrozil can interact with several medications, potentially leading to increased side effects or reduced effectiveness.  These interactions include:

* **Oral anticoagulants (blood thinners):** Gemfibrozil can enhance their effects, increasing the risk of bleeding.
* **Repaglinide (diabetes medication):** Gemfibrozil may increase repaglinide blood levels.
* **Ciclosporin (immunosuppressant):** Gemfibrozil may increase ciclosporin levels and nephrotoxicity risk.
* **HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins):**  Combining Gemfibrozil with statins significantly raises the risk of muscle damage (myopathy and rhabdomyolysis).  This combination should be avoided.
* **Other medications**: Consult your physician or pharmacist for a complete list of medications that may interact with Gemfibrozil.

**Warnings:**

* Monitor liver and kidney function regularly during treatment.
* Regular blood tests (including complete blood count) are recommended, especially during the first year of treatment.
* Be aware of the increased risk of gallstones and muscle problems.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Gemfibrozil?**  A: It usually takes several weeks to see a significant reduction in triglyceride levels.  Treatment should be continued for at least three months to assess effectiveness.

* **Q: Can I take Gemfibrozil with alcohol?** A:  Alcohol can negatively affect liver function, so it's generally advised to limit alcohol consumption while taking Gemfibrozil.  Consult your doctor for guidance.

* **Q: How should I store Gemfibrozil?** A: Store Gemfibrozil as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Gemfibrozil suddenly?** A: No.  Always consult your doctor before stopping Gemfibrozil to ensure a safe and gradual discontinuation.
