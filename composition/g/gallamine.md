# Gallamine
### Generic Name
Gallamine Triethiodide

### Usage
Gallamine triethiodide is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.  Its primary use is to induce skeletal muscle relaxation during general anesthesia for surgical procedures. This allows surgeons to work more easily and effectively during operations.  It's crucial to understand that gallamine itself doesn't provide sedation or pain relief; it only paralyzes muscles. It's always used in conjunction with other anesthetic agents.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage is highly individualized and determined by the anesthesiologist based on patient factors and the specific surgical procedure.

* **Intramuscular (IM) or Intravenous (IV):**
    * **Test Dose:** 20 mg is typically administered to assess for hypersensitivity before proceeding with the full dose.
    * **Initial Dose:** 80-120 mg.
    * **Maintenance Dose:** 20-40 mg intraoperatively as needed to maintain adequate muscle relaxation.

* **Alternative Dosing (IM/IV):**
    * **Initial Dose:** 1 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 100 mg).
    * **Maintenance Dose:** 0.5-1 mg/kg every 30-40 minutes, as required.
    * **Maximum Dose:** 100 mg.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of gallamine triethiodide in pediatric patients have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** Gallamine triethiodide is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.  It should be avoided in patients with renal failure or severe renal impairment due to the risk of prolonged paralysis.


### Side Effects
Gallamine triethiodide can cause a range of side effects, with the frequency of occurrence not always well defined in research.  These can include:

* Elevated blood pressure
* Shock
* Tachyarrhythmia (rapid or irregular heartbeat)
* Hives and other allergic reactions
* Anaphylaxis (severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Apnea (cessation of breathing)
* Bronchospasm (constriction of the airways)


**Serious, though less common, side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention.**  Any unexpected or concerning side effects warrant immediate consultation with a healthcare professional.


### How it Works
Gallamine triethiodide is a competitive, non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. This means it works by blocking the action of acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter vital for muscle contraction.  It binds to the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, preventing ACh from binding and initiating muscle contraction. This leads to muscle paralysis.  It also affects muscarinic receptors, leading to some autonomic effects.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Gallamine triethiodide is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to gallamine or iodine.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients are at increased risk for shock, elevated blood pressure, and allergic reactions.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of gallamine triethiodide during pregnancy and lactation is not established.  Use during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered when the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.  The drug's excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Other Medications:**  Interactions with other medications are possible and should be discussed with a doctor or anesthesiologist.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the effect of gallamine last?** A: The duration of action varies depending on the dose and individual patient factors, but it generally lasts for 20-45 minutes.  However, the recovery from paralysis can be prolonged in patients with renal impairment.

* **Q: Can I drive after receiving gallamine?** A: No.  Gallamine causes significant muscle paralysis. You should not drive or operate machinery until fully recovered and cleared by your doctor.

* **Q: How is gallamine stored?** A:  Gallamine should be stored as directed by the manufacturer's labeling, typically in a cool, dry place, protected from light and moisture.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or a rapid heartbeat.
