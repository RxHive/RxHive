# Glibenclamide
### Generic Name
Glibenclamide (also known as Glyburide)

### Usage
Glibenclamide is a sulfonylurea medication primarily used as an adjunct to diet and exercise to manage blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's crucial to understand that glibenclamide is *not* suitable for people with type 1 diabetes or those experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  Its mechanism involves stimulating the pancreas to release more insulin, helping to lower blood glucose.  While it primarily acts on the pancreas,  glibenclamide may also have extrapancreatic effects that contribute to its blood sugar-lowering action.  It's important to note that long-term effectiveness might depend on the continued function of the beta cells in the pancreas.  It is not a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes and is often used in combination with other diabetes medications or lifestyle changes.


### Dosage
Dosage varies considerably depending on the specific formulation (regular tablets vs. micronized tablets), the patient's response, and other health factors.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

**Adults with Type 2 Diabetes (Oral, Regular Tablets):**

* **Initial Dose:** Typically starts at 2.5-5 mg once daily with breakfast or the first main meal.  More sensitive individuals may begin at a lower dose (1.25 mg/day).
* **Dose Adjustment:**  The dose is gradually increased, usually by increments of no more than 2.5 mg/day at weekly intervals, based on blood glucose monitoring.
* **Maintenance Dose:** Ranges from 1.25 mg to a maximum of 20 mg/day.  Some patients, particularly those on higher doses, might benefit from splitting the daily dose into two administrations.


**Adults with Type 2 Diabetes (Oral, Micronized Tablets):**

* **Initial Dose:** Usually 1.5-3 mg once daily with breakfast or the first main meal;  may start at 0.75 mg/day for sensitive individuals.
* **Dose Adjustment:**  Gradual increases of no more than 1.5 mg/day at weekly intervals, guided by blood glucose levels.
* **Maintenance Dose:**  Ranges from 0.75 mg to a maximum of 12 mg/day.  Splitting the dose might be beneficial for some on higher dosages.


**Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Previously on Insulin:**  Switching from insulin to glibenclamide requires careful titration under medical supervision. The insulin dose is gradually reduced while glibenclamide is introduced, based on the patient’s previous insulin usage and blood glucose response.


**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of glibenclamide in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments for Specific Populations:**  Older adults, those with liver or kidney problems, or debilitated individuals often require lower starting doses and careful monitoring to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. Specific dosage adjustments may not be explicitly available in the manufacturer's labeling for these populations.


**Important Note:** Micronized and regular glibenclamide tablets are not bioequivalent.  Switching between formulations necessitates a readjustment of the dosage under medical supervision.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Gastrointestinal issues (epigastric fullness, heartburn, nausea)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (rash, itching, hives)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Frequency not always defined):**

* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar – a very serious side effect)
* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels)
* Weight gain
* Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells)
* Liver problems (jaundice, hepatitis, hepatic failure)
* Disulfiram-like reaction (a reaction similar to that seen with the drug disulfiram)

**Rare Side Effects (less than 1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Erythema multiforme (a severe skin reaction)
* Exfoliative dermatitis (severe skin peeling)


**Always consult a healthcare professional if any adverse effects occur.**


### How it Works
Glibenclamide is a sulfonylurea that works primarily by stimulating the release of insulin from the beta cells within the pancreas. This increased insulin secretion helps to lower blood glucose levels.  While the immediate effect is clear, the long-term mechanism isn't fully understood. It is thought that  extrapancreatic mechanisms may also contribute to its glucose-lowering effect, particularly over time.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Glibenclamide is contraindicated in individuals with type 1 diabetes, DKA, severe liver or kidney disease, hypersensitivity to sulfonylureas or sulfonamides, and those concurrently taking bosentan.  It should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Glibenclamide interacts with many medications, including but not limited to:  certain antibiotics, beta-blockers, corticosteroids, certain antidepressants, alcohol, and other diabetes medications. These interactions can either enhance or reduce the hypoglycemic effect, requiring careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments.
* **Warnings:**  Patients should be closely monitored for hypoglycemia, particularly older adults, debilitated individuals, and those with impaired liver or kidney function.  The risk of hypoglycemia is increased during periods of illness, stress, strenuous exercise, or changes in diet.
* **Specific Populations:**  Caution is needed in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking glibenclamide suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping glibenclamide can lead to uncontrolled blood sugar levels.  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience hypoglycemia?** A:  Treat hypoglycemia immediately by consuming a fast-acting source of sugar (e.g., glucose tablets, juice).  If symptoms persist, seek medical attention.

* **Q: How should I store glibenclamide?** A: Store glibenclamide as directed on the packaging, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking glibenclamide?** A:  Alcohol can interfere with blood sugar control and should be consumed cautiously, if at all, while taking glibenclamide. Consult your doctor about appropriate alcohol consumption.

* **Q:  Can I take glibenclamide if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: No. Glibenclamide is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Safer alternatives should be used.
