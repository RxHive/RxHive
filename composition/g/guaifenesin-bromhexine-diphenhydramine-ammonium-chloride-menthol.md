# Guaifenesin + Bromhexine + Diphenhydramine + Ammonium Chloride + Menthol
### Generic Name
Guaifenesin + Bromhexine + Diphenhydramine + Ammonium Chloride + Menthol  (Note: This is a combination drug; there isn't one single generic name for this specific combination.)


### Usage

This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, influenza (flu), and other upper respiratory tract infections.  Each component targets a specific symptom:

* **Guaifenesin:** Acts as an expectorant, thinning and loosening mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up. This helps clear congestion in the chest and lungs.
* **Bromhexine:** Also an expectorant, working similarly to guaifenesin to help break down and remove mucus.
* **Diphenhydramine:**  A first-generation antihistamine that primarily works to reduce allergic reactions and inflammation in the respiratory tract, helping alleviate runny nose, sneezing, and itching. It also possesses sedative properties, which can help with nighttime coughing and sleep disturbances caused by respiratory symptoms.
* **Ammonium Chloride:**  An expectorant that helps to liquefy mucus, making it easier to expel.
* **Menthol:** Provides a cooling sensation in the throat and nasal passages, offering temporary relief from irritation and coughing.

This combination is aimed at providing comprehensive relief from multiple symptoms, including cough (productive and non-productive), congestion, runny nose, and throat irritation.  It's important to note that this medication treats *symptoms*, not the underlying cause of the illness.


### Dosage

Dosage for this combination medication will vary depending on the specific formulation (e.g., syrup, tablet, capsule) and the manufacturer.  Always follow the instructions on the product label carefully.  **Never exceed the recommended dosage.**  Dosage information provided on a product label should always supersede general information.  There isn't a universally standardized dosage across all brands or formulations of this combination.  **Consult a doctor or pharmacist for specific dosage instructions for adults and children.**  This combination is generally not recommended for children under the age of six without explicit medical advice.

Less common but serious side effects may include allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.


### How it Works

As detailed in the "Usage" section, each ingredient works through a different mechanism:

* **Guaifenesin and Bromhexine:** Increase the fluidity of mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Diphenhydramine:** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released during allergic reactions, reducing inflammation and some symptoms.
* **Ammonium Chloride:** Increases the amount of fluid in the respiratory tract, thinning the mucus.
* **Menthol:** Creates a cooling sensation, offering some relief from irritation.
