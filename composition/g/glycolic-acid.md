# Glycolic acid
### Generic Name
Glycolic Acid

### Usage
Glycolic acid is primarily used as a topical exfoliant in skincare products.  Its primary use is to treat acne, reducing the appearance of blemishes and preventing future breakouts.  It achieves this by loosening the bonds between dead skin cells, allowing them to shed more easily. This action helps unclog pores, reduce inflammation, and improve skin texture.  

Secondary uses include:

* **Reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles:** By promoting cell turnover, glycolic acid can contribute to a smoother, more youthful complexion.
* **Improving skin tone and texture:** It can help to fade hyperpigmentation (dark spots) and improve the overall appearance of uneven skin tone.
* **Treating keratosis pilaris:** This skin condition, characterized by small, rough bumps, often responds well to glycolic acid treatment.
* **Treating sun damage:** Glycolic acid can help improve the appearance of sun-damaged skin, reducing the visibility of age spots and wrinkles.

It's crucial to understand that glycolic acid doesn't cure underlying skin conditions; it helps improve their appearance and manage symptoms.

### Dosage
Glycolic acid is applied topically, not ingested or injected.  There's no standardized dosage as concentrations vary widely in commercially available products, ranging from a few percent to as high as 70%.  Lower concentrations (around 5-10%) are generally suitable for beginners and sensitive skin. Higher concentrations are typically used by dermatologists for specific treatments under professional supervision.  

**For at-home use:**  Always follow the product instructions carefully.  Start with a low concentration and apply a small amount to a small area of skin to test for any adverse reactions before widespread application.  Generally, application is once or twice daily, depending on the product and skin tolerance.

**For professional use (e.g., peels):**  The concentration and application method (e.g., duration of application) are determined by a dermatologist based on individual needs and skin type.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of topical glycolic acid application include:

* Mild stinging or burning sensation immediately after application.
* Redness or irritation.
* Dryness or flaking of the skin.

Less common, but more serious side effects:

* Severe burning or blistering.
* Allergic reactions (itching, rash).
* Increased sun sensitivity.


If any severe side effects occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Glycolic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA). It works by breaking down the bonds between corneocytes (dead skin cells) in the stratum corneum (the outermost layer of the skin).  This process promotes exfoliation, leading to a reduction in the thickness of the stratum corneum.  By removing the layer of dead skin cells, it allows for improved penetration of other skincare ingredients and stimulates cell turnover, revealing fresher, healthier skin underneath. This process also helps to reduce the appearance of acne, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation.


### Precautions
* **Sun Sensitivity:** Glycolic acid can increase sun sensitivity, making your skin more susceptible to sunburn. Always use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher during the day, especially after applying glycolic acid.
* **Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women:** Consult your doctor before using glycolic acid products, especially during pregnancy or breastfeeding, as research on safety during these periods is limited.
* **Skin Conditions:** Individuals with sensitive skin, rosacea, eczema, or other skin conditions should use glycolic acid with caution and potentially consult a dermatologist before use.
* **Drug Interactions:** There are no known significant drug interactions with topical glycolic acid.
* **Allergies:** Perform a patch test before applying to a larger area to check for any allergic reactions.
* **Avoid the Eye Area:**  Avoid contact with eyes. If contact occurs, rinse immediately with plenty of water.


### FAQs

* **Q: How often should I use glycolic acid?** A: This depends on your skin type and the product's concentration. Start with once or twice a week and gradually increase frequency as tolerated. Always follow the product instructions.

* **Q: Can I use glycolic acid with other skincare products?** A:  Generally, yes, but introduce new products gradually to monitor for any adverse reactions. Avoid using other harsh exfoliants simultaneously.

* **Q: How should I store glycolic acid products?** A: Store in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat.
