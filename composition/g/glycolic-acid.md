# Glycolic acid

**Generic Name:** Glycolic Acid

**Usage:**

Glycolic acid is primarily used as a topical exfoliant in skincare products.  Its uses include:

* **Treating acne:** It helps unclog pores, reducing acne breakouts and preventing future ones.
* **Reducing wrinkles and fine lines:**  By stimulating collagen production and cell turnover, it improves skin texture and reduces the appearance of aging.
* **Improving skin tone and texture:** It fades hyperpigmentation (dark spots) from sun damage or acne scars, leaving skin looking brighter and more even.
* **Treating keratosis pilaris:** This skin condition causes small, bumpy rash, often on the arms and legs. Glycolic acid helps to smooth the skin.
* **Chemical peels:**  Higher concentrations are used by dermatologists in chemical peels for more dramatic results.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild and temporary, but can include:

* **Irritation:**  Redness, burning, stinging, and dryness are common, especially with higher concentrations or frequent use.
* **Increased sun sensitivity:**  Glycolic acid can make skin more vulnerable to sunburn.  Sunscreen use is crucial.
* **Peeling:**  Mild peeling is expected with some formulations, but excessive peeling can indicate irritation.
* **Allergic reactions:** Though rare, allergic reactions are possible.  Patch testing is recommended before widespread use, especially for those with sensitive skin.


**How it Works:**

Glycolic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA).  It works by:

* **Exfoliating the skin:**  It gently dissolves the bonds between dead skin cells, allowing them to shed more easily. This reveals smoother, brighter skin underneath.
* **Stimulating collagen production:**  By promoting cell turnover, it encourages the production of collagen, a protein that provides skin structure and elasticity.
* **Improving skin hydration:**  Glycolic acid can improve the skin's ability to retain moisture.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How often should I use glycolic acid?** A:  This depends on the concentration and your skin's tolerance.  Start with once or twice a week and gradually increase frequency as tolerated.  Always follow product instructions.

* **Q: What concentration of glycolic acid is best for beginners?** A:  Beginners should start with lower concentrations (5-10%).  Higher concentrations (above 10%) are generally for professional use or experienced users.

* **Q: Should I use glycolic acid at night or in the morning?** A:  Most dermatologists recommend using glycolic acid products at night, as it increases sun sensitivity.  Always follow with sunscreen in the morning, regardless of when you apply the glycolic acid.

* **Q: Can I use glycolic acid with other skincare products?** A:  Use caution when combining with other actives like retinoids or benzoyl peroxide, as this can increase irritation.  Introduce new products gradually to assess your skin's reaction.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience irritation?** A:  Stop using the product immediately.  If irritation persists, consult a dermatologist.
