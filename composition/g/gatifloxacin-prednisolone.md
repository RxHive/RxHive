# Gatifloxacin + Prednisolone

**Generic Name:** Gatifloxacin + Prednisolone (combination not commonly found as a single pre-mixed product)

**Usage:**  Gatifloxacin and Prednisolone are *not* typically combined in a single pharmaceutical product.  They are used separately, often for treating similar conditions but targeting different aspects.  Their use together would likely be in the form of separate prescriptions.

* **Gatifloxacin:**  A fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the eyes (conjunctivitis, keratitis) and ears.
* **Prednisolone:** A corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation and allergic reactions in various parts of the body, including the eyes and ears.  Often used to manage inflammatory conditions alongside antibiotics.

Therefore, "usage" depends entirely on the *individual* medication's prescription and the specific infection or condition being treated.  A doctor would prescribe them separately and explain the specific use in that context.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects depend on which medication is used and how it's administered.  Possible side effects include (but are not limited to):

* **Gatifloxacin (ophthalmic):** Burning, stinging, itching, redness, dryness of the eyes, blurred vision, headache.  Rare but serious side effects can include tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy.
* **Prednisolone (ophthalmic):** Increased intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucoma, cataracts, thinning of the cornea, increased risk of infections. Systemic side effects (if absorbed systemically) can include weight gain, mood changes, increased blood sugar, etc.


**How it Works:**

* **Gatifloxacin:**  Interferes with the bacterial DNA replication and repair mechanisms, thus killing bacteria.
* **Prednisolone:**  Suppresses the inflammatory response by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, which reduces the production of inflammatory mediators.
