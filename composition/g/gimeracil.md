# Gimeracil
### Generic Name
Gimeracil

### Usage
Gimeracil is a medication used in the treatment of resectable gastric carcinoma (cancer of the stomach).  It's not used as a standalone treatment but rather as part of a combination therapy.  Its primary function is to enhance the effectiveness of other anticancer drugs, specifically when used in conjunction with tegafur and oteracil potassium.  It doesn't directly kill cancer cells but works by modulating the metabolism of other chemotherapeutic agents, leading to improved outcomes in gastric cancer patients.  Currently, there are no other established uses for gimeracil outside of this specific combination therapy for resectable gastric carcinoma.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  For resectable gastric carcinoma, gimeracil is administered orally.  It's given in combination with tegafur and oteracil potassium at a dose of 40 mg/mÂ² of body surface area (BSA) twice daily. This dosage regimen is typically followed for seven days pre-operatively (before surgery) and continues for an additional 15 days post-operatively (after surgery), starting on day 15 post-op.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of gimeracil in pediatric patients have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in children.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Fatigue
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Sore mouth
* Hair thinning
* Rash
* Loss of appetite
* Changes in taste
* Headaches
* Insomnia
* Brittle nails
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Confusion
* Drowsiness

A serious, though less common, side effect is bone marrow suppression, which can be life-threatening.  Any unusual or concerning side effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Gimeracil's mechanism of action centers around its inhibition of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). DPD is an enzyme that breaks down 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a key component of the anticancer drug tegafur. By inhibiting DPD, gimeracil prevents the rapid breakdown of tegafur-derived 5-FU, leading to increased levels of the active anticancer drug within the body. This higher concentration of 5-FU enhances its ability to target and kill cancer cells, improving the overall effectiveness of the combination therapy.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Gimeracil is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to the drug. It's also contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential harm to the developing fetus or infant.

**Warnings and Precautions:**  Caution should be exercised when administering gimeracil to patients with cardiac, renal (kidney), or hepatic (liver) impairment.  Close monitoring is needed in such cases to adjust the dosage and manage any potential adverse effects.  The drug may interact with warfarin (an anticoagulant), potentially altering INR readings, and with phenytoin (an anticonvulsant), potentially increasing phenytoin blood levels.  Careful monitoring and dose adjustments may be necessary when gimeracil is used concurrently with these medications.


### FAQs

**Q: How is gimeracil stored?**  A:  Storage instructions should be followed as provided by the pharmacist or on the product packaging. Typically, this involves storing the medication at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

**Q: Can I stop taking gimeracil if I feel better?** A: No, it is crucial to complete the prescribed course of gimeracil as directed by your healthcare provider, even if you feel better. Stopping prematurely can compromise the effectiveness of the treatment.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on whether to take it as soon as possible or skip the missed dose entirely, depending on the time elapsed and the overall treatment schedule.  Do not double the dose to compensate for a missed dose.

**Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with gimeracil?** A:  Long-term effects are not yet comprehensively documented, but close monitoring is essential during and after treatment to detect and address any potential long-term complications.  Your healthcare provider can address any specific concerns you may have.
