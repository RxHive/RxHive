* **Breast cancer:** It can be used in premenopausal women with certain types of breast cancer to suppress estrogen production, slowing tumor growth.
* **Endometriosis:**  It can be used to reduce the painful symptoms of endometriosis by suppressing the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus.
* **Uterine fibroids:**  It can shrink uterine fibroids, reducing symptoms like heavy bleeding.
* **Precocious puberty:** It can delay or slow the progression of puberty in children who start puberty too early.

* **Hot flashes:** This is one of the most common side effects.
