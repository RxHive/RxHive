# Gatifloxacin + Ketorolac

There is no commercially available generic combination drug containing Gatifloxacin and Ketorolac.  Gatifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, and Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). While they might be prescribed together in specific situations by a doctor for treating a concurrent bacterial infection and pain/inflammation, they are not formulated as a single combination product.  Therefore, providing details in the requested format about a "generic Gatifloxacin + Ketorolac" is not possible.

To understand the effects and risks, one must consider each drug separately and the potential interactions when used concurrently:

**Gatifloxacin:**

* **Generic Name:** Gatifloxacin
* **Usage:** Treatment of bacterial infections, particularly in respiratory tract, skin, and urinary tract infections.  Its use has become more limited due to safety concerns.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, rash, tendonitis, tendinopathy (including rupture),  QT prolongation (heart rhythm abnormality), photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight), seizures (rare), liver damage (rare).
* **How it Works:** It inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes, essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair, leading to bacterial cell death.

**Ketorolac:**

* **Generic Name:** Ketorolac Tromethamine (often just called Ketorolac)
* **Usage:** Short-term relief of moderate to moderately severe pain.  Often used for post-surgical pain or acute pain.
* **Side Effects:** Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, ulcers, bleeding), kidney problems (especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease), increased risk of bleeding, allergic reactions (rash, swelling), dizziness, headache, drowsiness.
* **How it Works:** It inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are involved in pain and inflammation.
