# Guaifenesin + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Guaifenesin + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Menthol

**Usage:** This combination medication is a multi-symptom cold and cough remedy. It's used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or flu, including:

* **Cough:** Dextromethorphan hydrobromide is a cough suppressant (antitussive) that helps reduce the urge to cough.
* **Chest Congestion:** Guaifenesin is an expectorant that thins and loosens mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Runny Nose & Sneezing:** Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that helps to dry up runny noses and reduce sneezing.
* **Stuffy Nose (to a lesser extent):** While not its primary function, the menthol can provide some temporary relief from nasal congestion through a cooling sensation.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a common side effect of both chlorpheniramine maleate and dextromethorphan hydrobromide.
* **Dry mouth:** This is also common with antihistamines.
* **Dizziness:** Especially with higher doses or in combination with alcohol or other sedatives.
* **Nausea:** Although less common.
* **Headache:**
* **Constipation:**
* **Blurred vision:**
* **Difficulty urinating:**
* **Allergic reactions:**  In rare cases, allergic reactions like rash, itching, or swelling can occur.  Stop use and seek medical attention immediately if this happens.


**How it Works:**

* **Guaifenesin:** Thins and loosens mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up phlegm. It works by increasing the fluid content of the mucus.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This helps to reduce runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex. It doesn't treat the underlying cause of the cough, only the symptom.
* **Menthol:** Provides a cooling sensation, which can temporarily relieve the feeling of stuffiness in the nasal passages.  The mechanism is primarily through localized sensory effects rather than a direct physiological action on nasal congestion.
