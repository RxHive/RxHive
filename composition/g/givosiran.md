# Givosiran
### Generic Name
Givosiran

### Usage
Givosiran is a medication used to treat acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) in adults. AHP is a group of rare inherited disorders that affect the body's ability to process heme, a crucial component of red blood cells.  These disorders can lead to severe attacks of abdominal pain, neurological problems (such as weakness, paralysis, and seizures), and skin problems. Givosiran works by reducing the production of harmful substances that build up in the body during AHP attacks, thus lessening the frequency and severity of these attacks and their associated symptoms.  It's currently approved only for the treatment of AHP;  it's not used to treat other types of porphyria.


### Dosage
The recommended dosage of Givosiran for adults with acute hepatic porphyria is 2.5 mg/kg administered subcutaneously (under the skin) once a month.  Dosage adjustments are possible in cases of elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).  If severe or clinically significant transaminase elevations occur, Givosiran should be discontinued. After improvement in transaminase levels, a reduced dose of 1.25 mg/kg monthly may be restarted and gradually increased to the standard dose if transaminase levels remain normal.  There is no established dosage for children, and its safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.  Dosage adjustments for patients with impaired kidney function are generally not necessary.  The manufacturerâ€™s label does not provide dosage adjustments for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment or end-stage renal disease.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in at least 20% of patients) include nausea and injection site reactions.

Side effects occurring in at least 10% of patients include:

* Rash
* Increased serum creatinine levels
* Elevated serum transaminase levels
* Fatigue

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include anaphylactic reactions and hypersensitivity.  If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed above, it's crucial to consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Givosiran is a type of RNA interference (RNAi) therapy.  It works by targeting a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule called aminolevulinate synthase 1 (ALAS1) mRNA.  ALAS1 is an enzyme involved in the production of heme.  By silencing ALAS1 mRNA, Givosiran reduces the production of porphyrin precursors (like aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen), which are the substances that accumulate in AHP and cause attacks. By lowering the levels of these precursors, Givosiran helps prevent or lessen the severity of AHP attacks.


### Precautions
Givosiran is contraindicated in patients with known severe hypersensitivity to the medication.  There is an increased risk of anaphylaxis, hepatic toxicity (elevated liver enzymes), renal toxicity (increased creatinine levels, decreased GFR), and injection site reactions.  The safety of Givosiran during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  Patients should inform their healthcare provider about all other medications they are taking, as interactions with CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 substrates are possible. Careful monitoring of renal and hepatic function is essential during treatment.
