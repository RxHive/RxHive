# Gefitinib
### Generic Name
Gefitinib

### Usage
Gefitinib is a targeted therapy primarily used in the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Its effectiveness is specifically linked to the presence of certain mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene within the cancer cells.  Specifically, Gefitinib is approved for use in patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations, as confirmed by an FDA-approved test.  It's crucial to understand that Gefitinib's efficacy hasn't been established for NSCLC with other EGFR mutations.

### Dosage
**Adults (Non-small cell lung cancer):** The standard oral dose is 250 mg once daily. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Gefitinib in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are not explicitly outlined in the manufacturer's labeling for hepatic or renal impairment. However,  systemic exposure increases with hepatic impairment, and while minimal renal excretion makes dosage adjustment unlikely in renal impairment, close monitoring is vital.  For various toxicities (dermatological, gastrointestinal, ocular, pulmonary), the medication may need to be temporarily withheld or permanently discontinued depending on the severity.  If a patient is taking strong CYP3A4 inducers, the Gefitinib dose may need to be increased to 500mg daily, then readjusted after the inducer is stopped.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

*   Insomnia
*   Fatigue
*   Diarrhea
*   Anorexia
*   Nausea
*   Decreased appetite
*   Vomiting
*   Stomatitis
*   Constipation
*   Skin rash
*   Dry skin
*   Itching
*   Nail changes
*   Increased levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT)
*   Proteinuria
*   Weakness


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less):**  These include but are not limited to:  peripheral neuropathy,  interstitial lung disease (ILD),  severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis),  hepatic failure, gastrointestinal perforation,  and various other organ-specific toxicities.

**Important Note:** Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Gefitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by blocking the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a protein that plays a critical role in the growth and division of cancer cells.  By inhibiting EGFR, Gefitinib disrupts the signaling pathways that promote cancer cell proliferation, ultimately slowing or stopping tumor growth.  Gefitinib exhibits a higher binding affinity for certain mutated forms of EGFR (exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations) commonly found in lung cancer, explaining its targeted effectiveness.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Gefitinib is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Gefitinib or any component of the formulation.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Gefitinib's metabolism can be affected by certain medications, particularly those that induce or inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme.  Concurrent use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin) may reduce Gefitinib levels, while strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole) may increase them.  Warfarin and other drugs metabolized by the same enzymes should be used with caution.  Drugs that affect gastric pH can also impact Gefitinib absorption.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Gefitinib is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus. Women of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and after treatment.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking Gefitinib.

* **Other Precautions:** Patients with hepatic or renal impairment require close monitoring.  Regular monitoring of liver function tests, kidney function tests, and complete blood counts are essential during treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Gefitinib with food?** A: Gefitinib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Don't take a missed dose if it's within 12 hours of your next scheduled dose.

* **Q: How should I store Gefitinib?** A:  Store Gefitinib as directed on the prescription label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Gefitinib?** A:  No, grapefruit juice may increase Gefitinib levels in the blood, potentially increasing side effects.  Avoid grapefruit juice while on this medication.

* **Q:  What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A:  Serious side effects can include severe skin reactions, liver problems, lung problems (ILD), severe diarrhea, and gastrointestinal perforation.  If you experience any concerning symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.  This is not an exhaustive list, so any unusual or concerning symptoms should be reported to a doctor.
