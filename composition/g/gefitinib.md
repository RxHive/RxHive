# Gefitinib

**Generic Name:** Gefitinib

**Usage:** Gefitinib is a targeted therapy used primarily in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Specifically, it's used in patients whose tumors have an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation.  It may be used as a first-line treatment (initial treatment) or as a second-line treatment (after other treatments have failed).  Its use is generally limited to patients with specific EGFR mutations identified through genetic testing.

**Side Effects:** Gefitinib can cause a range of side effects, varying in severity from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea:**  Often a significant side effect, requiring management with anti-diarrheal medications.
* **Skin rash:**  Can range from mild acne-like eruptions to more severe reactions.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  May require antiemetic medication.
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling tired and weak.
* **Loss of appetite:**  Leading to weight loss.
* **Interstitial lung disease (ILD):** A serious and potentially life-threatening side effect characterized by inflammation and scarring of the lungs.  Requires immediate medical attention.
* **Stomach pain:** Abdominal discomfort.
* **Elevated liver enzymes:** Indicated through blood tests.

Less common but serious side effects include:

* **Pneumonitis:** Inflammation of the lungs.
* **Kidney problems:**  Such as decreased kidney function.


**How it Works:** Gefitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by selectively blocking the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase.  EGFR is a protein found on the surface of some cancer cells, and its activation promotes cancer cell growth and division. By inhibiting EGFR, gefitinib slows or stops the growth of cancer cells that depend on this receptor for survival.  This mechanism of action is why genetic testing for EGFR mutations is crucial before prescribing gefitinib; the drug is most effective in patients with tumors harboring these mutations.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is gefitinib a cure for cancer?** A: No, gefitinib is not a cure for cancer. It is a treatment aimed at slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells, but it does not eliminate all cancer cells.
* **Q: How is gefitinib administered?** A: Gefitinib is typically administered orally as a tablet.
* **Q: What are the potential drug interactions?** A:  Gefitinib can interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some medications may increase the risk of side effects or reduce gefitinib's effectiveness.
* **Q: How long is the treatment course?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the patient's response to the medication and the presence of side effects.  Treatment may continue as long as it is effective and tolerated.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your doctor immediately.  They can adjust the dosage or recommend supportive care to manage side effects.
* **Q:  What is the cost of gefitinib?** A:  The cost of gefitinib varies depending on location, insurance coverage, and the pharmacy.  Generic versions are generally less expensive than brand-name alternatives.
