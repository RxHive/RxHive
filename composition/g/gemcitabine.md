# Gemcitabine
### Generic Name
Gemcitabine

### Usage

Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug used to treat several types of cancer.  Its primary use is in the treatment of advanced cancers where other treatments have failed or are unsuitable.  Specifically, it's approved for:

* **Metastatic breast cancer:** Often used in combination with paclitaxel, especially after treatment with anthracyclines (a different type of chemotherapy).
* **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):** Used in combination with cisplatin for inoperable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease.
* **Advanced ovarian cancer:** Used in combination with carboplatin, typically after the cancer has relapsed at least six months after previous platinum-based chemotherapy.
* **Pancreatic cancer:**  Used as a first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, particularly in patients who have previously received fluorouracil.

While the above are FDA-approved uses, gemcitabine is also sometimes used off-label (meaning it's used for conditions not officially approved by regulatory bodies) in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for various other cancers, including bladder, cervical, and others.  These off-label uses should only be considered under the guidance of an oncologist experienced in managing such complex treatment regimens.


### Dosage

Gemcitabine dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the type of cancer being treated, the patient's overall health, and their body surface area (BSA), calculated from height and weight.  The medication is typically administered intravenously (IV).  **It is crucial to follow a physician's precise instructions as dosage variations are substantial depending on the cancer and combination therapies involved.**

**Examples of IV dosage regimens (not exhaustive, and off-label uses are not covered here completely):**

* **Metastatic Breast Cancer (in combination with paclitaxel):**  1250 mg/m² over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, repeated every 21 days.
* **Advanced Ovarian Cancer (in combination with carboplatin):** 1000 mg/m² over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, repeated every 21 days.
* **Pancreatic Cancer:**  Dosage regimens for pancreatic cancer are complex and vary significantly; common regimens include 1000 mg/m² once weekly for 7 weeks, followed by a one-week rest, then administered on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Gemcitabine is used in some pediatric cancer treatments but with significantly different dose calculations based on the child's age, weight, and the specific cancer.  These dosages are determined by a pediatric oncologist and are not detailed here due to their complexity and variability.

**Important Note:**  The information provided here is a summary and should not be considered a substitute for detailed instructions from a healthcare professional.  The specific dosage and administration method will be determined by your oncologist.


### Side Effects

Gemcitabine, like most chemotherapy drugs, can cause side effects. These range from mild to severe.  **It's crucial to report any unusual symptoms to your doctor immediately.**

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Increased liver enzyme levels


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS – kidney failure)
* Pulmonary toxicity (lung problems)
* Severe liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Capillary leak syndrome (fluid leakage from blood vessels)
* Cardiac problems


### How it Works

Gemcitabine is a type of antimetabolite chemotherapy drug. It works by interfering with the way cancer cells make DNA and RNA, the building blocks of cells.  Specifically:

1. **Phosphorylation:**  Gemcitabine is converted into active forms within the cancer cells.
2. **DNA Inhibition:** These active forms interfere with DNA polymerase, an enzyme crucial for DNA replication. This prevents the cancer cells from replicating their DNA.
3. **RNA Inhibition:** The drug also inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, which is essential for making the building blocks of RNA, affecting protein synthesis.
4. **Cell Death:** By blocking DNA and RNA synthesis, gemcitabine ultimately leads to the death of cancer cells.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Gemcitabine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with a known allergy to it or its components.
* **Bone Marrow Suppression:** Gemcitabine can suppress bone marrow function, leading to low blood cell counts (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia). Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor this.
* **Organ Function:**  Kidney and liver function should be carefully monitored, as gemcitabine can affect these organs.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Gemcitabine is categorized as pregnancy category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for several months afterward. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Gemcitabine may interact with other medications. It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Other Precautions:**  The use of gemcitabine requires careful monitoring for potential serious side effects such as capillary leak syndrome, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and pulmonary toxicity.


### FAQs

* **How is gemcitabine administered?**  It's typically administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional.
* **How long does treatment last?**  The duration of treatment varies depending on the type of cancer and response to therapy.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Report all side effects to your doctor immediately.  They can adjust the dosage or provide supportive care to manage them.
* **How is gemcitabine stored?**  Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking gemcitabine?**  Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor; alcohol may interact negatively with gemcitabine or other medications you might be taking concurrently.
* **Are there alternative treatments?**  Yes, many other chemotherapy drugs and treatment options exist for the cancers gemcitabine treats; the best approach depends on your individual situation and will be determined by your doctor.
