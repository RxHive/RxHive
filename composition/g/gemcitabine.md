**How it Works:** Gemcitabine is a type of antimetabolite chemotherapy drug. It works by interfering with the growth and reproduction of cancer cells.  Specifically, it's a nucleoside analog that gets incorporated into the DNA of cancer cells, disrupting their ability to replicate and ultimately leading to cell death.  It's more effective against rapidly dividing cells, which is why it targets cancer cells.
