# Gilteritinib
### Generic Name
Gilteritinib

### Usage
Gilteritinib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Its use is specifically indicated for AML patients who have a mutation in the <i>FLT3</i> gene, as confirmed by an FDA-approved test.  This mutation is a common genetic abnormality in AML and contributes to the disease's progression. Gilteritinib works by targeting and inhibiting the activity of the FLT3 protein, thereby helping to control the growth and spread of leukemia cells.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The standard oral dose for adults with relapsed or refractory FLT3-positive AML is 120 mg once daily. Treatment continues for at least six months, or until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Gilteritinib in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are generally not needed for mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment. However, in cases of severe side effects, such as differentiation syndrome, pancreatitis, QT prolongation, or other grade 3 or higher toxicities, dose reduction (to 80 mg once daily) or temporary interruption of treatment may be necessary under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Specific management strategies for these adverse effects are outlined below in the "Precautions" and "Side Effects" sections.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Insomnia
*   Hypotension or Hypertension
*   Diarrhea
*   Constipation
*   Nausea
*   Stomatitis (mouth sores)
*   Vomiting
*   Abdominal pain
*   Decreased appetite
*   Altered taste (dysgeusia)
*   Rash
*   Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
*   Cough
*   Pneumonia or other infections (such as sepsis)
*   Muscle or joint pain (myalgia/arthralgia)
*   Kidney problems (renal impairment)

*   Fever
*   Edema (swelling)
*   Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP)
*   Changes in blood sugar, calcium, triglycerides, albumin, potassium, sodium, phosphorus, and creatine kinase levels.


**Less Common, But Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less frequent):**

*   Differentiation syndrome (a potentially life-threatening complication)
*   Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
*   QT interval prolongation (which can lead to abnormal heart rhythms)
*   Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
*   Cardiac failure
*   Pericardial effusion (fluid around the heart)
*   Pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium)
*   Anaphylactic reactions

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Gilteritinib is a type of medication called a kinase inhibitor. It works by specifically targeting and blocking the activity of the FLT3 enzyme, a protein that plays a crucial role in the growth and survival of leukemic cells, particularly those with the <i>FLT3</i> mutation. By inhibiting FLT3, Gilteritinib disrupts the signaling pathways that promote leukemia cell proliferation and survival, leading to a reduction in the number of cancer cells.  It also induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in these abnormal cells.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Gilteritinib is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.
*   **Differentiation Syndrome:** Gilteritinib carries a boxed warning regarding differentiation syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by fever, respiratory distress, fluid buildup, and other symptoms.  Close monitoring and prompt treatment with corticosteroids are crucial if this occurs.
*   **QT Prolongation:** Gilteritinib can prolong the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), increasing the risk of abnormal heart rhythms.  ECG monitoring is often recommended.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Gilteritinib can harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least six months afterward.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for at least two months following the final dose.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Gilteritinib can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by the liver enzymes CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp).  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
*   **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** While generally not requiring dose adjustments for mild to moderate impairment, close monitoring is advised in patients with liver or kidney problems.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How should I store Gilteritinib?**  A: Store Gilteritinib tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and light, as directed on the label.
*   **Q: Can I take Gilteritinib with food?** A: Gilteritinib can be taken with or without food.
*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day, provided it is at least 12 hours before the next scheduled dose. Don't take two doses within 12 hours.  Return to the regular schedule the next day.
*   **Q:  What are the long-term effects of Gilteritinib?** A: Long-term effects vary by individual.  Regular monitoring and follow-up care are essential to assess for any late-emerging effects.  Discuss long-term concerns with your oncologist.
*   **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking Gilteritinib?** A: There aren't specific dietary restrictions, but maintaining a healthy diet is recommended to support overall well-being during treatment.
