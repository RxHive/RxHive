# Ginkgo biloba extract EGb
### Generic Name
Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761® (Note:  EGb 761® is a specific standardized extract; other Ginkgo biloba extracts may not have the same composition or efficacy.)

### Usage
Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761® is primarily used to improve cognitive function and memory in individuals with mild cognitive impairment.  It's also sometimes used to treat symptoms of dementia, although the evidence supporting its efficacy in this area is less conclusive than for mild cognitive impairment.  Some studies suggest potential benefits in treating tinnitus (ringing in the ears), intermittent claudication (leg pain due to poor circulation), and certain types of dizziness.  However,  more high-quality research is needed to confirm these secondary uses. It's crucial to understand that Ginkgo biloba is not a cure for these conditions but may offer some symptomatic relief.

### Dosage
Dosage recommendations for Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761® vary depending on the specific product and the condition being treated.  Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional or on the product label.  

Generally, for cognitive function improvement, the recommended dosage for adults is 80-240 mg of EGb 761® extract per day, divided into two or three doses.  There are no established safe and effective dosages for children, and its use in children is generally not recommended due to a lack of research.  IV administration is not applicable for Ginkgo biloba. The extract is usually available in capsule or tablet form.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Upset stomach
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Diarrhea

Less common, but more serious side effects may occur and require immediate medical attention:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Increased risk of bleeding (especially when taken with anticoagulants)
* Interactions with other medications (see Precautions)


If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761® contains various bioactive compounds, including flavonoid glycosides and terpene lactones.  These compounds are thought to work by improving blood circulation, particularly in the brain and extremities. Improved blood flow may enhance the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to tissues, potentially leading to improvements in cognitive function and addressing symptoms related to poor circulation. The exact mechanisms by which Ginkgo biloba affects cognitive function are still under investigation.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Ginkgo biloba should be avoided by individuals with bleeding disorders or those taking anticoagulants (blood thinners) due to an increased risk of bleeding. It should also be avoided before surgery due to increased bleeding risk.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid Ginkgo biloba unless specifically advised otherwise by their physician due to a lack of safety data.

* **Drug Interactions:** Ginkgo biloba can interact with numerous medications, including anticoagulants (warfarin, aspirin), antiplatelet drugs, and antidepressants.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking before starting Ginkgo biloba.

* **Other Precautions:**  Ginkgo biloba may increase sensitivity to sunlight.  Start with a low dose and gradually increase it as tolerated.  Some individuals may experience allergic reactions.
