# Ginkgo biloba extract EGb

**Generic Name:** Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761® (Note:  EGb 761® is a specific standardized extract, not all Ginkgo biloba extracts are the same.)

**Usage:**  EGb 761® is primarily used to improve cognitive function, particularly in individuals experiencing memory impairment associated with age-related cognitive decline or dementia.  It's also sometimes used to treat peripheral vascular disease (PVD), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and intermittent claudication (leg pain during exercise).  However, the evidence supporting its effectiveness for these conditions is less robust than for cognitive function.  It's important to note that EGb 761® is not a cure for these conditions but may offer some symptomatic relief.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using it, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.

**Side Effects:**  EGb 761® is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur. These are usually mild and include:

* Headache
* Upset stomach
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Increased risk of bleeding (due to its effects on blood clotting;  this is particularly relevant for individuals taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications).


**How it Works:** The exact mechanisms by which EGb 761® exerts its effects are not fully understood. However, it's believed to act through several pathways:

* **Improved blood circulation:**  It's thought to improve blood flow to the brain and other tissues, potentially enhancing oxygen and nutrient delivery.  This is attributed to its effects on blood vessel dilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation.
* **Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties:**  Ginkgo biloba contains various compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which may protect brain cells from damage caused by free radicals and inflammation.
* **Neuroprotection:**  Some studies suggest that EGb 761® may protect nerve cells from damage and promote neuronal survival.
