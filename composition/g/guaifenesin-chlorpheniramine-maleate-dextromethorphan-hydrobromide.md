# Guaifenesin + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Generic Name:** Guaifenesin + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to temporarily relieve symptoms of the common cold or flu.  Specifically, it addresses:

* **Guaifenesin:**  Helps loosen congestion in your chest and throat, making it easier to cough up mucus.  It's an expectorant.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  Reduces runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes. It's an antihistamine.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Suppresses cough. It's a cough suppressant.

This medication is typically used for short-term relief of these symptoms. It's important to follow the dosage instructions on the label carefully and not exceed the recommended dose.  It's not intended for long-term use.  Consult a doctor if symptoms persist or worsen after several days.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is particularly common with chlorpheniramine and can also be caused by dextromethorphan at higher doses.
* **Dry mouth:**  This is a frequent side effect of antihistamines.
* **Constipation:**  A potential side effect, especially with higher doses.
* **Nausea:** Less common but possible.
* **Dizziness:**  Can occur, especially when getting up from a lying or sitting position.
* **Headache:**  A possible side effect.
* **Irritability:** Particularly in children.

More serious, though less frequent, side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).
* Fast or irregular heartbeat.
* Seizures.
* Severe dizziness or lightheadedness.

**How it Works:**

* **Guaifenesin:**  Thins and loosens mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This helps to reduce runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:**  Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
