# Glycerol Phenylbutyrate
### Generic Name
Glycerol Phenylbutyrate

### Usage
Glycerol phenylbutyrate is a medication used for the long-term management of urea cycle disorders (UCDs).  UCDs are inherited metabolic conditions where the body is unable to properly process ammonia, a toxic byproduct of protein metabolism.  This build-up of ammonia can lead to serious health problems, including brain damage. Glycerol phenylbutyrate helps to remove excess ammonia from the body. It's crucial to understand that this medication is not a treatment for acute (sudden, severe) hyperammonemia episodes; it's for ongoing management. Glycerol phenylbutyrate works best in conjunction with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, amino acid supplementation.  The aim is to keep ammonia levels within a safe range.


### Dosage
Dosage of glycerol phenylbutyrate varies significantly depending on several factors, making it crucial to follow a healthcare professional's precise instructions.  The following is general information and should *not* be interpreted as a prescription.

**Adults:**

* The maximum daily dose is typically 17.5 mL (19 g).  This amount is divided into 3 equal doses throughout the day.
* For individuals starting glycerol phenylbutyrate (phenylbutyrate-naïve), the starting dose is calculated based on body surface area (BSA), ranging from 4.5-11.2 mL/m²/day (5-12.4 g/m²/day).  The starting dose also considers residual urea synthetic capacity, dietary protein needs, and adherence to dietary restrictions. A useful initial estimate is 0.6 mL of glycerol phenylbutyrate per gram of dietary protein consumed daily.
* Switching from sodium phenylbutyrate:  The dose conversion requires careful calculation to ensure the same amount of phenylbutyric acid is received.  Specific conversion equations are needed, and consulting a healthcare professional is vital.

**Children:**

* Children under 2 years old:  The dose is divided into 3 or more equal doses, each rounded up to the nearest 0.1 mL.
* Children 2 years and older:  The same considerations as adults apply regarding maximum daily dose (17.5 mL/day, divided into 3 equal doses) and BSA-based calculations for initial dosing in phenylbutyrate-naïve patients.


**Administration:**  Glycerol phenylbutyrate is usually taken orally, preferably with food. It can be administered via nasogastric or gastrostomy tubes if swallowing is difficult.  However, careful monitoring of ammonia levels is essential in these cases.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are frequently needed based on plasma ammonia levels, urinary phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN) levels, and plasma phenylacetate (PAA) levels. A healthcare professional will monitor these levels closely and adjust the dosage accordingly to maintain safe ammonia levels and manage potential side effects.  Dosage adjustments might also be necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Headache
* Diarrhea
* Flatulence (gas)
* Fatigue
* Abdominal pain
* Decreased appetite
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities)
* Seizures
* Tremor
* Body odor (from hair, skin, urine)
* Burning mouth sensation
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Gag reflex
* Retching

If any side effects occur, particularly serious ones, it's vital to consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Glycerol phenylbutyrate is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into an active form in the body. It's metabolized into phenylbutyrate, then phenylacetate.  Phenylacetate binds to glutamine, forming phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN). PAGN is then excreted in the urine, effectively removing excess nitrogen from the body, which helps lower ammonia levels. This process substitutes for the body's natural urea cycle, bypassing the metabolic defect in UCDs.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Glycerol phenylbutyrate is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to it or any of its components.
* **Interactions:**  Glycerol phenylbutyrate can interact with other medications, such as corticosteroids (which can increase ammonia levels), valproic acid and haloperidol (which can induce hyperammonemia), and probenecid (which can inhibit the excretion of glycerol phenylbutyrate metabolites). Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in individuals with pancreatic insufficiency, intestinal malabsorption, renal or hepatic impairment, and in elderly patients.  Close monitoring is essential in these populations.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Glycerol phenylbutyrate is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning the risk to the fetus is not fully understood.  Breastfeeding is not recommended due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the infant.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I stop taking glycerol phenylbutyrate if I feel better?**

A: No.  This medication is for long-term management of UCDs. Stopping without consulting a healthcare provider can lead to dangerous ammonia buildup.

**Q: How should I store glycerol phenylbutyrate?**

A: Store it as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for the next dose. Don't double up on doses.

**Q: Are there any dietary restrictions I need to follow?**

A: Yes. Glycerol phenylbutyrate is typically used in conjunction with a protein-restricted diet and possibly amino acid supplementation.  Your healthcare provider will provide specific dietary recommendations.

**Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking glycerol phenylbutyrate?**

A: It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor. Alcohol can have several interactions with medications and may complicate the management of your condition.

**Q:  What if I experience a severe side effect?**

A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Contact your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.
