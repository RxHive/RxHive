# Guaifenesin + Ambroxol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Guaifenesin + Ambroxol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine + Menthol

**Usage:** This combination drug is typically used to relieve symptoms of the common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections.  The specific purpose of each ingredient is:

* **Guaifenesin:**  A expectorant that helps to loosen and thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.
* **Ambroxol:** Another expectorant that helps to thin mucus and improve its clearance from the airways.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that helps to reduce runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes associated with allergies or the common cold.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.
* **Menthol:** A topical analgesic that provides a cooling sensation and may help to soothe irritated throat and nasal passages.

This combination is intended for symptomatic relief only and does not treat the underlying cause of the infection.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects may include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is especially common with chlorpheniramine.
* **Dry mouth:**  A common side effect of antihistamines.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Insomnia (sleeplessness):** Particularly with phenylephrine if taken late in the day.
* **Increased heart rate:**  More likely with phenylephrine.
* **High blood pressure:**  More likely with phenylephrine.
* **Constipation:**
* **Allergic reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing are possible.


**How it Works:** Each ingredient works through a different mechanism to address specific cold symptoms:

* **Guaifenesin and Ambroxol:** Increase mucus clearance by thinning the mucus.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released during allergic reactions, reducing symptoms like runny nose and sneezing.
* **Phenylephrine:** Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Menthol:** Provides a cooling sensation, potentially offering some relief from throat irritation.
