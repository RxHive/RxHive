# Glycopyrrolate + Formoterol Fumarate
### Generic Name
Glycopyrrolate + Formoterol Fumarate

### Usage

Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol fumarate is a combination inhaler used for the long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's not indicated for the treatment of asthma. This combination therapy works by addressing two key aspects of COPD:  Glycopyrrolate, an anticholinergic, relaxes the muscles in the airways, and Formoterol fumarate, a long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist (LABA), also opens the airways. This dual action helps improve breathing and reduce symptoms.


### Dosage

**Adults (COPD):** The usual dose is two inhalations (containing 9 mcg glycopyrrolate and 4.8 mcg formoterol fumarate per inhalation) twice daily via oral inhalation using a metered-dose inhaler (MDI).  The maximum recommended dose is two inhalations twice daily.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised, and close monitoring is essential in patients with liver problems, as drug exposure may be increased.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Cardiovascular: Chest pain
* Nervous System: Anxiety, dizziness, fatigue, headache, falls
* Gastrointestinal: Vomiting, dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Genitourinary: Urinary tract infection
* Hematologic/Oncologic: Bruising
* Infection: Influenza, tooth abscess
* Musculoskeletal: Joint pain (arthralgia), limb pain, muscle spasms
* Respiratory: Cough, acute sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain


**Less Common/Serious Side Effects:**

* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Urinary retention

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Glycopyrrolate blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that causes airway constriction. By blocking acetylcholine, glycopyrrolate helps relax the muscles in the airways, making breathing easier.  Formoterol stimulates beta-2 receptors in the lungs, leading to increased production of cyclic AMP. This increased cyclic AMP relaxes the airway muscles and further improves airflow.  The combined effect of these two drugs provides more effective bronchodilation than either drug alone.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate should not be used by individuals with hypersensitivity to glycopyrrolate, formoterol, or any component of the formulation.  It should not be used as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid) to treat asthma.

* **Interactions:** Avoid concurrent use with other anticholinergics, long-acting beta-2 agonists, nonselective beta-blockers, and several other medications (consult your physician or pharmacist for a complete list).

* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (arrhythmias, coronary insufficiency, hypertension), narrow-angle glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, seizure disorders, or urinary retention.  Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should be monitored closely.


* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate is classified as Category C during pregnancy. Beta-agonists may affect uterine contractility during labor.  The impact on breast milk is unknown, requiring careful consideration of risks and benefits before use during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store my inhaler?** A: Store your inhaler as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from direct heat and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I use this inhaler if I have asthma?** A:  No, this medication is not approved for use in asthma.  Consult your physician for appropriate asthma treatment.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience paradoxical bronchospasm?** A:  Stop using the inhaler immediately and contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention. This is a serious adverse reaction.

* **Q: How long will it take to feel the effects?** A: The onset of action varies, but many patients experience improved breathing within minutes of using the inhaler.  The full therapeutic effect may take longer to develop.  Always follow your physician's instructions and recommendations.
