# Glutathione

**Generic Name:** Glutathione (Reduced Glutathione, L-Glutathione)

**Usage:**

Glutathione is primarily used as a dietary supplement, not a medication approved for specific disease treatment by major regulatory bodies like the FDA.  Its purported uses include:

* **Antioxidant:**  Supporting the body's natural antioxidant defense system.  Proponents believe it helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals.
* **Liver Support:**  Aiding in detoxification processes in the liver.
* **Immune System Support:**  Boosting the immune system's function.
* **Skin Health:**  Improving skin tone, reducing wrinkles, and lightening hyperpigmentation (although evidence for this is limited).


**It is crucial to note that while these uses are often claimed, high-quality clinical evidence supporting many of these benefits is lacking or limited to small studies.**  More research is needed to confirm the efficacy of glutathione for these purposes.


**Side Effects:**

Generally considered safe when taken orally at recommended doses. However, potential side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Stomach upset

More serious side effects are rare but possible, especially with intravenous administration.  These can include allergic reactions.


**How it Works:**

Glutathione is a tripeptide (a molecule made of three amino acids: cysteine, glycine, and glutamate) naturally produced in the body. It functions as a potent antioxidant, neutralizing harmful free radicals and protecting cells from oxidative stress. It also plays a role in various metabolic processes, including detoxification and immune function.  The exact mechanisms of its purported benefits beyond its antioxidant role are not fully understood.  Oral glutathione has poor bioavailability (meaning the body doesn't absorb a large amount), leading to questions about its effectiveness when taken as a supplement.  Intravenous administration is sometimes used, but this is typically only done under medical supervision due to the potential for side effects.


**FAQs:**

* **Is glutathione effective?** The effectiveness of oral glutathione supplements is debated due to low bioavailability. While it has antioxidant properties, the clinical evidence supporting many of its claimed health benefits is limited and requires further research.

* **What are the different forms of glutathione?** Reduced glutathione (GSH) is the most active form.  Other forms exist, such as oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and S-acetyl glutathione, each with varying bioavailability and efficacy.

* **Is glutathione safe?** Generally considered safe at recommended oral doses, but potential side effects exist.  Consult a doctor before taking glutathione supplements, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.

* **How much glutathione should I take?** There's no universally recommended dosage.  Supplement labels provide guidance, but it's best to consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dose based on individual needs and health status.

* **Can I get glutathione from food?**  Some foods are rich in precursors to glutathione synthesis (the amino acids it is made of).  However, consuming these foods doesn't guarantee increased glutathione levels in the body.
