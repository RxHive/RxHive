# Glutathione
### Generic Name
Glutathione

### Usage
Glutathione is primarily used to help prevent and manage nerve damage (neurotoxicity) caused by cisplatin or other similar platinum-based chemotherapy drugs.  It's an antioxidant that's believed to mitigate some of the toxic effects of these powerful cancer treatments.  While its main use is in this context, research into its potential benefits in other areas is ongoing.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific treatment plan and the severity of the neurotoxicity being addressed.  There's no standard pediatric dosage established.

**Adult Dosage (for chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity):**

* **Intramuscular (IM) or Intravenous (IV):** The usual dose ranges from 300 to 600 mg per day. Patients experiencing severe symptoms might require higher doses, between 600 and 1200 mg per day.  

* **Alternate Dosing (off-label):**  Some clinicians may use alternative regimens.  These often involve a higher initial IV dose (e.g., 1.5 g/mÂ² ) given immediately before each cisplatin infusion, followed by lower daily IM doses (e.g., 600 mg for several days) or a single high-dose IV regimen.  Similar regimens might be employed with oxaliplatin.

**Important Note:** These dosages are for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as medical advice.  The appropriate dose and administration method will always be determined by a qualified oncologist or healthcare professional based on individual patient needs and the specific chemotherapy regimen.


### Side Effects
Common side effects, though the frequency isn't definitively established, can include:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis in rare cases)

Serious side effects, while less common, are possible and warrant immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Glutathione is a naturally occurring antioxidant composed of three amino acids: L-cysteine, L-glutamic acid, and glycine.  The body produces it naturally, and it plays a crucial role in various cellular processes.  In the context of chemotherapy, it's hypothesized that glutathione's ability to bind to heavy metals like those found in cisplatin reduces the drug's harmful effects on nerve cells, potentially lessening the severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:**  There's a potential risk of hypersensitivity reactions or even anaphylactic shock.  Patients with a history of allergies should be carefully monitored.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The effects of supplemental glutathione during pregnancy and breastfeeding aren't fully known.  While glutathione is naturally present in breast milk, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider before using this medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not currently provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with impaired liver or kidney function.  Healthcare professionals should exercise caution and consider potential adjustments based on individual patient circumstances.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Interactions with other medications haven't been fully documented. Always disclose all medications (prescription and over-the-counter) and supplements to your healthcare provider.

### FAQs
* **Q: Is glutathione a cure for chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity?** A: No, it's a supportive therapy aimed at reducing the severity of neurotoxicity, not a cure.

* **Q: How is glutathione administered?** A: Typically administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM), as directed by a healthcare professional.

* **Q: How should I store glutathione?** A: Storage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation. Follow the instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.

* **Q:  Are there any long-term side effects associated with glutathione?** A:  Long-term effects are not fully established.  It's important to discuss any concerns with your physician.

* **Q: Can I take glutathione supplements to prevent chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity?** A:  The use of supplemental glutathione for this purpose should only be discussed with and guided by an oncologist or other qualified healthcare provider.  The dosage and safety of supplemental glutathione in this context haven't been fully established.
