# Guselkumab
### Generic Name
Guselkumab

### Usage
Guselkumab is a medication used to treat moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.  It's also approved for treating active psoriatic arthritis in adults.  In essence, it targets the underlying inflammatory processes driving these conditions. While primarily used for these two conditions, ongoing research may explore its potential in other related autoimmune diseases.

### Dosage
Guselkumab is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) with a pre-filled pen or syringe.

* **Plaque Psoriasis:** The typical dose is 100 mg given at weeks 0 and 4, followed by a dose every 8 weeks thereafter.

* **Psoriatic Arthritis:**  The dosage is the same as for psoriasis: 100 mg at weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks. It can be used alone or in combination with other medications (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, or DMARDs, like methotrexate).

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Guselkumab in children under 18 have not been established.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not specified in current guidelines.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include infections (mostly mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections) and injection site reactions.  Other side effects, occurring in 1-10% of patients, may include headache, bronchitis, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, decreased neutrophils (a type of white blood cell), increased liver enzyme levels, and the development of antibodies against Guselkumab. Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include allergic reactions (such as anaphylaxis), serious infections, and skin rashes.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-23 (IL-23), a protein involved in inflammation and immune responses. By binding to IL-23, Guselkumab blocks its activity, reducing the inflammation that contributes to psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.  This leads to improvements in skin lesions and joint symptoms.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Guselkumab is contraindicated in individuals with a known serious hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.  There's an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.
* **Infections:** Guselkumab may increase the risk of infections. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection.  Live vaccines should be avoided during treatment.  Prior TB screening is important, and latent TB should be treated before starting Guselkumab.
* **Immunosuppression:** Guselkumab can affect the immune system; therefore, its use should be carefully considered in individuals with weakened immune systems.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Other treatment options are usually preferred during pregnancy. The excretion of Guselkumab in breast milk is unknown, so the decision to breastfeed while using this medication should be made in consultation with a doctor, weighing the risks and benefits for both mother and infant.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The onset of improvement can vary, but many patients experience noticeable benefits within several weeks of starting treatment.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Guselkumab?** A: There's no specific interaction between Guselkumab and alcohol mentioned in current guidelines, but excessive alcohol consumption can negatively impact overall health.  It's best to discuss alcohol intake with your doctor.

* **Q: How should I store Guselkumab?** A: Store Guselkumab in the refrigerator.  Do not freeze.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on how to proceed if you miss a dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Guselkumab suddenly?** A:  No, do not stop taking Guselkumab without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly may cause your condition to worsen.
