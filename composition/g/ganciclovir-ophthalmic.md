# Ganciclovir (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Ganciclovir (Ophthalmic)

### Usage

Ganciclovir ophthalmic gel is primarily used to treat acute herpetic keratitis, commonly known as dendritic ulcers.  This condition is an infection of the cornea (the transparent front part of the eye) caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).  The gel helps to fight the viral infection and promote healing of the corneal ulcer.  It's specifically formulated for topical application to the eye.

### Dosage

**Herpetic Keratitis:**

* **Adults and Children â‰¥ 2 years:** The usual dosage is one (1) drop of 0.15% ganciclovir ophthalmic gel in the affected eye five times daily (approximately every 3 hours while awake) until the corneal ulcer heals.  This is then followed by one (1) drop three times a day (TID) for seven days.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, due to the low systemic absorption of the ophthalmic gel, dosage adjustments may not be necessary.  Always consult with a healthcare professional if you have concerns about kidney or liver function.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Blurred vision
* Eye irritation

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Punctate keratitis (small, superficial spots on the cornea)
* Conjunctival hyperemia (redness of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inside of the eyelid and covering the white part of the eye)


**Serious Side Effects:** While less common with topical application, systemic side effects associated with ganciclovir are possible with higher doses or prolonged use.  These can include bone marrow suppression and kidney problems.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual symptoms.

### How it Works

Ganciclovir is an antiviral medication. Once applied to the eye, it's converted into an active form that interferes with the herpes simplex virus's ability to replicate its DNA.  By inhibiting viral DNA replication, ganciclovir effectively reduces the viral load and promotes healing of the corneal ulcer.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling for topical ophthalmic use.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ganciclovir is categorized as pregnancy Category C. This means that the potential benefits may outweigh the risks in certain situations, but a healthcare provider should carefully weigh these factors. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised. Mothers with herpetic lesions near or on the breast should avoid breastfeeding.
* **Children:**  While used in children aged 2 years and older, close monitoring is necessary.
* **Contact Lenses:** Contact lenses should not be worn during treatment or if symptoms of herpetic keratitis are present.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible although less likely with topical application.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Stop using the medication and seek medical attention immediately if you experience any allergic reaction (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing).
