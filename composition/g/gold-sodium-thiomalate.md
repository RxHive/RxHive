# Gold Sodium Thiomalate
### Generic Name
Gold Sodium Thiomalate

### Usage

Gold sodium thiomalate is primarily used as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis in both adults and children (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis).  This means it's used alongside other treatments, not as a standalone medication. It's not a first-line treatment but is considered when other methods haven't provided sufficient relief.  Its use is reserved for specific cases of active rheumatoid arthritis where other treatments have proven insufficient.

### Dosage

**Adults (Rheumatoid Arthritis):** Gold sodium thiomalate is administered intramuscularly (IM).  A typical regimen starts with 10 mg in the first week, followed by 25 mg in the second week. The maintenance dose is usually 25-50 mg per week for up to 20 weeks or until toxicity is observed.  After this period, the dose is gradually reduced to 50 mg every 2-4 weeks until therapy is discontinued.


**Children (Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis):**  Intramuscular administration is also used in children. Treatment begins with 10 mg in the first week and then progresses to 1 mg/kg/week. The maintenance dose is 1 mg/kg every other week for 2-20 weeks, then gradually increasing the interval to every 3-4 weeks as tolerated. The maximum dose should not exceed 50 mg per injection.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Gold sodium thiomalate is contraindicated in patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  In cases of mild to moderate reactions, therapy may be temporarily interrupted, and cautiously resumed after the reaction subsides.  Severe reactions necessitate permanent discontinuation of treatment.  A test dose may be administered upon resuming therapy.

### How it Works

The exact mechanism of action for gold sodium thiomalate isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to either decrease prostaglandin synthesis (prostaglandins are involved in inflammation) or alter cellular mechanisms by inhibiting sulfhydryl systems. These actions contribute to its anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic effects.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Gold sodium thiomalate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to gold compounds or any component of the formulation; a history of severe toxicity to gold compounds or heavy metals; systemic lupus erythematosus; severe debilitation; blood dyscrasias (blood disorders); renal or hepatic impairment; a history of severe adverse effects from previous gold therapy (e.g., bone marrow aplasia, exfoliative dermatitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pulmonary fibrosis); significant dermatitis; and pregnancy or breastfeeding.

**Interactions:**  Concurrent use with ACE inhibitors may increase the risk of nitritoid reactions, requiring close monitoring.

**Warnings:**  Gold sodium thiomalate can cause serious and even fatal toxicities. Patients must be thoroughly informed about potential adverse reactions and encouraged to report any concerns promptly.  Close monitoring of blood counts, renal and liver function, and urinalysis is crucial throughout treatment.
