# Ginkgo Biloba

**Generic Name:** Ginkgo biloba

**Usage:**  Ginkgo biloba extract is primarily used to improve cognitive function, particularly memory and concentration. It's also sometimes used to treat symptoms of:

* **Dementia:**  May help improve cognitive function in individuals with mild to moderate dementia.  However, evidence is mixed and further research is needed.
* **Alzheimer's disease:** Similar to dementia, evidence is limited and inconclusive.
* **Peripheral artery disease (PAD):** May improve blood flow in the legs and reduce symptoms like pain and cramping during exercise.
* **Tinnitus (ringing in the ears):** Some studies suggest a potential benefit, but more research is needed.
* **Vertigo (dizziness):**  May offer some relief, but evidence is not definitive.
* **Sexual dysfunction:**  Some anecdotal evidence suggests it might improve erectile dysfunction, but scientific support is weak.


**Side Effects:** Ginkgo biloba is generally considered safe for most people when taken at recommended doses, but potential side effects can include:

* **Upset stomach:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort.
* **Headache:** A relatively common side effect.
* **Dizziness:** Can be exacerbated in individuals already prone to dizziness.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, hives.  This is more likely in individuals with allergies to plants in the same family (e.g., poison ivy).
* **Increased bleeding risk:** Ginkgo can interfere with blood clotting, increasing the risk of bleeding, especially when combined with blood thinners (anticoagulants) or aspirin.


**How it Works:** The exact mechanisms of action for Ginkgo biloba are not fully understood, but it's believed to work through several pathways:

* **Improved blood circulation:**  It may increase blood flow to the brain and other organs by improving blood vessel dilation and reducing platelet aggregation (clumping).
* **Antioxidant properties:**  Contains compounds that scavenge free radicals, protecting cells from damage.
* **Neuroprotective effects:**  May protect brain cells from damage caused by oxidative stress and inflammation.
