# Betaxolol (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Betaxolol (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Betaxolol ophthalmic solution or suspension is primarily used to lower elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.  These conditions can damage the optic nerve, leading to vision loss. Betaxolol helps manage IOP, thus slowing the progression of these diseases.  It's often used alone, but it may also be prescribed in combination with other glaucoma medications for more effective IOP control when necessary.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Elevated intraocular pressure (associated with chronic open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension):**
    * **0.25% Suspension:** Instill one drop into the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID).
    * **0.5% Solution:** Instill one to two drops into the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID).

**Children:**

* **Elevated intraocular pressure (associated with chronic open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension):**
    * **0.25% Suspension:** Instill one drop into the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID).  Dosage adjustments for children based on weight or age are not specifically detailed in standard prescribing information.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage for a child.


**Administration Guidelines:**  Wash hands before applying. Gently pull down the lower eyelid to create a pocket, then instill the drops. After administration, apply gentle pressure to the inner corner of the eye (near the nose) for about one minute to minimize systemic absorption. Avoid touching the dropper tip to the eye or any other surface to prevent contamination.  Remove contact lenses before application and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting. If using other eye drops, administer them at least 10 minutes before or after betaxolol.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  Short-term eye discomfort (burning, stinging), blurred vision.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are rare but require immediate medical attention:  choroidal detachment (separation of the choroid layer from the retina), corneal staining or damage, serious allergic reactions (including swelling of the face, throat, or tongue), decreased corneal sensitivity, eye pain, severe visual impairment.  Other less common side effects reported include bradycardia (slow heart rate), dizziness, headache, fatigue, and shortness of breath.


**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Betaxolol is a beta-blocker, specifically a cardioselective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist. This means it primarily affects beta-1 receptors in the heart, but has minimal impact on beta-2 receptors in the lungs. In the eye, betaxolol reduces the production of aqueous humor (the fluid that fills the space between the cornea and the lens). By decreasing aqueous humor production, it lowers IOP.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Betaxolol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to betaxolol or any component of the formulation; sinus bradycardia; uncompensated cardiac failure; cardiogenic shock; and heart block greater than first-degree (except in those with a functioning pacemaker).
* **Interactions:** Betaxolol can interact with numerous medications, including other beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, antihypertensive drugs, and cardiac glycosides.  These interactions can potentially worsen bradycardia, hypotension (low blood pressure), or other adverse effects. Always inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Use caution in patients with a history of severe anaphylaxis, bronchospastic disease (such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cardiovascular insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, compensated heart failure, myasthenia gravis, or peripheral vascular disease.  Beta-blockers can mask signs of hyperthyroidism, and may increase risk of anaphylactic reactions. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare provider before using betaxolol.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for betaxolol to work?** A:  The effect on IOP usually begins within an hour after instillation, with the maximal effect occurring in several hours.

* **Q: Can I stop using betaxolol suddenly?** A:  No, abruptly stopping betaxolol can cause a rapid increase in IOP.  Always consult your doctor before making changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: How should I store betaxolol?** A:  Store betaxolol at room temperature, away from direct light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember. However, if it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can betaxolol cause blurred vision?** A: Blurred vision is a common side effect, especially after instillation.  It usually subsides as your body adjusts to the medication.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until your vision clears.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of betaxolol?** A: Long-term use of betaxolol is generally safe and effective for managing IOP.  However, regular monitoring by your ophthalmologist is essential to assess its effectiveness and detect any potential side effects.
