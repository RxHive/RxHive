# Bromhexine + Salbutamol + Guaifenesin

**Generic Name:** Bromhexine + Salbutamol + Guaifenesin (This is a combination drug;  no single generic name exists for the combination.  Each ingredient has its own.)

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat symptoms of respiratory tract infections, particularly those involving bronchitis and coughs with phlegm.  It's often used for conditions where there is both bronchospasm (narrowing of the airways) and excessive mucus production.  The specific usage may vary depending on the formulation and doctor's prescription.

* **Bromhexine:**  A mucolytic agent that helps thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Salbutamol:** A bronchodilator that relaxes the muscles in the airways, opening them up to improve breathing.  It's a short-acting beta-2 agonist.
* **Guaifenesin:** An expectorant that helps to thin and loosen mucus, similar to bromhexine, but through a different mechanism.


**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects might include:

* **Bromhexine:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness. Rarely, allergic reactions like skin rash.
* **Salbutamol:** Tremors, nervousness, headache, palpitations, muscle cramps, increased heart rate. In rare cases, more serious cardiovascular effects.
* **Guaifenesin:** Nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, headache.


**How it Works:**

* **Bromhexine:** Reduces the viscosity (stickiness) of mucus by altering the chemical structure of the mucus glycoproteins.
* **Salbutamol:** Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle via beta-2 adrenergic receptor stimulation, leading to bronchodilation (widening of the airways).
* **Guaifenesin:** Increases the secretion of respiratory tract fluids, thereby thinning the mucus and facilitating its expectoration (coughing it up).
