# Bitolterol
### Generic Name
Bitolterol

### Usage
Bitolterol is a bronchodilator, meaning it helps to open up the airways in the lungs.  It was primarily used to treat reversible airway obstruction, a condition where the airways narrow and make breathing difficult. This includes conditions like asthma and, in some cases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's important to note that Bitolterol is no longer commercially available.

### Dosage
Because Bitolterol is no longer available, specific dosage information cannot be provided.  Dosage would have varied depending on the individual's age, weight, and the severity of their condition.  Different forms of the medication may have existed, such as inhalers or oral formulations, each with its own dosage guidelines.  It is crucial to consult medical records or historical pharmaceutical literature for any information related to past dosage recommendations.

### Side Effects
While Bitolterol is no longer available, common side effects associated with similar beta-2 agonists (such as tremor, headache, and palpitations) should be considered as potential side effects were the drug available. Less common, but more serious side effects, could have included paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of airway narrowing), and irregular heartbeat.  If any adverse effects occurred while Bitolterol was in use, immediate medical advice should have been sought.

### How it Works
Bitolterol is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into an active form in the body.  In this case, it's converted to colterol. Colterol is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist. This means it stimulates beta-2 receptors in the lungs.  Activating these receptors causes the muscles around the airways to relax, widening the airways and making it easier to breathe.

### Precautions
As Bitolterol is no longer on the market, detailed precautions based on current knowledge are unavailable. However, general precautions applicable to similar medications should be considered.  These could include avoiding use in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.  Interactions with other medications, particularly those affecting the heart or nervous system, should also have been considered. Special caution would have been necessary for pregnant or breastfeeding women and children, and potentially individuals with underlying cardiac or hyperthyroidism.
