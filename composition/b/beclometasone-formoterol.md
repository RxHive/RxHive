# Beclometasone + Formoterol

**Generic Name:** Beclometasone dipropionate/Formoterol fumarate

**Usage:**

Beclometasone dipropionate/Formoterol fumarate is a combination inhaler used to prevent and treat symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's a maintenance medication, meaning it's taken regularly to control symptoms, not just during an attack.  Beclometasone is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the airways, while formoterol is a long-acting beta2-agonist bronchodilator that relaxes and opens the airways.  This combination allows for better symptom control and reduced exacerbations (worsening of symptoms).  The specific dosage and frequency will be prescribed by a doctor based on individual needs and severity of the condition.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Throat irritation or hoarseness:** This is often mild and can be managed by rinsing the mouth after each use.
* **Headache:** Usually mild and resolves on its own.
* **Oral thrush (candidiasis):**  A fungal infection in the mouth. Rinsing the mouth after inhalation can help prevent this.
* **Cough:**  May occur, especially initially.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Increased risk of pneumonia:** Particularly in COPD patients.
* **Bone loss (osteoporosis):** Long-term use of corticosteroids can increase the risk.
* **Increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia):**  More common in individuals with diabetes.
* **Muscle weakness:**  Long-term use can potentially cause muscle weakness.
* **Paradoxical bronchospasm:**  A worsening of breathing symptoms after inhaling the medication (this is rare).
* **Skin reactions:**  Such as rashes or itching.


**How it Works:**

Beclometasone dipropionate reduces inflammation in the airways by suppressing the activity of immune cells that contribute to airway swelling and narrowing.  Formoterol fumarate relaxes the muscles around the airways, widening them and making it easier to breathe.  The combined effect provides both anti-inflammatory and bronchodilating actions, leading to improved lung function and symptom relief.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I use this medication during a severe asthma attack?** No. This is a preventative medication, not a rescue medication for acute attacks.  Use a short-acting beta2-agonist inhaler (like albuterol) for quick relief during an attack.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The bronchodilating effect of formoterol is usually felt quickly, while the anti-inflammatory effect of beclometasone takes longer to develop (days to weeks) for full benefit.
* **Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** No.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a worsening of symptoms.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Can I use this medication if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Discuss this with your doctor.  The benefits and risks of using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding need to be carefully considered.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  There is no specific interaction between alcohol and this medication, but excessive alcohol consumption can negatively affect overall health and could worsen underlying lung conditions.  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.
