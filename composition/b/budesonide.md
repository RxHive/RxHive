**Generic Name:** Budesonide

**Usage:**

Budesonide is a corticosteroid medication used to reduce inflammation in the body.  Its primary uses include:

* **Asthma:**  To prevent asthma attacks and reduce airway inflammation.  It's often used as a maintenance inhaler or in a combination inhaler with a bronchodilator.
* **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):** To reduce inflammation in the lungs and improve breathing in some patients with COPD.
* **Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever):**  Available as a nasal spray to reduce nasal inflammation, congestion, and sneezing.
* **Crohn's Disease:**  Used to reduce inflammation in the intestines.  Can be taken orally or rectally (as an enema or suppository).
* **Ulcerative Colitis:**  Similar to Crohn's disease, used to reduce intestinal inflammation.  Usually administered orally.
* **Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE):**  Used as a treatment for inflammation in the esophagus.

**Specific dosage and administration method vary greatly depending on the condition being treated and the formulation (inhaler, nasal spray, oral tablet, etc.). Always follow your doctor's instructions.**


**Side Effects:**

Side effects vary depending on the dosage, route of administration, and duration of treatment.  Common side effects include:

* **Inhaler:**  Hoarseness, thrush (oral yeast infection), cough, headache.
* **Nasal Spray:**  Nosebleeds, nasal irritation, headache.
* **Oral:**  Headache, nausea, vomiting, increased appetite, weight gain, increased risk of infections, mood changes, cataracts, glaucoma, osteoporosis (with long-term use).  These are more pronounced with higher doses and prolonged use.


**Serious side effects are rare but possible and include:**

* **Increased risk of infections:** Due to immunosuppression.
* **Cushing's syndrome:**  A group of symptoms caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of corticosteroids.
* **Adrenal insufficiency:** The adrenal glands produce less cortisol than the body needs.
* **Growth retardation:** In children.
* **Osteoporosis:**  Weakening of bones, leading to increased fracture risk.


**How it Works:**

Budesonide is a glucocorticoid (a type of corticosteroid). It works by binding to glucocorticoid receptors inside cells, which reduces the production of inflammatory substances, thus decreasing inflammation and swelling in the airways, intestines, or nasal passages.  This helps to open up airways, reduce swelling, and alleviate symptoms.
