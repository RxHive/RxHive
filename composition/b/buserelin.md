# Buserelin
### Generic Name
Buserelin

### Usage
Buserelin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist.  Its primary use is in the treatment of endometriosis in women who don't need immediate surgery.  It's also used as palliative treatment for hormone-dependent advanced prostate cancer (stage D).  In endometriosis, it works by suppressing the hormones that stimulate the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, thereby reducing pain and other symptoms. In prostate cancer, it reduces testosterone levels, slowing tumor growth.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition and route of administration.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Endometriosis (Intranasal):**  The typical dose is 400 mcg (200 mcg in each nostril) three times daily (TID). Treatment usually lasts 6 months, with a maximum duration of 9 months.

**Advanced Prostate Cancer:**  Dosage depends on the route of administration:

* **Subcutaneous (SubQ) Injection (initial phase):** 500 mcg every 8 hours for 7 days.
* **SubQ Injection (maintenance):** 200 mcg once daily (OD).
* **Subcutaneous Depot Implant:**  6.3 mg implant every 2 months, or 9.45 mg implant every 3 months.  The dosing interval may be adjusted slightly as needed.
* **Intranasal (maintenance):** 400 mcg (200 mcg in each nostril) TID.  Note that for prostate cancer, an antiandrogen is usually started about a week before buserelin and continued for up to 5 weeks concurrently.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of buserelin in children haven't been established.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Loss of libido
* Hot flashes
* Flatulence
* Nasal irritation (with intranasal administration)
* Back pain
* Weakness

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (1-10% of patients or less):**  These can include various symptoms affecting the nervous system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, skin, endocrine system, and genitourinary system.  Examples include dizziness, depression, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, gynecomastia, and changes in menstrual patterns.  Specific side effects can vary depending on the condition being treated and the route of administration.

**Serious Side Effects (rare but possible):**  Serious side effects are rare but can include allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), decreased bone mineral density, and potentially severe cardiovascular events.  Consult a healthcare professional immediately if you experience any serious or concerning side effects.


### How it Works

Buserelin is a synthetic version of GnRH.  Initially, it causes a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). However, with continued use, it leads to a long-term suppression of LH and FSH. This suppression reduces the production of sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone, which is the mechanism by which it treats endometriosis and prostate cancer.  The decrease in these hormones leads to the shrinking of endometrial tissue (endometriosis) and slows the growth of hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Buserelin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to buserelin or its components; non-hormone-dependent prostate cancer; those who have had an orchiectomy (surgical removal of the testicles); pregnant or breastfeeding women (for intranasal administration); and women with undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding.
* **Interactions:**  Buserelin can interact with several medications, including antidiabetic drugs, some radiopharmaceuticals and QTc-prolonging agents.  Discuss all medications you're taking with your doctor or pharmacist before starting buserelin.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Buserelin is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Effective non-hormonal contraception is essential during treatment.
* **Bone Density:**  Long-term use of GnRH agonists can potentially decrease bone mineral density.  Your doctor may monitor your bone health during treatment.
* **Other Precautions:** Use caution in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, genitourinary symptoms, or vertebral metastases.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the condition and individual response.  For endometriosis, symptom relief may take several weeks.  For prostate cancer, monitoring of tumor markers is needed to assess treatment effectiveness.

* **Q: Can I stop taking buserelin suddenly?** A:  No.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding stopping treatment.  Sudden cessation can lead to rebound effects.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  For non-depot formulations, take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store buserelin?** A: Store as directed on the product label.  Typically, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
