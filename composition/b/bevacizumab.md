# Bevacizumab
### Generic Name
Bevacizumab

### Usage

Bevacizumab is a targeted cancer therapy primarily used to block the growth of blood vessels that feed tumors. This process, known as angiogenesis inhibition, slows or stops the growth and spread of cancerous cells.  It's approved for various cancers, including:

* **Colorectal cancer:**  Used in first-line and later-line treatments of metastatic disease, often in combination with chemotherapy.
* **Lung cancer (non-squamous non-small cell):**  Used in first-line treatment of metastatic or locally advanced disease, typically alongside chemotherapy.  It may also be used for maintenance therapy after initial treatment.
* **Ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer:** Used in both first-line (with chemotherapy) and later-line treatment (platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive recurrent disease) of epithelial cancers.
* **Cervical cancer:** Employed in the treatment of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer.
* **Renal cell carcinoma:** Used in the treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer, often in combination with other therapies.
* **Glioblastoma:** Used in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma, sometimes alone or with other medications.
* **Hepatocellular carcinoma:** Used in combination with atezolizumab for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

While the above represent the FDA-approved uses, Bevacizumab is sometimes used off-label for other conditions, such as certain types of soft tissue sarcoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic macular edema.  However, its effectiveness and safety in these off-label uses haven't been extensively studied.  Always discuss off-label uses with your healthcare provider.

### Dosage

Bevacizumab dosage varies significantly depending on the specific cancer being treated, the treatment phase (first-line, second-line, etc.), and whether it's used alone or with other drugs.  Dosage is usually determined by a physician based on the patient's weight (mg/kg) and administered intravenously (IV).  The frequency of administration (every 2 weeks, every 3 weeks) also depends on the specific treatment plan.  Detailed dosage information is complex and varies widely.  It's crucial to consult the physician's prescription and accompanying instructions.

The information provided below is for illustrative purposes and should **not** be considered medical advice.  Never self-medicate with Bevacizumab.

* **Example (Illustrative Only):**  For metastatic colorectal cancer, a common dosage might be 5 mg/kg every two weeks, given intravenously in combination with chemotherapy.  However, this can vary.


### Side Effects

Bevacizumab can cause a range of side effects, varying in severity and frequency. Some common side effects include:

* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Nosebleeds
* Proteinuria (protein in urine)
* Hair thinning or loss

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Gastrointestinal perforation or fistula (hole or abnormal connection in the digestive tract)
* Bleeding (heavy or prolonged)
* Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism)
* Heart failure
* Kidney problems
* Neurological problems (such as headaches or vision changes)
* Impaired wound healing

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as more serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).  VEGF is a protein that stimulates the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), a process crucial for tumor growth and metastasis. By binding to VEGF, Bevacizumab blocks its activity, thus inhibiting angiogenesis and hindering tumor growth and spread.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Bevacizumab is categorized as a Pregnancy Category C drug, meaning potential harm to a fetus cannot be ruled out.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for several months afterward.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Breastfeeding is not recommended during Bevacizumab treatment.
* **Interactions with other drugs:** Bevacizumab can interact with several other medications.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Pre-existing conditions:** Patients with certain conditions, such as uncontrolled high blood pressure, history of heart failure, severe bleeding disorders, or recent major surgery, may be at increased risk of complications.  These should be discussed with the physician.
* **Surgery:** Bevacizumab should be withheld for at least 28 days before elective surgery and for at least 28 days after major surgery until wounds are adequately healed.
* **Allergic reactions:**  A hypersensitivity reaction to Bevacizumab is a contraindication to its use.

### FAQs

* **How is Bevacizumab administered?** It's typically administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional.
* **How long will I need to take Bevacizumab?** The duration of treatment varies greatly depending on the specific cancer, response to therapy, and the presence of side effects.  Your physician will determine the appropriate treatment duration.
* **How should I store Bevacizumab?** Bevacizumab is usually stored under refrigeration.  Follow the specific storage instructions provided with the medication.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss appropriate action.
* **Is Bevacizumab safe?** While generally safe, Bevacizumab carries the risk of significant side effects, as detailed above.  Your healthcare provider will carefully assess your suitability for the drug and monitor you for potential adverse events.
