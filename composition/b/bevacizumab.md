* **Colorectal cancer:**  Metastatic colorectal cancer, often in combination with chemotherapy (e.g., 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin).
* **Lung cancer:** Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), often in combination with chemotherapy.
* **Renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer):** Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, often in combination with interferon alfa or other targeted therapies.

* **Glioblastoma:**  A type of brain cancer, often in combination with other therapies.
* **Ovarian cancer:**  Metastatic ovarian cancer, often in combination with other chemotherapy regimens.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list, and the specific use of bevacizumab will be determined by a physician based on the individual patient's condition.


**Side Effects:**

Bevacizumab can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:** High blood pressure (hypertension), fatigue, nosebleeds, bleeding gums, diarrhea, abdominal pain, mouth sores, decreased appetite, protein in the urine (proteinuria), hand-foot syndrome (pain, swelling, redness of the hands and feet).
* **Serious side effects:**  Bleeding (including severe bleeding or gastrointestinal bleeding), blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), heart failure, kidney problems, slow wound healing, perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, increased risk of infections, and nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy).
* **Rare but serious side effects:**  A rare but serious complication is posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which can cause seizures, headaches, and vision problems.


**How it Works:**

Bevacizumab is a targeted therapy that works by binding to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).  VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).  Tumors rely on angiogenesis to grow and spread. By blocking VEGF, bevacizumab inhibits the formation of new blood vessels, thereby reducing the tumor's blood supply and hindering its growth and spread.
