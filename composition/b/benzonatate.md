# Benzonatate

**Generic Name:** Benzonatate

**Usage:**

Benzonatate is used to relieve coughs caused by the common cold, the flu, bronchitis, or other respiratory illnesses. It's a cough suppressant, meaning it works by reducing the urge to cough.  It's important to note that it's only used for coughs and does *not* treat the underlying illness causing the cough.  It's typically used for short-term cough relief.


**Side Effects:**

Benzonatate can cause several side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Some common side effects include:

* **Numbness or tingling:** This is a common side effect and is often felt in the mouth, throat, and/or other areas. This is because benzonatate has a numbing effect.
* **Drowsiness:**  Some individuals may experience drowsiness or dizziness.
* **Headache:**  Headaches can occur in some users.
* **Constipation:**  Less common, but constipation is a possible side effect.
* **Nausea:** Though less frequent than other side effects, nausea can occur.
* **Allergic reactions:**  In rare cases, allergic reactions can occur, including rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, or closing of the throat.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience an allergic reaction.

**How it Works:**

Benzonatate is a local anesthetic that works by numbing the nerve endings in the respiratory tract. This reduces the sensitivity of these nerves, lessening the urge to cough. It works by temporarily decreasing the signals sent to the brain which trigger a cough reflex.  It does not act on the brain directly like some other cough suppressants.
