# Benzonatate
### Generic Name
Benzonatate

### Usage
Benzonatate is an antitussive medication primarily used for the symptomatic relief of cough.  It's crucial to understand that it doesn't treat the underlying cause of the cough; it only reduces the cough reflex.  Therefore, it's most effective for managing coughs associated with various respiratory conditions, but not as a treatment for the conditions themselves.  It's commonly used to alleviate coughs resulting from the common cold, bronchitis, influenza, and other respiratory infections.  However, it is not suitable for all types of coughs.  Consult a physician to determine if benzonatate is the appropriate treatment for your cough.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The usual adult dosage is 100-200 mg three times daily (TID), as needed for cough. The maximum single dose is 200 mg, and the maximum daily dose is 600 mg.  Benzonatate is available in capsule form, and the capsules must be swallowed whole; do not crush, chew, or dissolve them.  Doing so can cause numbness in the mouth and throat, potentially leading to choking.

**Children:**  The use of benzonatate is generally not recommended for children under 10 years of age. For children over 10, the dosage is the same as for adults. However, always consult a pediatrician before giving any medication to a child.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor about appropriate dosage if you have impaired liver or kidney function.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of benzonatate may include:

*   Chest numbness or tingling
*   Dizziness
*   Headache
*   Sedation
*   Nausea
*   Constipation
*   Skin rash or itching

Less common, but serious side effects can include:

*   Hallucinations
*   Confusion
*   Chills
*   Hypersensitivity reactions (bronchospasm, laryngospasm, cardiovascular collapse) â€“ these are rare but require immediate medical attention.

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, discontinue use and seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works
Benzonatate is a local anesthetic that works by numbing the stretch receptors in the respiratory tract. These receptors trigger the cough reflex. By reducing the sensitivity of these receptors, benzonatate suppresses the cough reflex, providing relief from persistent coughing. It is structurally similar to tetracaine, another local anesthetic.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Benzonatate is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to benzonatate, related compounds, or any component of the formulation.

* **Drug Interactions:**  While specific interactions are not extensively documented, it's important to inform your doctor about all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking to avoid potential interactions.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Benzonatate is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning that its effects on a developing fetus are unknown.  It's crucial to discuss the use of benzonatate with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant. Excretion in breast milk is unknown, requiring caution in breastfeeding women.


* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with pre-existing respiratory conditions should use benzonatate with caution and under close medical supervision.  Older adults and individuals with impaired liver or kidney function should also use caution and consult their doctor before starting treatment.
