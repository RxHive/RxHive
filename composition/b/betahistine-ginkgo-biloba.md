# Betahistine + Ginkgo Biloba
### Generic Name
Betahistine + Ginkgo Biloba


**Note:**  Betahistine and Ginkgo Biloba are often combined in over-the-counter preparations, but it's crucial to understand that this is not a single generic medicine with a standardized composition like a drug approved by regulatory agencies. The specific ratio of Betahistine to Ginkgo Biloba can vary significantly between brands.  Always check the product label for the exact formulation. This information provides general guidance; consult your doctor or pharmacist for personalized advice based on the specific product you are using.


### Usage

This combination is primarily used to improve symptoms associated with **vertigo and Meniere's disease**.  Betahistine is a histamine H1 agonist, which means it affects the histamine system in the body and may help to reduce inner ear symptoms. Ginkgo Biloba is an herbal supplement thought to improve blood circulation, potentially aiding in reducing dizziness and related symptoms.  Together, they are believed to offer a synergistic effect, although scientific evidence supporting the combination's efficacy is limited compared to the established uses of each component individually.  It's important to note that this combination does not cure the underlying condition but aims to manage the symptoms.  Some preparations may also be used for tinnitus (ringing in the ears) though this is also less well-supported by research when Betahistine and Ginkgo Biloba are combined.


### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the specific brand and formulation.  There is no standardized dosage for this combination because it is not a regulated combination drug.  **Always follow the instructions on the product label precisely.**  Adult dosages typically involve taking one or two tablets or capsules daily as directed, but children should never take this medicine without consulting their pediatrician.  Oral administration is standard for both Betahistine and Ginkgo Biloba.  There are no IV formulations of this combination.  If you're unsure about the dosage, consult your pharmacist or doctor.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Nausea, headache, stomach upset, heartburn.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), changes in heart rate, increased bleeding risk (especially if taking blood thinners).
* **Ginkgo Biloba Specific:**  While generally considered safe at normal dosages, Ginkgo Biloba may increase the risk of bleeding.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, stop taking the medication and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Betahistine's mechanism is not fully understood but is believed to affect histamine receptors in the inner ear, potentially improving blood flow and reducing the symptoms of vertigo. Ginkgo Biloba's purported mechanism involves increasing blood flow and improving microcirculation, particularly in the brain, potentially addressing the circulatory component of dizziness and tinnitus.  The combination aims to work on both the inner ear mechanisms and blood flow to alleviate vertigo symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This combination should be avoided by individuals with known allergies to Betahistine or Ginkgo Biloba or any of their components. Individuals with severe heart or blood pressure problems should also consult a physician before using this combination. 
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ginkgo Biloba can interact with anticoagulants (blood thinners) and antiplatelet drugs, increasing the risk of bleeding.  It might also interact with some medications metabolized by the liver.  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your doctor before use if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of this combination, particularly bleeding risks associated with Ginkgo Biloba.  Careful monitoring is advised.
