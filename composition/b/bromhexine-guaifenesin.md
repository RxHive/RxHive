# Bromhexine + Guaifenesin
### Generic Name
Bromhexine + Guaifenesin

### Usage

Bromhexine + Guaifenesin is a combination medication used to treat productive coughs (coughs that produce mucus) associated with respiratory tract infections like bronchitis, pneumonia, and the common cold.  Bromhexine acts as an expectorant, helping to thin and loosen the mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up. Guaifenesin also works as an expectorant, assisting in the removal of phlegm from the airways.  Together, they aim to relieve congestion and make breathing easier. While primarily used for productive coughs, it may sometimes be prescribed to help manage symptoms associated with other respiratory conditions at a doctor's discretion.  It's crucial to understand that this medication treats the *symptoms* of a cough and underlying infection; it doesn't cure the infection itself.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (e.g., tablet, syrup), age, and the severity of the condition. Always follow the prescription instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  **Never self-medicate or alter the dosage without consulting a healthcare professional.**

* **Adults (Oral):**  Dosage typically ranges from one to two tablets or teaspoons of syrup several times daily, depending on the product and physician recommendation.  The exact frequency and duration of treatment will be determined by your doctor.

* **Children (Oral):**  Dosage for children is strictly based on weight and age.  Syrups are more common for children and are available in various strengths.  A doctor will calculate the appropriate dose.  This medication is generally not recommended for infants under a specific age.  Always follow the physician's dosage instructions precisely.

* **IV Administration:** Bromhexine + Guaifenesin is not typically administered intravenously (IV). This combination medication is almost always given orally.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Upset stomach
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness

Less common, but more serious side effects, requiring immediate medical attention, may include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Severe stomach pain
* Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine)


If you experience any adverse effects, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works

Bromhexine works by reducing the adhesiveness of mucus in the respiratory tract.  It helps to break down the bonds between mucus molecules, making the phlegm less viscous and easier to expel. Guaifenesin enhances the movement of mucus through the airways by increasing the fluid content of respiratory secretions.  By working together, these two expectorants facilitate the clearing of mucus from the lungs, ultimately relieving congestion and easing breathing.
