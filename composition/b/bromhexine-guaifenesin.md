# Bromhexine + Guaifenesin

**Generic Name:** Bromhexine + Guaifenesin

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat productive coughs (coughs that produce phlegm).  Bromhexine helps to loosen and thin the mucus, making it easier to cough up. Guaifenesin is an expectorant that helps to remove mucus from the airways.  It's typically used for coughs associated with the common cold, bronchitis, and other respiratory infections.  **It is crucial to consult a doctor before using this medication, especially for children or individuals with pre-existing health conditions.**  This medication is not a cure for the underlying infection, only a treatment for the cough symptom.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset
* **Central Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling (rare but serious)
* **Other:**  Changes in liver function (rare, requires monitoring), decreased blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia - rare)


**How it Works:**

* **Bromhexine:**  This is a mucolytic agent. It works by reducing the stickiness and viscosity of mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to expel. It achieves this by breaking down the bonds within the mucus.

* **Guaifenesin:** This is an expectorant. It thins and loosens the mucus in the airways, helping to clear congestion and making it easier to cough up. It increases the fluid content of the mucus, making it less viscous.
