# Benzyl Alcohol + Naftifine Hydrochloride
### Generic Name
Benzyl Alcohol + Naftifine Hydrochloride


### Usage

This combination of Benzyl Alcohol and Naftifine Hydrochloride is primarily used topically to treat fungal skin infections like athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), and ringworm (tinea corporis).  Benzyl alcohol acts as a preservative and antimicrobial agent, enhancing the efficacy of naftifine hydrochloride.  Naftifine hydrochloride is the active antifungal ingredient; it works by interfering with the growth and reproduction of the fungi causing these infections. While this combination is primarily used for superficial fungal infections, it's crucial to consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment as other skin conditions may mimic these infections.  The combination's effectiveness is specifically targeted at dermatophytes, a type of fungus responsible for the listed skin conditions.  It's not generally used for other types of fungal infections or bacterial skin infections.

### Dosage

**Dosage information provided here is for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.**  There is no standardized single dosage for this combination as it varies by product formulation and the specific concentration of each ingredient.  The dosage will be indicated on the packaging.

Generally, this combination is applied topically, typically once or twice daily to the affected area after cleaning and drying the skin.  The treatment duration depends on the severity of the infection and the individual's response, usually ranging from several weeks to a couple of months.  For children, adult supervision is critical during application. The product should not be used in the eyes or on mucous membranes.

Oral or intravenous administration of this combination is not typically practiced due to the topical nature of the application.  The active ingredient, Naftifine Hydrochloride, is available in oral formulations for systemic fungal infections, but this specific combination is not intended for such use.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Mild skin irritation (redness, burning, itching) at the application site.
* **Less Common:**  Dry skin, scaling, rash.
* **Serious (rare):** Allergic reactions (including rash, swelling, difficulty breathing).

**If any adverse effects occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.**


### How it Works

Naftifine hydrochloride, the main active ingredient, is an allylamine antifungal.  It inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.  By disrupting ergosterol production, naftifine hydrochloride damages the fungal cell membrane, leading to cell death and preventing fungal growth. Benzyl alcohol, acting as a preservative and antimicrobial agent, contributes to preventing bacterial or other microbial contamination of the formulation and helps maintain its efficacy. The combined action of both ingredients contributes to the effective treatment of superficial fungal infections.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This combination should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to naftifine hydrochloride or benzyl alcohol.
