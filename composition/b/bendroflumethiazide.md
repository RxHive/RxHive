# Bendroflumethiazide
### Generic Name
Bendroflumethiazide

### Usage
Bendroflumethiazide is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and edema (swelling caused by fluid retention).  Edema is often a symptom of heart failure.  The drug's action lowers blood pressure and reduces excess fluid in the body.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Hypertension:** The usual starting dose is 2.5-5 mg orally once daily, taken in the morning.  The dose may be adjusted as needed by a healthcare professional, but rarely exceeds 10mg per day.

* **Edema associated with heart failure:**  The initial dose is typically 5-10 mg orally once daily or on alternate days.  The maintenance dose may range from 2.5-10 mg, 2-3 times per week.  Dosage adjustments depend on individual response and must be determined by a physician.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

Bendroflumethiazide use in children is less common and requires careful medical supervision. Dosage is determined by the child's weight and the condition being treated.  Precise dosage recommendations are best obtained from a pediatrician or healthcare provider experienced in treating children with hypertension or edema.  Generally,  the maximum daily dose for children under 12 is 2.5mg/day, with dosage calculated based on weight in mg/kg/day.  Children 12 years and older may be prescribed adult dosages.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):**  Caution is advised;  use is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.  Consult your physician for advice on dosage.

* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):** Caution is advised; use is contraindicated in severe renal impairment.  Consult your physician for advice on dosage.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:** These may occur in a significant number of patients.

* Dizziness
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Gastric irritation


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention.

* Exfoliative dermatitis (severe skin reaction)
* Skin rash or photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, hypomagnesemia) â€“  low potassium, low sodium, high calcium, low magnesium levels in the blood.
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
*  Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia (blood disorders)
*  Pneumonitis (lung inflammation)
* Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the less common, serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Bendroflumethiazide is a thiazide diuretic. It works by increasing the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water from the body through the kidneys. This reduces fluid volume and blood pressure.  It achieves this by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium chloride in the kidneys. The precise mechanism by which it lowers blood pressure beyond this diuretic effect is not fully understood, but it's believed to involve effects on blood vessel tone.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Bendroflumethiazide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or thiazides, severe renal or hepatic insufficiency, hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, refractory hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, Addison's disease, and those with certain hereditary galactose intolerances.

* **Drug Interactions:**  This medication can interact with other drugs, including some commonly prescribed medications. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Certain interactions can increase the risk of side effects.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Bendroflumethiazide is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus exist.  It's generally avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

* **Specific Populations:** Older adults and individuals with underlying health conditions may require dosage adjustments or more frequent monitoring.

* **Alcohol:** Alcohol should be avoided or consumed only in moderation while taking Bendroflumethiazide, as it can increase the risk of dizziness and hypotension.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Bendroflumethiazide to work?**  A: The effects on blood pressure are typically seen within a few hours of taking the first dose, but the full therapeutic effect may take several weeks.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Bendroflumethiazide suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping this medication abruptly can cause a rebound effect, where your blood pressure increases significantly. Always consult your doctor before stopping or changing your dosage.

* **Q: How should I store Bendroflumethiazide?** A: Store this medication in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is close to the time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
