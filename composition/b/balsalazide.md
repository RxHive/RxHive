# Balsalazide
### Generic Name
Balsalazide

### Usage
Balsalazide is primarily used to treat mildly to moderately active inflammation of the colon, a condition known as ulcerative colitis.  It's an anti-inflammatory medication that works to reduce the inflammation and improve symptoms associated with this disease.  While not its primary indication, it's sometimes used off-label for maintenance therapy in ulcerative colitis, helping to prevent relapses after achieving remission.


### Dosage

**Adults:**  Dosage varies depending on the treatment goal (induction of remission or maintenance) and the formulation used (capsules or tablets).

* **Remission Induction (Ulcerative Colitis):**  The typical starting dose is 2.25 grams (three 750 mg capsules) three times daily for up to 8-12 weeks.  Alternatively, 3.3 grams (three 1.1 g tablets) twice daily for up to 8 weeks may be used (Note: efficacy of tablets has not been demonstrated in females).

* **Maintenance Therapy (Ulcerative Colitis - Off-Label):** Dosages range from 1.5 to 3 grams twice daily for 6-12 months.  This is not a standard, FDA-approved use and should be discussed with a physician.


**Children (aged ≥5 years and adolescents ≤17 years):**  The dosage for children is tailored to their individual needs and is determined by their weight and response to treatment.  It generally ranges from 2.25 g/day (750 mg three times daily) to 6.75 g/day (2.25 g three times daily), for up to 8 weeks.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised, and a physician should carefully assess the risks and benefits before prescribing balsalazide in these cases.


**Administration:** Balsalazide capsules should be swallowed whole.  If swallowing capsules is difficult, the contents can be sprinkled onto approximately 10 ml of applesauce, mixed well, and swallowed immediately. Do not store the mixture.  Note that opening and sprinkling the capsule may stain the teeth and tongue.

### How it Works

Balsalazide is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid or 5-ASA), in the body. Mesalamine works locally in the colon to reduce inflammation.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to involve interfering with the production of substances that contribute to inflammation in the gut.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Balsalazide is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to balsalazide, salicylates, aminosalicylates, or any of the formulation's components.

* **Interactions:** Balsalazide may interact with other medications, particularly azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (increased risk of blood disorders), NSAIDs (increased nephrotoxicity), and cardiac glycosides (decreased serum concentration). Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor before starting balsalazide.

* **Warnings:**  Use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, hepatic or renal impairment, or pyloric stenosis.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Balsalazide is categorized as a Pregnancy Category B drug.  While the risk to the fetus is considered low based on animal studies, it's crucial to discuss the potential benefits and risks with your doctor.  The excretion of balsalazide in breast milk is unknown, but mesalamine (its active metabolite) is excreted; weigh the benefits against potential risks before using it during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take balsalazide with food?** A: Balsalazide can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store balsalazide?** A: Store balsalazide at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking balsalazide abruptly?** A: No, it’s important to follow your doctor's instructions regarding stopping balsalazide to avoid potential issues.

* **Q: Does balsalazide cause drowsiness?** A: While drowsiness is not a common side effect, some patients report fatigue or insomnia.  If you experience this, consult your physician.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with balsalazide use?** A: Long-term use is possible for maintenance therapy, but regular monitoring is needed to check for any potential side effects, especially kidney or liver problems. Discuss long-term effects with your physician.
