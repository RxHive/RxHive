# Balsalazide

**Generic Name:** Balsalazide

**Usage:**

Balsalazide is used to treat mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  It's specifically indicated for maintaining remission in patients who have responded to initial treatment. It is *not* generally used for treating Crohn's disease.  It works locally in the colon and is not typically used for systemic inflammation.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of balsalazide include:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Flatulence (gas)
* Vomiting


Less common, but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Severe abdominal pain
* Rectal bleeding
* Worsening of colitis symptoms
* Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)


This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult the medication's package insert or your doctor for complete information.


**How it Works:**

Balsalazide is a prodrug. This means it's inactive until it's metabolized in the colon.  Once in the colon, it's converted into 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), an anti-inflammatory drug.  The 5-ASA reduces inflammation in the colon's lining, helping to alleviate the symptoms of ulcerative colitis. The exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators in the gut.


**FAQs:**

* **Is balsalazide a steroid?** No, balsalazide is not a steroid.  It's a 5-ASA derivative.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking balsalazide?**  While there's no direct interaction listed, alcohol can irritate the digestive system, potentially worsening symptoms of ulcerative colitis.  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **How long does it take to work?**  The time it takes for balsalazide to work varies depending on the individual.  Improvement in symptoms may be noticed within a few weeks, but it may take longer to see full benefit.

* **Can I take balsalazide with other medications?**  You should always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as there may be interactions.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Can I stop taking balsalazide suddenly?**  No, you should not stop taking balsalazide suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly could lead to a flare-up of your ulcerative colitis.
