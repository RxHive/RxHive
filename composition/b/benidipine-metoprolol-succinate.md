# Benidipine + Metoprolol Succinate

**Generic Name:** Benidipine + Metoprolol Succinate

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  Benidipine is a calcium channel blocker, and metoprolol succinate is a beta-blocker.  By combining these two drugs, they work synergistically to lower blood pressure more effectively than either drug alone in some patients.  It is typically prescribed when lifestyle changes (diet, exercise) and monotherapy (using just one of the drugs) have proven insufficient in controlling blood pressure.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a physician based on individual needs and response.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include but are not limited to:

* **Common:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, fatigue, nausea, slow heart rate (bradycardia), swelling in ankles and feet (edema), constipation.
* **Less Common:**  Shortness of breath, depression, insomnia, weakness, impotence, cold extremities.
* **Serious (require immediate medical attention):**  Severe dizziness or fainting, irregular heartbeat, worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), severe liver problems (jaundice, dark urine, pale stools), significant changes in heart rate or rhythm.  This list is not exhaustive, and other side effects may occur.

**How it Works:**

* **Benidipine (Calcium Channel Blocker):**  Relaxes blood vessels by blocking the entry of calcium into the smooth muscle cells of the arteries.  This dilation of blood vessels reduces the resistance to blood flow, leading to lower blood pressure.
* **Metoprolol Succinate (Beta-blocker):**  Reduces the heart's workload by slowing down the heart rate and decreasing the force of contractions.  This also contributes to lower blood pressure.  It also can help block the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart and blood vessels.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  A:  Alcohol can lower blood pressure and may increase the risk of side effects, especially dizziness and lightheadedness.  It's best to limit or avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.  Consult your doctor.

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No, stopping abruptly can be dangerous and may lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure or other adverse effects.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: What are the potential drug interactions?** A: Many medications can interact with benidipine and metoprolol succinate.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  This includes over-the-counter drugs.

* **Q:  Are there any precautions I should take?** A:  This medication should be used with caution in patients with certain conditions such as asthma, heart block, heart failure, liver or kidney disease, and peripheral artery disease.  Regular monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is essential.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding considerations are important; consult your doctor.
