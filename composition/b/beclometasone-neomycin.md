# Beclometasone + Neomycin
### Generic Name
Beclometasone + Neomycin

### Usage
Beclometasone dipropionate and neomycin sulfate combination is a topical medication primarily used to treat inflammatory skin conditions complicated by bacterial infections.  Beclometasone, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation and itching. Neomycin, an antibiotic, combats bacterial growth.  This combination is frequently prescribed for conditions like eczema (atopic dermatitis) or psoriasis when a bacterial secondary infection is present or suspected.  It's crucial to understand that this medication treats the symptoms and doesn't address the underlying cause of the skin condition. It's not suitable for all forms of eczema or psoriasis, and its use should be guided by a healthcare professional.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation (cream, ointment, lotion), the affected area's size, and the severity of the condition.  There's no standardized dosage across all products.  A doctor will determine the appropriate amount and frequency of application.  Generally, a thin layer is applied to the affected area a few times daily, as directed.  **This medication is for external use only and should not be ingested.**  There are no standard pediatric or adult IV formulations of Beclometasone + Neomycin, as it's solely a topical treatment.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Burning or stinging sensation at the application site, skin dryness, skin thinning, skin irritation, itching.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Skin infections (fungal or viral), allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling), changes in skin pigmentation, striae (stretch marks), acne, increased hair growth (hirsutism).  Prolonged or excessive use can lead to systemic absorption of corticosteroids, causing more widespread side effects.
* **Note:** If any unusual symptoms occur, or if the condition worsens, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Beclometasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation by suppressing the activity of inflammatory cells in the skin. This lessens swelling, redness, itching, and discomfort associated with the skin condition. Neomycin sulfate is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, effectively killing or inhibiting the growth of susceptible bacteria that often complicate skin conditions. The combination provides both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects, targeting both the inflammation and the infection simultaneously.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used on individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to beclometasone, neomycin, or any other components of the formulation.  It shouldn't be used for treating viral infections like chickenpox or herpes simplex.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While less common with topical application, potential interactions with other medications exist.  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, you are currently using.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be approached cautiously and only under the guidance of a physician. The potential risks and benefits should be carefully considered.
* **Children:**  Use in children requires careful monitoring by a physician due to potential increased risk of side effects.
* **Elderly:**  Elderly individuals may be more susceptible to skin thinning and other side effects.  Careful monitoring is crucial.
* **Avoid:**  Avoid contact with eyes, mouth, and open wounds.  Do not use on large areas of the body or for prolonged periods without medical supervision.
