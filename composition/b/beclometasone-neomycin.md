# Beclometasone + Neomycin

**Generic Name:** Beclometasone dipropionate + Neomycin sulfate

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical treatment primarily used for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions, particularly those complicated by bacterial infection.  Specific indications may vary depending on the formulation (cream, ointment, etc.) and local prescribing guidelines, but it's commonly used for conditions such as:

* Eczema (atopic dermatitis) with secondary infection
* Psoriasis with secondary infection
* Dermatitis with secondary infection

**Important Note:** This is not a first-line treatment for most skin conditions. It should only be used when a bacterial infection is suspected *in addition* to the inflammatory process.  A doctor should always diagnose and prescribe this medication.  Using it inappropriately can lead to complications like antibiotic resistance.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the formulation but can include:

* **Local effects:** Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, skin irritation, redness, folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles), skin thinning, striae (stretch marks), perioral dermatitis (rash around the mouth), hypopigmentation (loss of skin color).
* **Systemic effects (less common but possible, especially with prolonged or widespread use):**  These are more likely with high-potency corticosteroids like beclomethasone.  Systemic effects can include adrenal suppression (particularly in children and with large surface area application), increased blood glucose, cataracts, glaucoma, and others.  Neomycin can cause allergic reactions or sensitivity.

**How it Works:**

* **Beclometasone dipropionate:** This is a corticosteroid (a type of steroid). It works by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune response in the skin, thereby reducing redness, swelling, and itching.
* **Neomycin sulfate:** This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It works by killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria, addressing the secondary infection component of the skin condition.  The combination allows for simultaneous management of both the inflammatory and infectious aspects.
