# Benazepril
### Generic Name
Benazepril

### Usage
Benazepril is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It's an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, a type of medication that helps relax blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood.  This lowers blood pressure.

While its primary use is for hypertension, benazepril also has some off-label uses, meaning it's used for conditions not officially approved by regulatory agencies. These include treating heart failure, diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease related to diabetes), non-diabetic kidney disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy (thickening of the heart muscle).  It's important to note that these off-label uses should only be considered under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The dosage of benazepril varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's individual response.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Hypertension:**  The starting dose is typically 10 mg once daily. This may be reduced to 5 mg if the patient is already taking a diuretic.  The dose can be increased to 20-40 mg once or twice daily, up to a maximum of 80 mg daily.

* **Heart Failure (off-label):** Treatment usually begins with a very low dose of 2.5mg once daily and is increased gradually, as tolerated, over several days or weeks, reaching a maximum of 20mg daily.  Close monitoring is crucial due to the risk of hypotension (low blood pressure).

* **Diabetic/Non-diabetic Nephropathy (off-label):**  A typical starting dose is 10 mg once daily.


* **Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (off-label):**  Often combined with other medications.  A common regimen might include 20 mg of benazepril with 5 mg of amlodipine once daily.


**Pediatric Dosage:** Benazepril is used in children aged 6 years and older with hypertension. The starting dose is usually calculated based on the child's weight (0.2 mg/kg once daily), with a maximum initial dose of 10 mg. The dose can be adjusted as needed, with a maximum dose of 40 mg daily or 0.6 mg/kg/day.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary for patients with kidney or liver problems.  For those with reduced kidney function, the starting dose is usually lower, and the maximum dose might be lower as well. Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance on dosage adjustments based on individual health conditions.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Orthostatic dizziness (dizziness upon standing)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**  These require immediate medical attention:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Severe allergic reactions
* Persistent cough
* Changes in kidney function
* Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes)
* Significant changes in blood counts.

If you experience any side effects, especially those listed above, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Benazepril is an ACE inhibitor.  ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) is a substance in the body that helps raise blood pressure.  Benazepril blocks the action of ACE, leading to a reduction in angiotensin II, a hormone that constricts blood vessels. By reducing the levels of angiotensin II, blood vessels relax, and blood pressure decreases.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Benazepril should not be used by people allergic to ACE inhibitors or with a history of angioedema. It's also contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  It should be used cautiously, or avoided altogether, in certain conditions such as renal artery stenosis, severe aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

* **Drug Interactions:** Benazepril can interact with many other drugs.  It's especially important to mention all medications (including over-the-counter and herbal remedies) you are taking to your doctor or pharmacist.  Some examples of potential interactions include other blood pressure medications, potassium supplements, and NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

* **Specific Warnings:**  Special care is needed in individuals with kidney or liver disease, older adults, and patients with diabetes.  Close monitoring of blood pressure and kidney function may be necessary.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take benazepril with food?** A: Benazepril can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store benazepril?** A: Store benazepril at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.

* **Q: Can I stop taking benazepril suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping benazepril suddenly can be harmful. Always talk to your doctor before making changes to your medication.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed previously.
