# Bromhexine + Cetirizine + Diethylcarbamazine
### Generic Name
Bromhexine + Cetirizine + Diethylcarbamazine


**Please Note:**  A combination drug containing Bromhexine, Cetirizine, and Diethylcarbamazine is not a standard or widely recognized formulation.  While each of these medications is used individually for specific conditions, their combined use is not typically prescribed. This information is provided for educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for using this particular combination.  **Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication, especially a combination not explicitly approved.**  Using medications improperly can be harmful.

The following information describes the individual components and their typical uses. It does *not* describe the effects or safety of a hypothetical combination.

### Usage

* **Bromhexine:** This is an expectorant, meaning it helps to thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up. It's primarily used to treat productive coughs associated with respiratory tract infections like bronchitis or pneumonia.

* **Cetirizine:** This is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies, such as sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and hives. It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.

* **Diethylcarbamazine:** This is an antiparasitic drug used to treat filariasis, a disease caused by parasitic worms that infect the lymphatic system.  It works by killing the worms and reducing the inflammation they cause.


### Dosage

Dosage information for each drug is provided separately, as a combined dosage regimen would need to be determined by a physician and would depend heavily on the specific indication for the combined use (which is generally not standard practice).  **Never attempt to combine dosages yourself.**


* **Bromhexine:** Dosage varies depending on the formulation (tablet, syrup) and the patient's age and condition.  Always follow the prescription instructions precisely.

* **Cetirizine:** Dosage varies depending on the formulation and patient's age.  Common adult dosages are 5-10mg once or twice daily.  Pediatric dosages are significantly lower and determined by weight and age. Always follow the prescription instructions.

* **Diethylcarbamazine:** Dosage is determined by the doctor based on the type and severity of the parasitic infection.


### Side Effects

**Bromhexine:**  Common side effects may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach upset. Less common but more serious side effects may include allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).

**Cetirizine:** Common side effects may include drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, and fatigue.  Less common side effects may include dizziness, nausea, and upset stomach.

**Diethylcarbamazine:** Side effects can vary based on dosage and the patient's individual response. They might include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fever, and allergic reactions. In some cases, particularly with high doses, more serious side effects can occur.


### How it Works


* **Bromhexine:** It increases the secretion of fluids in the respiratory tract, reducing the viscosity of mucus, which helps expel it from the lungs.

* **Cetirizine:** It competitively blocks histamine from binding to its receptors, preventing the allergic response.

* **Diethylcarbamazine:**  It interferes with the metabolism of filarial worms, leading to their death and reduction of inflammation.


### Precautions

* **Bromhexine:** Should be used cautiously in patients with a history of peptic ulcers or stomach problems.

* **Cetirizine:** Should be used cautiously in patients with glaucoma, urinary retention, or a history of seizures.  Drowsiness is a possible side effect, impacting driving or operating machinery.

* **Diethylcarbamazine:**  Requires careful monitoring for potential side effects.  It's particularly important to be cautious in patients with pre-existing heart, liver, or kidney conditions.
