# Brimonidine (Topical)
### Generic Name
Brimonidine (Topical)

### Usage
Brimonidine topical is used to treat persistent (not temporary) redness of the face associated with rosacea in adults 18 years and older.  It's specifically targeted at reducing the visible redness, not other symptoms of rosacea like bumps or pimples.  This medication is applied directly to the skin of the face.

### Dosage
**Rosacea-associated persistent facial erythema (redness):**

* **Adult:**  The usual dose is a pea-sized amount of 0.33% brimonidine gel applied once daily (OD) as a thin layer to the entire face, covering the forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin.  Avoid contact with the eyes and lips. Wash hands thoroughly after application.

* **Pediatric:** Brimonidine topical is not recommended for use in children under 2 years old, as safety and effectiveness have not been established in this age group.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult with a healthcare professional if you have concerns about your liver or kidney function.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Burning sensation on the skin
* Localized warmth
* Tingling or numbness (paresthesia)
* Flushing
* Redness (erythema)
* Acne
* Allergic or other skin reactions (contact dermatitis, etc.)
* Skin pain
* Blurred vision
* Nasal congestion


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Angioedema (swelling under the skin)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Dizziness
* Hypotension (low blood pressure), including orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing)
* Pallor (unusually pale skin)
* Pharyngeal edema (swelling in the throat)
* Swelling of the lips or tongue
* Urticaria (hives)

**Note:** If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Brimonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist.  When applied topically, it works by narrowing the blood vessels in the skin (vasoconstriction), which reduces the visible redness associated with rosacea.  The effect is localized to the area of application.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Brimonidine topical is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to brimonidine or any components of the formulation, and in neonates and infants under 2 years of age.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients with orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), severe or unstable cardiovascular disease, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, scleroderma, thromboangiitis obliterans, Raynaud's phenomenon, depression, or SjÃ¶gren's syndrome may have an increased risk of experiencing adverse effects.
* **Drug Interactions:** Brimonidine topical may increase the effects of blood pressure-lowering medications, central nervous system depressants, and digoxin.  Its effects may be increased by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Brimonidine topical is categorized as a Pregnancy Category B drug, meaning animal studies have not shown risk, but human studies are lacking.  It is unknown whether brimonidine passes into breast milk. A healthcare professional should be consulted before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
