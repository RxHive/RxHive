# Bosentan

**Generic Name:** Bosentan

**Usage:**

Bosentan is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary hypertension associated with scleroderma.  It helps to improve exercise capacity and delay disease progression in patients with these conditions.  It's specifically indicated for patients with PAH classified as WHO Functional Class II or III.

**Side Effects:**

Bosentan can cause a range of side effects, some common and some rare.  The most common side effects include:

* **Headache:** This is a frequently reported side effect.
* **Flushing:**  A feeling of warmth or redness in the face, neck, and upper body.
* **Leg edema (swelling):** Fluid retention in the legs and ankles.
* **Nasopharyngitis (common cold):** Upper respiratory tract infection.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Liver injury:**  Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT) are a potential serious side effect requiring liver function monitoring.  Bosentan should be discontinued if significant liver damage occurs.
* **Anemia:** Low red blood cell count.
* **Fluid retention:**  Can lead to edema (swelling) in various parts of the body.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  Especially when initiating therapy or increasing the dose.


**How it Works:**

Bosentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist.  Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor (a substance that narrows blood vessels), and its overproduction contributes to the increased blood pressure in PAH. Bosentan works by blocking the actions of endothelin-1 at its receptors (ETA and ETB), leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and improved blood flow in the lungs. This helps to reduce the strain on the heart and improve exercise capacity.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How often do I need to take Bosentan?**  A:  The usual dose is twice daily.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.
* **Q:  What blood tests are needed while taking Bosentan?** A: Regular monitoring of liver function (AST, ALT) and complete blood count (CBC) is essential to detect potential side effects.
* **Q:  Can I take Bosentan with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible.  Some medications may be contraindicated with Bosentan.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking Bosentan?** A:  It's advisable to limit or avoid alcohol consumption, as it can potentially worsen some side effects or interact with the medication.
* **Q:  Can Bosentan be taken during pregnancy?** A:  Bosentan is **contraindicated** during pregnancy because it can cause serious harm to the developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age must use effective contraception while taking this medication.
* **Q:  What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe headache, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), dark urine, unusual bruising or bleeding, or significant swelling.
