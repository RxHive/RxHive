# Borax
### Generic Name
Borax (Sodium Borate)

### Usage
Borax, chemically known as sodium borate or sodium tetraborate, is primarily used as an antiseptic and antifungal agent, though its internal use is strongly discouraged due to toxicity concerns.  Historically, it was used in low concentrations as a mild astringent in some topical creams and as a component in throat lozenges (though this practice is now obsolete due to safety concerns).  Currently, its main applications are external, primarily in:

* **Cosmetics:** Borax acts as a preservative and buffer in various cosmetic products like shampoos, soaps, and makeup to help prevent bacterial and fungal growth.  It's a relatively inexpensive and effective option for this purpose.
* **Cleaning Products:**  Borax is a component in certain cleaning agents due to its mild abrasive and antimicrobial properties.

**Important Note:** Borax should never be ingested or inhaled.  Its internal use is considered dangerous and can cause severe health problems.

### Dosage
Because of its toxicity, there are no standard internal dosage recommendations for borax.  External use in cosmetics and cleaning products varies widely based on the specific product formulation and should strictly adhere to the manufacturer's instructions. There should be no self-medication with Borax.  Any use beyond strictly adhering to product label directions should be avoided.  Consult a healthcare professional before using borax for any purpose.

### Side Effects
Even in external applications, borax can cause adverse reactions, especially with prolonged or excessive exposure:

* **Skin irritation:**  Redness, itching, rash, and dryness are common.  The high alkalinity of borax contributes to this irritation.
* **Eye irritation:**  Contact with the eyes can cause burning, redness, and potential damage.
* **Respiratory irritation:**  Inhalation of borax dust can irritate the respiratory system.

**Serious side effects (from ingestion or significant exposure):**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, organ damage, and potentially death are severe risks associated with ingestion or high-level exposure.  Seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms occur.

### How it Works
Borax's antimicrobial effects are primarily attributed to its ability to disrupt the cell membranes of bacteria and fungi.  It works through a combination of mechanisms, including disrupting cellular processes and enzymatic activity crucial for their survival and reproduction.  The exact mechanisms are complex and vary based on the concentration and the specific microorganism.  Again, it should be clearly stated that these effects are observed *only* in external applications in extremely low concentrations.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Borax should be avoided entirely for internal use. Even external use should be approached with caution, particularly on sensitive skin.  Individuals with known allergies to borax or other boron compounds should avoid all contact.

**Drug Interactions:**  While not as well studied as for internally used medications, potential interactions are possible.  If using borax-containing products, inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications, supplements, and topical treatments you are using.

**Warnings:**

* **Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women:** Avoid any form of borax exposure, especially internal, due to potential risks to the fetus or infant.
* **Children:** Keep borax products out of reach of children. Accidental ingestion can be extremely dangerous.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may have more sensitive skin and are at increased risk of adverse reactions.
* **People with Existing Skin Conditions:** Individuals with eczema, psoriasis, or other skin sensitivities should exercise extreme caution and consult a healthcare professional before using borax-containing products.
