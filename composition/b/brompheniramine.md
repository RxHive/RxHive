# Brompheniramine
### Generic Name
Brompheniramine

### Usage

Brompheniramine is an antihistamine primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergies and the common cold.  Its main applications include:

* **Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever):** This is the most common use, targeting symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes and nose, and nasal congestion caused by seasonal or perennial allergens (pollen, dust mites, pet dander, etc.).
* **Urticaria (Hives):**  Brompheniramine helps alleviate itching and swelling associated with hives.
* **Common Cold Symptoms:** While it doesn't cure the cold, it can reduce some symptoms like runny nose and sneezing.
* **Allergic Reactions:** In some cases, it may be used to manage mild allergic reactions, but more potent medications are often needed for severe reactions.
* **Vasomotor Rhinitis:** This less common condition involves similar symptoms to allergic rhinitis but without a clear allergic trigger. Brompheniramine can provide symptom relief in these cases.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the patient's age, weight, condition, and the specific formulation (immediate-release or extended-release).  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions.  The information below is for general knowledge and should not replace professional medical advice.


**Adults:**

* **Oral (Immediate-Release):** 4-8 mg every 6 hours as needed, up to a maximum of 24 mg per day.
* **Oral (Extended-Release):** 6-12 mg twice daily (BID).
* **Parenteral (IM, IV, SubQ):** 5-20 mg every 6-12 hours, up to a maximum of 40 mg per day.  This route is typically used in more severe situations and requires administration by a healthcare professional.


**Children:** Dosage for children is significantly lower and strictly dependent on age and weight.  **Never administer adult doses to children.**  Consult a pediatrician or pharmacist for appropriate pediatric dosages.  They will consider your child's age, weight, and the specific symptoms being treated to determine a safe and effective dose.  Pediatric formulations, often in liquid syrup form, are available for easier administration.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are usually mild and may include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Upset stomach

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) - symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, hives.
* Fast heartbeat (tachycardia)
* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias)
* Seizures
* Confusion
* Hallucinations

If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking brompheniramine and consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Brompheniramine is an antihistamine that works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body in response to allergens or during an allergic reaction. Histamine causes many of the symptoms of allergies and the common cold, such as itching, sneezing, runny nose, and swelling. By blocking histamine, brompheniramine helps alleviate these symptoms.  It also exhibits anticholinergic and sedative effects, contributing to its symptom-relieving properties.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:** Brompheniramine should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to it or related medications.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Brompheniramine can interact with other medications, including sedatives, antidepressants, and certain antibiotics.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking.  Concurrent use with MAO inhibitors is contraindicated.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of brompheniramine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Specific Populations:**  Caution is advised when using brompheniramine in elderly individuals, patients with cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, liver or kidney disease, or those with underlying respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic bronchitis.  Children may experience excitation rather than sedation.
