# Bosutinib

**Generic Name:** Bosutinib

**Usage:**  Bosutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used to treat Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in adult patients who have failed prior treatment with at least two tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib.  It may also be used in patients who are intolerant to prior TKIs.  Note that the specific usage may be determined by a physician based on patient-specific factors.

**Side Effects:**  Bosutinib can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and some serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation
* **Skin:** Rash, pruritus (itching)
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling tired or weak
* **Headache**
* **Elevated Liver Enzymes:**  This requires monitoring with blood tests.
* **Fluid Retention (Edema):** Swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet.


Serious side effects, although less common, can include:

* **Severe Liver Damage (Hepatotoxicity):**  Requires immediate medical attention.
* **Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD):**  Inflammation and scarring of the lungs, potentially fatal.  Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough.
* **Bleeding:** Increased risk of bleeding due to effects on platelets.
* **Cardiovascular Events:** Including heart failure.
* **Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS):**  A potentially life-threatening condition that can occur when cancer cells are rapidly destroyed.


This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary significantly between individuals.  Always consult a doctor if you experience any concerning side effects.

**How it Works:** Bosutinib works by inhibiting the activity of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase enzyme. This enzyme is abnormally active in Ph+ CML and is responsible for the uncontrolled growth of leukemia cells. By blocking this enzyme, bosutinib helps to slow or stop the growth of these cells.  It targets specific mutations that other TKIs might not effectively address, making it useful in resistant cases.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is Bosutinib a first-line treatment for CML?**  A: No, Bosutinib is typically reserved for patients who have not responded to or are intolerant of other TKIs, usually imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib.  It's a later-line treatment option.

* **Q: How often do I need to take Bosutinib?** A:  The dosage and frequency will be determined by your physician based on your individual needs and response to the medication.

* **Q: What are the monitoring requirements while taking Bosutinib?** A:  Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor your blood counts, liver function, and other important parameters to detect and manage potential side effects.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of Bosutinib?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for advice on how to proceed.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions with Bosutinib?** A: Yes, there are potential interactions.  It is crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting Bosutinib.
