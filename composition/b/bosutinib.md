# Bosutinib
### Generic Name
Bosutinib

### Usage
Bosutinib is a medication primarily used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a type of blood cancer.  It's specifically indicated for adult patients in several situations:

* **Newly diagnosed chronic-phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML:** This is its main use, targeting the disease early in its progression.
* **Chronic, accelerated, or blast-phase Ph+ CML resistant or intolerant to prior therapy:** Bosutinib is an option for patients whose CML has not responded well to, or who cannot tolerate, other treatments.  The accelerated and blast phases represent more advanced stages of the disease.

### Dosage

Bosutinib is administered orally (as a tablet). Dosage varies depending on the patient's condition and response to treatment:

**Adults:**

* **Newly diagnosed chronic-phase Ph+ CML:** The starting dose is typically 400 mg once daily. This continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.  The physician may consider increasing the dose in increments of 100mg up to a maximum of 600mg daily if needed and tolerated.

* **Chronic, accelerated, or blast-phase Ph+ CML (resistant or intolerant to prior therapy):**  The starting dose is generally 500 mg once daily, also continued until disease progression or unacceptable side effects are observed.  Similar to the newly diagnosed chronic-phase, dose escalation may be considered up to 600mg daily based on clinical response and tolerability.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Bosutinib in patients under 18 years of age have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The dose needs to be adjusted based on several factors:

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Reduced starting dose is recommended for patients with mild, moderate, or severe liver impairment.  Dose adjustments also are made during treatment if liver enzyme levels rise significantly.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary for patients with reduced kidney function (decreased creatinine clearance).
* **Toxicity:**  Dose reduction or temporary withholding of the medication may be required if significant side effects such as low blood cell counts (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), severe diarrhea, or other serious adverse reactions occur.

**Administration:** Bosutinib tablets should be swallowed whole with food.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Chest pain
* Edema (swelling)
* Abdominal pain
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Skin rash
* Itchiness (pruritus)
* Low potassium levels (hypokalemia)
* Low phosphate levels (hypophosphatemia)
* Anemia
* Low white blood cell count (leukopenia, neutropenia)
* Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Weakness (asthenia)
* Back pain
* Cough
* Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
* Fever


Less common but serious side effects include:

* Cardiac failure
* QT prolongation (on ECG)
* Pancreatitis
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Renal toxicity (kidney damage)
*  Severe allergic reactions


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Bosutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). It works by blocking the activity of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase enzyme, which is abnormally active in CML cells and drives the growth and spread of the cancer. By inhibiting this enzyme, Bosutinib helps to slow or stop the progression of the disease.  It also inhibits other kinases in the Src family, which may contribute to its effectiveness.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Bosutinib is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug, a history of long QT syndrome, uncorrected low potassium or magnesium levels, and (according to some guidelines) significant liver impairment.

* **Drug Interactions:** Bosutinib can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4.  Some common interacting medications are proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2-antagonists, antacids, grapefruit juice, St. John's wort, and certain other drugs.  Your doctor needs to be fully aware of all other medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Bosutinib can harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least two weeks after stopping the medication.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least two weeks after the last dose.

* **Other Precautions:**  Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression (low blood cell counts), gastrointestinal problems, liver and kidney function abnormalities, and cardiovascular problems.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Bosutinib?** A: No. Grapefruit juice can significantly increase Bosutinib levels in your blood, increasing the risk of side effects. Avoid it completely.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose and it's been less than 12 hours, take it as soon as possible. If it's been more than 12 hours, skip the missed dose and take your next dose as scheduled. Don't double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Bosutinib?** A: Store Bosutinib as directed on the medication label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Is Bosutinib safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use is common in CML management. Regular monitoring is essential to assess efficacy and manage potential side effects.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects.  They will determine the appropriate management strategy.
