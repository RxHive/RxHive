# Benidipine + Telmisartan + Chlorthalidone

It's crucial to understand that there is **no currently approved generic combination drug containing Benidipine, Telmisartan, and Chlorthalidone** available in most markets.  While these three drugs are all used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure), they are typically prescribed individually or in combinations of two, not three, in a single pill.

Therefore, providing details on a nonexistent generic combination is not possible.  To get accurate information, one must consult a physician or pharmacist regarding the use of these medications in combination, as the dosage and potential side effects will depend on the specific drugs and dosages prescribed.

However, I can offer information on each individual drug and their typical uses and side effects:

**Benidipine:**

* **Generic Name:** Benidipine
* **Usage:** Treatment of hypertension.  It's a calcium channel blocker.
* **Side Effects:**  Headache, flushing, dizziness, edema (swelling), palpitations.  More serious, though rare, side effects can occur.
* **How it Works:** Relaxes blood vessels, reducing blood pressure.

**Telmisartan:**

* **Generic Name:** Telmisartan
* **Usage:** Treatment of hypertension and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients. It's an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).
* **Side Effects:** Dizziness, fatigue, diarrhea, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), cough (less common than with ACE inhibitors).
* **How it Works:** Blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels.

**Chlorthalidone:**

* **Generic Name:** Chlorthalidone
* **Usage:** Treatment of hypertension, often used in combination with other antihypertensives.  It's a thiazide diuretic.
* **Side Effects:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances (low potassium, sodium, or magnesium), increased blood sugar.
