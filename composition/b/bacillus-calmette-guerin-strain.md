# Bacillus Calmette-Guerin strain

**Generic Name:** Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)

**Usage:**

* **Treatment of Bladder Cancer:** BCG is instilled directly into the bladder to treat non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).  This helps prevent recurrence and progression.
* **Treatment of Superficial Bladder Tumors:** BCG is used in conjunction with transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT) to reduce the risk of recurrence.
* **Prevention of Tuberculosis (TB):** In many parts of the world, BCG vaccination is used to prevent severe forms of TB, especially in children.  Its effectiveness varies by region and strain.  It's not always recommended in high-income countries due to varying efficacy and the availability of other preventive measures.


**Side Effects:**

* **Bladder Instillation (for bladder cancer):**  These can range from mild to severe. Common side effects include bladder irritation (frequency, urgency, dysuria – painful urination), hematuria (blood in the urine), and mild flu-like symptoms. More serious, though less common, side effects include granulomas (small lumps of tissue), bladder scarring, and rarely, severe systemic reactions.
* **Vaccination (for TB):**  The most common side effect is a small sore at the injection site.  More rarely, BCG vaccination can cause more serious complications, including local lymph node swelling, and, very rarely, disseminated BCG infection (especially in immunocompromised individuals).


**How it Works:**

* **For Bladder Cancer:** BCG works by stimulating an immune response within the bladder. It acts as a non-specific immunostimulant, activating immune cells to attack and destroy cancer cells.  The exact mechanisms are complex and not fully understood but involve both innate and adaptive immune responses.
* **For TB Prevention:** The BCG vaccine is a weakened (attenuated) strain of *Mycobacterium bovis*, a close relative of the TB bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.  While not offering complete protection, it primes the immune system to recognize and respond to *M. tuberculosis*, reducing the severity and likelihood of developing active TB disease.


**FAQs:**

* **Is BCG a live vaccine?** Yes, for TB prevention it is a live, attenuated vaccine.  For bladder cancer treatment, while it’s a live organism, the goal is local immune stimulation rather than systemic immunity.
* **How effective is the BCG vaccine against TB?** Its effectiveness varies greatly depending on factors such as the strain used, the individual's immune system, and the type of TB.  In some populations, it offers significant protection against severe forms of TB, especially in children, while in others, protection is less pronounced.
* **Is BCG safe?**  Generally, BCG is considered safe, but like any medication or vaccine, it carries potential risks. The benefits usually outweigh the risks, but the potential side effects must be carefully considered, particularly in individuals with compromised immune systems.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects after BCG treatment for bladder cancer?**  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or severe side effects such as high fever, severe bladder pain, or blood clots.
* **Can BCG be used to treat all types of bladder cancer?** No, BCG is primarily used for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.  It's generally not effective for muscle-invasive or metastatic bladder cancer.
