# Bacillus Calmette-Guerin strain
### Generic Name
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)

### Usage
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is a vaccine primarily used to prevent tuberculosis (TB) infection, particularly in infants, children, and young adults.  It's a live, attenuated (weakened) strain of the *Mycobacterium bovis* bacterium, a close relative of the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* bacteria that causes TB.  While its primary use is preventative, BCG is also sometimes used in the treatment of specific types of bladder cancer, where it's instilled directly into the bladder.  This use is based on its ability to stimulate an immune response that can help combat the cancer cells.  It's crucial to understand that BCG's use in bladder cancer treatment is distinct from its use as a preventative TB vaccine.


### Dosage
BCG dosage varies significantly depending on the intended use (TB prevention or bladder cancer treatment) and the patient's age and health status.  Dosage information for BCG is complex and should *always* be determined and administered by a qualified healthcare professional. There is no standard dosage information that can be safely provided in this general format.  For TB prevention, the vaccine is usually given as a single subcutaneous injection. For bladder cancer treatment, it's administered intravesically (directly into the bladder) in a series of instillations, with the specific dosage and schedule determined by the oncologist.  Self-administration is never appropriate for BCG.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (TB vaccination):**

* Mild redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site.
* Small scar formation at the injection site.
* Occasionally, a small, pus-filled blister may form at the injection site.

**Less Common but More Serious Side Effects (TB vaccination):**

* Lymphadenitis (swollen lymph nodes) near the injection site.  This is usually mild but can sometimes require medical attention.
* Disseminated BCG infection (rare but serious, especially in immunocompromised individuals). This requires immediate medical intervention.


**Side Effects (Bladder Cancer Treatment):**

Side effects related to intravesical BCG treatment are common and vary in severity. These include:

* Frequent urination
* Burning sensation during urination
* Blood in the urine (hematuria)
* Flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, fatigue)
* Bladder irritation


**Important Note:** Any unusual or persistent side effects after receiving BCG should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
As a TB vaccine, BCG works by stimulating a cell-mediated immune response. The weakened bacteria trigger the body's immune system to produce T cells, a type of white blood cell that attacks and destroys *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* bacteria. This provides a degree of protection against developing active TB disease, though it doesn't guarantee complete immunity.

In bladder cancer treatment, the exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed that BCG's action involves stimulating an immune response within the bladder, leading to the destruction of cancer cells.


### Precautions
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions to BCG are possible.  Individuals with known hypersensitivity to BCG components should not receive the vaccine.
* **Immunocompromised Individuals:** BCG should be used with extreme caution, or avoided altogether, in individuals with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV/AIDS, severe immunodeficiency disorders) due to the risk of disseminated infection.
* **Pregnancy:**  The use of BCG during pregnancy should be carefully considered, and the risks and benefits weighed by a healthcare professional.  Generally, it's recommended to avoid BCG vaccination during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While specific drug interactions with BCG are uncommon, it's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Live Vaccines:** BCG should not be administered concurrently with other live vaccines.


### FAQs
* **Q: Is the BCG vaccine completely effective?**  A: No, BCG is not 100% effective in preventing TB, but it offers significant protection, especially in children. Its effectiveness varies depending on factors like the strain of the vaccine, the individual's immune response, and the prevalence of TB in the area.

* **Q: How long does BCG protection last?** A:  The duration of BCG-induced protection varies; it can wane over time, and booster doses may not always be necessary.

* **Q: How is BCG stored?** A: BCG is a temperature-sensitive vaccine and should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually under refrigeration.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects after BCG vaccination?** A: Mild side effects are common, but any significant or unusual symptoms (such as persistent fever, swelling, or pus at the injection site) should be promptly reported to a healthcare professional.
