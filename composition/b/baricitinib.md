**How it Works:**

Baricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor.  JAK enzymes are involved in immune cell signaling.  By inhibiting these enzymes, baricitinib reduces inflammation and immune responses, which is helpful in treating inflammatory conditions like RA and atopic dermatitis.  Its mechanism of action in treating COVID-19 is also believed to be related to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, reducing the inflammatory response associated with severe COVID-19.

**FAQs:**

* **Is baricitinib a steroid?** No, baricitinib is not a steroid. It works through a different mechanism.

* **How is baricitinib administered?** It's typically administered orally (as a tablet).

* **Can I take baricitinib with other medications?**  You should always inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as there may be interactions.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking baricitinib?**  It's best to avoid excessive alcohol consumption while taking baricitinib, as alcohol can interact with some medications and exacerbate potential side effects.  Discuss this with your doctor.

* **What are the long-term effects of baricitinib?** Long-term effects are still being studied, but there are concerns about an increased risk of certain infections, malignancies, and cardiovascular events.  Regular monitoring is important for patients on long-term baricitinib therapy.
