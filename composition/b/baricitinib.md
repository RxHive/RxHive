# Baricitinib
### Generic Name
Baricitinib

### Usage
Baricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor primarily used to treat moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults who haven't responded well to at least one TNF blocker (a type of biologic medication).  It's also approved for treating hospitalized adults with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).  Additionally, baricitinib is used to treat adults with severe alopecia areata (hair loss).  It's important to note that baricitinib is not a first-line treatment for any of these conditions.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Baricitinib should not be used in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs), biologic immunomodulators, or potent immunosuppressants like azathioprine and cyclosporine.  Initiation is generally not recommended if the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) is below certain thresholds (specified below for each condition) or if there are significantly low levels of neutrophils or hemoglobin.  Consult the prescribing information for exact thresholds.

**Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):** The usual adult dose is 2 mg once daily (OD). It can be used alone or with methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs.

**COVID-19:** The recommended adult dose is 4 mg OD for 14 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first.

**Alopecia Areata:** The initial adult dose is 2 mg OD. This may be increased to 4 mg OD if there isn't an adequate response. For patients with near-total or total scalp hair loss (with or without significant eyelash or eyebrow loss), treatment may start at 4 mg OD, potentially reducing to 2 mg OD once a sufficient response is seen.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of baricitinib in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  Specific adjustments vary depending on the severity of impairment and the condition being treated.  Detailed instructions are provided in the full prescribing information and should be followed carefully under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  These adjustments are crucial to avoid potential adverse events.  Monitoring of blood counts (ALC, ANC, hemoglobin) is also vital, and dosage may need to be interrupted or adjusted based on these results.  Similar monitoring is required for liver function.


### Side Effects

Common side effects vary depending on the condition being treated.  Generally, these can include:

* **Upper respiratory tract infections** (across all indications)
* **Nausea** (RA and alopecia areata)
* **Headache** (alopecia areata)
* **Increased liver enzymes (ALT/AST)** (RA, alopecia areata, and COVID-19)
* **Elevated platelets or low white blood cells (neutropenia)** (RA and alopecia areata)
* **Anemia** (alopecia areata)
* **Increased cholesterol** (alopecia areata)
* **Urinary tract infections** (alopecia areata and COVID-19)
* **Other infections** (RA, alopecia areata, and COVID-19).  See precautions for serious infection details.

Less common, but serious side effects, include serious infections, blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism),  cardiovascular events, malignancies (including lymphoma), and allergic reactions.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious or concerning side effects.

### How it Works

Baricitinib is a JAK inhibitor.  JAKs are enzymes inside cells that transmit signals from cytokines (cell messengers) and growth factors. These signals influence immune cell function and blood cell production.  By blocking JAKs, baricitinib prevents the activation of STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription), reducing inflammation and modulating the immune response. This helps to alleviate the symptoms and progression of conditions like RA, and in the case of COVID-19, it can help to mitigate the inflammatory response associated with severe disease. In alopecia areata, it's thought to modulate immune responses that contribute to hair follicle damage.

### Precautions

* **Serious Infections:**  Baricitinib increases the risk of serious infections, some potentially fatal.  Patients with chronic infections, weakened immune systems, or a history of tuberculosis should be carefully monitored and may require prophylactic treatment.  Treatment should be interrupted if a serious infection occurs.
* **Cardiovascular Events & Mortality:** There's an increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke) and all-cause mortality associated with JAK inhibitors.  Patients with cardiovascular risk factors should be closely monitored.
* **Malignancies:** An increased risk of certain types of cancers, including lymphoma, has been observed.
* **Thrombosis:**  Increased risk of blood clots.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with liver or kidney problems.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Baricitinib should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential harm to the fetus and infant.
* **Drug Interactions:** Baricitinib can interact with other medications, particularly strong OAT3 inhibitors.
* **Live Vaccines:** Live vaccines should not be given concurrently.
* **Immunization:** Ensure vaccination status is up-to-date.


### FAQs

* **Can I take Baricitinib with other medications?**  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your doctor before taking baricitinib to avoid potential interactions.

* **How should I store Baricitinib?** Store as directed on the label, usually at room temperature away from moisture and light.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **When will I see results?** The onset of effects varies depending on the condition.  Discuss expectations with your doctor.

* **What are the long-term effects of Baricitinib?** Long-term effects are not fully known, but ongoing monitoring is crucial.  Discuss concerns with your healthcare provider.
