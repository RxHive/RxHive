# Bacillus Calmette Guerin Vaccine (Live)
### Generic Name
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) Vaccine (Live)

### Usage
The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is primarily used for immunization against tuberculosis (TB), a serious infectious disease caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.  It's a live, attenuated (weakened) strain of *Mycobacterium bovis*, a bacterium closely related to the TB-causing *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.  While its main use is preventative, BCG also has a secondary, albeit less common, use in immunotherapy for certain types of urinary bladder cancer. In this context, it's administered directly into the bladder to stimulate an immune response against cancerous cells.  Note that the use of BCG for leprosy prevention is considered off-label.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the intended use and the patient's age.  Administration is always percutaneous (through the skin).

**Immunization against Tuberculosis:**

* **Infants, Children, and Adolescents:** 0.2-0.3 mL (full-strength dilution) as a single dose. A tuberculin skin test should be performed 2-3 months post-vaccination.  If negative, revaccination may be considered (at age ≥1 year).
* **Adults:** 0.2-0.3 mL (full-strength dilution) as a single dose.  A tuberculin skin test should be performed 2-3 months post-vaccination.  If negative, revaccination may be considered.

**Immunotherapy for Bladder Cancer:** This is administered by a healthcare professional and the dosage regimen is highly variable and dependent on the specific treatment protocol. It is not something that can be self-administered.

**Off-Label Use (Leprosy Prevention):** 0.2-0.3 mL (full-strength dilution).  While a single dose offers some protection, an additional dose might increase effectiveness; however, optimal timing between doses isn't clearly established in research.  It's crucial to consider the timing of vaccination relative to any chemoprophylaxis, as the latter could kill the BCG strain.


### Side Effects
Common side effects, which usually appear at the injection site and are generally mild, include:

* Induration (hardening)
* Redness
* Swelling
* Itching
* Tenderness
* Small pustule formation
* Skin ulceration

Less common, but more serious, side effects can occur, such as:

* BCG infection (including osteomyelitis – bone infection) – this is particularly a concern in immunocompromised individuals.
* Enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) – sometimes requiring surgical removal.
* Flu-like symptoms
* Allergic reactions (rare but potentially severe)

If any adverse effects occur, especially severe ones, it's essential to seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works
For TB prevention, the BCG vaccine works by stimulating a cell-mediated immune response. The weakened *M. bovis* bacteria in the vaccine mimic a *M. tuberculosis* infection, prompting the body to develop immunity against the actual TB-causing bacteria. This immunity isn't always complete, and the effectiveness varies depending on factors such as the strain of BCG used and the individual's immune response.

In bladder cancer immunotherapy, BCG is thought to induce a local inflammatory response within the bladder, stimulating the immune system to attack cancerous cells.  The exact mechanism is complex and not fully understood.


### Precautions
BCG vaccine is contraindicated (should not be given) in:

* Individuals with known hypersensitivity to BCG or its components.
* Immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV infection, leukemia, lymphoma, those undergoing cancer treatment).
* Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., corticosteroids).
* Individuals with active tuberculosis.

BCG should be used with caution in:

* People at high risk of HIV infection.
* Patients with aneurysms, prosthetic devices, or at risk of ectopic BCG infection in those areas.
* Patients with a small bladder capacity (in the context of bladder cancer treatment).

Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before receiving BCG vaccination.  BCG is generally not recommended during pregnancy due to the theoretical risk to the fetus.

There are potential interactions with other medications, particularly antimicrobials and immunosuppressants, which can interfere with the vaccine's efficacy or increase the risk of infections.  Consult with a doctor about any medications you are currently taking.


### FAQs
**Q: How long does BCG protection last?**  A: The duration of protection against TB offered by the BCG vaccine varies and isn't lifelong.  Its effectiveness in preventing TB disease is debated, and it is generally not considered as effective as other TB interventions.

**Q: How is the BCG vaccine administered?** A: BCG is always administered percutaneously (through a small puncture in the skin) by a trained healthcare professional.


**Q: What should I do if I experience a reaction at the injection site?**  A: Most reactions are mild and resolve on their own. However, if you experience significant pain, swelling, or any other concerning symptoms, consult your healthcare provider.


**Q: Can I receive other vaccines at the same time as the BCG vaccine?** A:  It's generally recommended to administer live vaccines, including BCG, at least 30 days apart from other live vaccines to avoid compromising the immune response.


**Q: How should I store the BCG vaccine?** A:  BCG vaccines must be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically under refrigeration.  Never freeze.
