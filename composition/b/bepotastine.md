# Bepotastine
### Generic Name
Bepotastine

### Usage
Bepotastine is primarily used to treat the itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.  Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye) caused by an allergic reaction, often to pollen, dust mites, or pet dander.  The itching is a major symptom of this condition, and bepotastine helps alleviate this discomfort.  While its primary use is for allergic conjunctivitis, it does not treat the underlying allergy itself.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For allergic conjunctivitis, the typical dose is one drop of 1.5% bepotastine ophthalmic solution in the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID).

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of bepotastine in children under 2 years of age have not been established.  For children 2 years and older, the dosage is the same as for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's label does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before altering the dosage based on these factors.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (Occurring in more than 1% of patients):**

* Dysgeusia (distorted sense of taste)
* Headache
* Eye irritation
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and pharynx)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  While less frequent, hypersensitivity reactions (such as skin rash, swelling of the lips or tongue, pharyngeal edema, and pruritus (itching)) have been reported.  If any serious or unusual side effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Bepotastine is a histamine H1-receptor antagonist.  Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction, causing inflammation and itching.  Bepotastine works by blocking the histamine receptors on cells in the eye, preventing histamine from binding and reducing the allergic response.  It also inhibits the release of histamine from mast cells, further minimizing the allergic reaction.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Bepotastine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to bepotastine or any component of the formulation.
* **Interactions:**  No significant drug interactions have been reported in the manufacturer's labeling. However, it's always important to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Avoid touching the dropper tip to any surface to prevent contamination. Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use.  Contact lenses should be removed before application and may be reinserted 10 minutes afterward, unless the eyes are still red.  Bepotastine should not be used to treat contact lens-related irritation.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of bepotastine during pregnancy and lactation is not fully established. Consult a doctor before using bepotastine if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for bepotastine to work?** A:  The onset of effect varies but relief from itching is typically observed within a short time after application.

* **Q: Can I use bepotastine with other eye drops?** A: It's best to consult your doctor or pharmacist.  Using multiple eye drops concurrently might impact effectiveness or cause interactions.  Administer eye drops at least 5-10 minutes apart.

* **Q: How should I store bepotastine?** A: Store bepotastine at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Can I use bepotastine if I have a corneal ulcer or other serious eye condition?** A:  No. Bepotastine is for allergic conjunctivitis only.  Seek immediate medical attention for serious eye problems.  Always consult your ophthalmologist before using any eye medication if you have a pre-existing eye condition.
