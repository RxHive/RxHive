# Bepotastine

**Generic Name:** Bepotastine Besilate

**Usage:**

Bepotastine besilate is an antihistamine used to treat the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis (allergic eye inflammation), such as itching, redness, and watering eyes.  It's available as eye drops.  It is *not* typically used to treat other allergic conditions like hay fever or hives.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eyes after application.
* Eye irritation.
* Headache.
* Bitter taste.

Less common side effects may include:

* Eye pain.
* Eye discharge.
* Blurred vision.
* Dry eyes.
* Conjunctival hyperemia (redness of the conjunctiva).


Serious side effects are rare but should be reported to a doctor immediately if they occur.

**How it Works:**

Bepotastine besilate is a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist. This means it works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking histamine, it reduces the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.  It's considered a relatively non-sedating antihistamine, meaning it's less likely to cause drowsiness compared to some oral antihistamines.
