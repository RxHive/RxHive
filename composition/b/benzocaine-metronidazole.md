# Benzocaine + Metronidazole

There is no single generic combination drug that combines benzocaine and metronidazole in a readily available, FDA-approved formulation.  While both ingredients are used to treat certain conditions, they are generally used separately.  Benzocaine is a local anesthetic, while metronidazole is an antibiotic.  Combining them would require a compounded medication, prepared by a pharmacist specifically for an individual patient's needs, and under the direction of a physician. This is not a standard, readily available product.

Therefore, providing details in the requested format is not possible for a generic "Benzocaine + Metronidazole" product because such a generic combination does not exist.  Instead, here's information on each drug individually:
