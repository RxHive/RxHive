# Buclizine

**Generic Name:** Buclizine

**Usage:** Buclizine is an antihistamine used primarily to treat vertigo (dizziness) and nausea associated with motion sickness, labyrinthitis (inner ear inflammation), and other vestibular disorders.  It's also sometimes used off-label for other types of nausea and vomiting.  It's available in both prescription and over-the-counter formulations (though OTC availability may vary by region).

**Side Effects:**  Buclizine's side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a common and potentially significant side effect, making it important to avoid driving or operating machinery after taking buclicine.
* **Dry mouth:**  This can be alleviated by drinking plenty of fluids.
* **Blurred vision:** This can also impair driving or operating machinery.
* **Constipation:** Increasing fiber and fluid intake can help mitigate this.
* **Dizziness or lightheadedness:** This can be paradoxical, given its use for vertigo, but it can occur in some individuals.
* **Sedation:**  Similar to drowsiness, but potentially more profound.
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling unusually tired.
* **Headache:**  A common side effect of many medications.
* **Difficulty urinating:** In rare cases.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Though uncommon, symptoms can include rash, hives, itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.

**How it Works:** Buclizine is a centrally acting antihistamine with anticholinergic and antiemetic properties. It works by blocking histamine H1 receptors in the central nervous system, thereby reducing the symptoms of vertigo and nausea.  The exact mechanism by which it reduces nausea is not fully understood, but it's thought to affect neurotransmission in areas of the brain involved in vomiting reflexes.
