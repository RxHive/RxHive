# Biotin + Acetylcysteine + Calcium Pantothenate + Selenium + Copper + Zinc Oxide

**Generic Name:** Biotin, Acetylcysteine, Calcium Pantothenate, Selenium, Copper (as Copper gluconate or similar salt), Zinc Oxide  *(Note: This is a combination product; there isn't one single generic name.)*

**Usage:**  This combination supplement is often marketed to support hair, skin, and nail health, and as an antioxidant.  The specific rationale for combining these ingredients varies by manufacturer, but generally, the intended uses leverage the individual properties of each component:

* **Biotin (Vitamin B7):** Crucial for hair, skin, and nail growth.
* **Acetylcysteine (NAC):** Antioxidant properties; may help with detoxification.  Sometimes used to support respiratory health.
* **Calcium Pantothenate (Vitamin B5):** Involved in energy production and metabolism; important for healthy skin and hair.
* **Selenium:** Antioxidant; may support immune function.
* **Copper:**  Plays a role in collagen production (important for skin and connective tissue) and iron metabolism.
* **Zinc Oxide (Zinc):**  Supports immune function, wound healing, and protein synthesis; also important for healthy hair, skin, and nails.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and depend on dosage and individual sensitivities. They may include:

* **Biotin:**  In very high doses, may cause acne-like skin reactions or digestive upset.
* **Acetylcysteine:**  May cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or headache.  Rarely, more severe allergic reactions can occur.
* **Calcium Pantothenate:**  Generally well-tolerated; high doses may cause diarrhea.
* **Selenium:**  High doses can be toxic; symptoms include nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and nail changes.
* **Copper:**  High doses can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps.  In rare cases, liver damage.
* **Zinc:**  High doses can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps.  Can interfere with copper absorption.


**How it Works:** Each ingredient works through different mechanisms, but the overall effect is intended to promote overall health and well-being, primarily by acting as antioxidants and supporting processes important for hair, skin, and nail health. The antioxidants help neutralize free radicals, protecting cells from damage.  The other ingredients contribute to various metabolic processes and structural components of skin, hair, and nails.
