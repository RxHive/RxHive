# Bacitracin (Topical)
### Generic Name
Bacitracin (Topical)

### Usage
Bacitracin topical ointment is primarily used to prevent infection in minor cuts, scrapes, and burns.  It's a topical antibiotic, meaning it works only on the skin's surface and isn't absorbed into the bloodstream in significant amounts.  It's important to note that bacitracin is for preventing infection, not treating an existing one.  If a wound shows signs of serious infection (increased pain, swelling, redness, pus, or fever),  prompt medical attention is necessary.

### Dosage
**Adults and Children:** For the prevention of infection in minor cuts, scrapes, or burns, a small amount of bacitracin ointment (typically 500 units/g) should be applied to the affected area 1 to 3 times daily.  The amount needed is generally a small dab, about the size of the tip of a finger.  The treated area can be covered with a clean bandage.  For children, the same application method applies, but parental supervision is essential to ensure safe use and prevent accidental ingestion.  Use should generally be limited to less than 7 days unless a healthcare professional advises otherwise.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

*   Skin irritation (redness, itching, rash)
*   Burning sensation at the application site

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis in rare instances). Symptoms might include hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.  Seek immediate medical help if these occur.


### How it Works
Bacitracin is a polypeptide antibiotic. It works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  Bacteria need these cell walls to survive, and by disrupting their formation, bacitracin prevents the bacteria from growing and multiplying, thereby helping to prevent infection in minor wounds.


### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:** Bacitracin should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to bacitracin or any component of the formulation. It's also generally contraindicated in atopic patients (those prone to eczema or other allergic skin conditions) due to a higher risk of allergic reactions.
*   **Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known.
*   **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with a history of bacitracin exposure, as repeated exposure increases the risk of allergic reactions. Anaphylaxis is a serious, though rare, possibility.  The topical ointment is for external use only; avoid contact with eyes. Do not use on deep wounds, animal bites, or serious burns without consulting a doctor.  Pregnancy category C: The safety of bacitracin during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established. Consult your doctor before use if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  If symptoms worsen or persist for more than a week, consult a healthcare professional.
