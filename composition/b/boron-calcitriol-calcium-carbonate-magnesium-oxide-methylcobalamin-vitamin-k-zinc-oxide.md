# Boron + Calcitriol + Calcium Carbonate + Magnesium Oxide + Methylcobalamin + Vitamin K + Zinc Oxide

This combination of ingredients represents a multi-nutrient supplement targeting bone health and overall well-being, but lacks a single generic name as it's a formulated product rather than a single drug.  Each ingredient has its own established uses, and combining them aims for synergistic effects.  However, it's crucial to consult a doctor before using any such supplement, as interactions and contraindications with existing medications are possible.

**Generic Name:**  *(None â€“ This is a combination product)*


**Usage:**  This combination is often used to:

* **Improve bone health:** Boron, calcium, magnesium, and vitamin K all play critical roles in bone formation and strength.  Calcitriol (a form of vitamin D) is essential for calcium absorption.
* **Support neurological function:** Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) is vital for nerve function.
* **Boost the immune system:** Zinc plays a role in immune function.


**Side Effects:** The side effects depend on the dosages of each ingredient and individual sensitivity.  Possible side effects include:

* **Constipation:** Calcium and magnesium can cause constipation, especially in higher doses.

* **Other rare side effects:**  Depend on individual sensitivities and may include allergic reactions, headaches, etc.


**How it Works:**

* **Boron:** Plays a role in bone metabolism and hormone function.
* **Calcitriol (Vitamin D3):**  Increases calcium absorption from the gut.  Essential for calcium's role in bone health.
* **Calcium Carbonate:** Provides calcium, the primary mineral component of bone.
* **Magnesium Oxide:**  Important for bone mineralization and muscle function. Works synergistically with calcium.
* **Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):**  Essential for nerve function and red blood cell formation.
* **Vitamin K:**  Important for bone metabolism and blood clotting.
* **Zinc Oxide:**  Supports immune function and wound healing.
