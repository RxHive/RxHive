# Betahistine
### Generic Name
Betahistine

### Usage
Betahistine is primarily used to reduce the frequency and severity of vertigo (a sensation of spinning or dizziness) associated with Ménière's disease.  Ménière's disease is an inner ear disorder causing episodes of vertigo, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and hearing loss. Betahistine's mechanism of action may help improve blood flow to the inner ear and balance the inner ear's neurological functions, thus alleviating vertigo symptoms.  While not explicitly approved for other conditions, some anecdotal evidence suggests potential benefits in other vestibular disorders, but more research is needed to confirm these effects.  Always consult a healthcare professional to determine if Betahistine is appropriate for your specific condition.

### Dosage
Dosage of Betahistine varies depending on the salt form (dihydrochloride or mesilate) and individual response.  It's crucial to follow your doctor's prescribed dosage exactly.

* **Adults (Ménière's Disease):**
    * **Betahistine dihydrochloride:**  The typical starting dose is 8-16 mg three times a day (TID) or 24 mg twice a day (BID), with a maximum daily dose of 48 mg. The dosage is adjusted according to individual response. Improvement may be noticed within a few days or weeks.
    * **Betahistine mesilate:** The typical starting dose is 6-12 mg three times a day (TID). Dosage adjustments are made based on individual response.
* **Children:** The safety and efficacy of Betahistine in children have not been established, and it is generally not recommended for use in pediatric patients.
* **Dosage Adjustments:**  Specific dosage adjustments for renal or hepatic impairment aren't explicitly defined in standard guidelines. However, since Betahistine is primarily metabolized by the liver, caution is advised in individuals with liver disease.  Always consult a doctor before using Betahistine if you have kidney or liver problems.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):

* Headache
* Nausea
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects:

* Confusion
* Convulsions
* Drowsiness
* Hallucinations
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure), including orthostatic (sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing) and postural hypotension
* Tachycardia (rapid heartbeat)
* Ventricular premature contractions (irregular heartbeats)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Abdominal distension, pain, bloating, vomiting
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin rash
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a rare but serious skin reaction)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Hypersensitivity reactions

If you experience any side effects, particularly serious ones, stop taking Betahistine and consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Betahistine acts on histamine receptors in the body.  It's a partial agonist at H1 receptors (meaning it partially activates them) and an antagonist at H3 receptors (meaning it blocks them).  The exact mechanism by which it reduces vertigo symptoms in Ménière's disease is not fully understood, but it's believed to improve blood flow to the inner ear and modulate the activity of nerves involved in balance.  By affecting these histamine receptors, it may help to balance inner ear function and reduce the episodes of vertigo.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Betahistine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Betahistine or any of its components, active peptic ulcer disease, pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland), pregnancy, lactation, and children under 18 years of age.
* **Interactions:** Betahistine may interact with other medications.  Specifically, it may decrease the effects of beta-2 agonists, while antihistamines may reduce Betahistine's effectiveness.  MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) may increase Betahistine's effects.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with asthma, cardiovascular disease, hepatic impairment, elderly patients, and those taking antihistamines.  Always consult your physician before starting Betahistine if you have any underlying health conditions.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Betahistine with food?** A: Yes, you can take Betahistine with or without food. If you experience gastrointestinal side effects, taking it with food may help.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: Improvement in vertigo symptoms may be observed within the first few days to weeks of treatment, but the time it takes to notice a beneficial effect varies among individuals.

* **Q: How should I store Betahistine?** A: Store Betahistine as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Betahistine suddenly?** A:  It's generally not recommended to stop taking Betahistine suddenly. Consult your doctor before discontinuing the medication, as they can help you gradually reduce the dosage to minimize potential withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: Is Betahistine addictive?** A: Betahistine is not considered an addictive medication.
