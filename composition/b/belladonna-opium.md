# Belladonna + Opium
### Generic Name
Belladonna and Opium

### Usage
Belladonna and Opium suppositories are used to manage severe pain associated with ureteral spasm that requires an opioid analgesic.  This combination medication isn't suitable for all types of pain and is reserved for specific situations where other pain relief options have proven ineffective.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For pain associated with ureteral spasm, the rectal route is used.  One suppository (containing Belladonna 15 mg and Opium 65 mg) is administered one to two times daily, with a maximum of four doses per day.  Dosage should be individualized based on pain severity, patient response, prior analgesic experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse.

**Children/Adolescents:** For adolescents experiencing pain associated with ureteral spasm, one suppository (15mg Belladonna and 65mg Opium) can be administered once or twice daily (OD or BD).  The maximum daily dose remains four suppositories.  Again, individualization of dosage is crucial, considering the factors mentioned above for adults.  Use in younger children is not typically recommended due to formulation and dosage considerations.  Always follow a physician's specific instructions.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment; use is contraindicated in cases of severe impairment in either organ system.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Dizziness, drowsiness, constipation, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth (xerostomia), blurred vision, urinary retention, palpitations, itching (pruritus), and hives (urticaria).
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Respiratory depression (a life-threatening side effect),  hypotension (low blood pressure),  and allergic reactions.  Hypogonadism (reduced sex hormone function) has been reported in post-marketing surveillance.

**Important:**  If any adverse effects occur, contact a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Belladonna contains atropine and scopolamine. Atropine works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, at various sites in the body.  This action leads to relaxation of smooth muscles (like those in the ureters) and reduced secretions.  Opium contains morphine, an opioid that binds to opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS).  This binding inhibits pain signals traveling up the spinal cord to the brain, thus altering the perception and experience of pain.  The combination works synergistically to relieve ureteral spasm pain.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  Belladonna and Opium suppositories are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Belladonna, Opium, or any component; significant respiratory depression; acute or severe bronchial asthma (unless in a monitored setting); concurrent or recent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs); gastrointestinal obstruction; glaucoma; severe renal or hepatic disease; opioid idiosyncrasies; convulsive disorders; acute alcoholism; delirium tremens; or premature labor.

**Warnings:** Increased risk of respiratory depression, CNS depression, hypotension, and phenanthrene hypersensitivity exists.  Use with caution in patients with hypersensitivity to other opioid agonists; adrenal insufficiency; biliary tract dysfunction; cardiovascular disease; history of opioid abuse; head injury; prostatic hyperplasia; toxic psychosis; significant COPD or cor pulmonale; decreased respiratory reserve; hypoxia; hypercapnia; pre-existing respiratory depression; seizure disorders; myxedema; cachexia; debilitation; or in elderly patients.

**Boxed Warnings:**  This medication carries boxed warnings regarding addiction, abuse, and misuse; life-threatening respiratory depression; accidental exposure (especially in children); neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome; and risks from concomitant use with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants.

### FAQs
