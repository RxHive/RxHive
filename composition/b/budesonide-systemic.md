# Budesonide (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Budesonide (Systemic)

### Usage

Budesonide is a corticosteroid used to treat inflammatory conditions in the intestines.  Its primary use is in managing mild to moderate active Crohn's disease affecting the ileum and/or ascending colon in patients 8 years and older.  It's also used for maintaining remission of this condition for up to three months in adults.  Furthermore, budesonide (specifically the extended-release tablet formulation) is indicated for inducing remission in patients with active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.  It's important to note that while not officially FDA-approved for these conditions, budesonide is sometimes used off-label to treat eosinophilic esophagitis and microscopic (lymphocytic and collagenous) colitis.  Always discuss all treatment options with your doctor.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the formulation of budesonide used (capsule, granules, extended-release tablet, viscous liquid/suspension).  It is crucial to follow your doctor's prescribed dosage regimen precisely.  The following is for informational purposes only and should not substitute for personalized medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Crohn's Disease (Active):**  Typically, 9 mg orally once daily in the morning for up to 8 weeks.  For maintenance of remission after achieving symptom control, the dosage may be reduced to 6 mg once daily for up to 3 months, followed by a gradual tapering off.
* **Ulcerative Colitis (Active):** 9 mg of the extended-release tablet once daily in the morning for up to 8 weeks.
* **Off-label uses (Eosinophilic Esophagitis and Microscopic Colitis):** Dosages vary significantly and are highly individualized, requiring careful monitoring and titration by a specialist.

**Children:**

Dosage for children depends heavily on the specific condition, age, and weight, and often requires adjustments based on clinical response.  Always follow your pediatrician's instructions. For Crohn's disease in children aged 8 years and older weighing over 25 kg, the usual starting dose is 9 mg daily.  For eosinophilic esophagitis, the dosage is much lower and depends on the child's age and weight, starting as low as 1mg daily.

### How it Works

Budesonide is a glucocorticoid, a type of steroid that reduces inflammation. It works by affecting several cellular processes, including:

* Decreasing the production of inflammatory substances.
* Reducing the number of immune cells that contribute to inflammation at the site of the problem.
* Increasing the stability of cell membranes, reducing damage and further inflammation.

By acting on these mechanisms, budesonide helps to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms in inflammatory bowel diseases.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Budesonide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to budesonide or any formulation components, active tuberculosis, and systemic or local bacterial, fungal, or viral infections.
* **Drug Interactions:** Budesonide can interact with numerous medications, including antacids, certain antifungals, and some HIV medications. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Budesonide is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its safety hasn't been definitively established.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using it during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  Budesonide should be used cautiously in patients with heart failure, high blood pressure, diabetes, liver or kidney disease, glaucoma, or osteoporosis.  Long-term use can suppress the adrenal glands, requiring careful monitoring and gradual tapering of the dose to prevent withdrawal symptoms.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking budesonide suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping budesonide, especially after long-term use, can lead to adrenal insufficiency.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering the dosage.
* **Q: How should I store budesonide?** A: Store budesonide as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double up on doses.
* **Q:  Is budesonide addictive?** A: Budesonide is not considered addictive in the same way as opioids or other substances. However, long-term use can lead to dependence, meaning that your body can become accustomed to the medication and may experience withdrawal symptoms if it is stopped abruptly.
* **Q: Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking budesonide?** A:  It's best to avoid grapefruit juice while on budesonide as it can interfere with the medication's metabolism, potentially altering its effects.
