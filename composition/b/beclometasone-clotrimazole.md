# Beclometasone + Clotrimazole
### Generic Name
Beclometasone + Clotrimazole


### Usage
Beclometasone dipropionate and clotrimazole combination cream is primarily used to treat skin conditions involving both inflammation and fungal infection.  This commonly manifests as:

* **Fungal infections complicated by inflammation:**  This is the main application.  The combination tackles both the fungal infection (caused by yeasts like *Candida albicans*) and the resulting inflammation and redness.  Examples include inflamed cases of oral thrush (candidiasis of the mouth), diaper rash complicated by yeast infection, and certain types of eczema with secondary fungal infection.
* **Some types of eczema with superimposed fungal infection:** While not a first-line treatment for eczema alone, this combination can be helpful when eczema is complicated by a fungal infection, reducing both inflammation and fungal growth.

It's crucial to remember that this is a topical treatment applied directly to the affected skin area and is not intended for internal use or to treat systemic fungal infections. Always consult a doctor for diagnosis and appropriate treatment.


### Dosage
Dosage will vary depending on the specific condition, its severity, and the affected area. A doctor will provide specific instructions. Generally:

* **Adults and Children (over 12 years):** A thin layer of cream is applied to the affected area twice daily, usually morning and evening.  The frequency may be adjusted based on the response to treatment.
* **Children (under 12 years):** Use in children under 12 years should be under strict medical supervision and according to the doctor's specific instructions. The dosage is usually lower than that of adults.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Oral administration:**  This medication is for topical use only and should never be ingested.
* **IV administration:** This combination is not available in an injectable (IV) form.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Burning, itching, or stinging at the application site. Skin dryness, redness, or irritation.
* **Less Common, but Potentially Serious:** Skin thinning (especially with prolonged use), stretch marks (striae), acne-like eruptions, increased hair growth, allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing).

**Note:**  If you experience any side effects, particularly severe ones or those not listed here, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works
This combination medication works through the combined actions of its two active components:

* **Beclometasone dipropionate:** A corticosteroid, it reduces inflammation by suppressing the body's inflammatory response.  This relieves the redness, swelling, itching, and discomfort associated with inflamed skin conditions.
* **Clotrimazole:** An antifungal agent, it works by interfering with the growth and reproduction of fungi, particularly *Candida* species. This eliminates the fungal infection, a key factor in many skin problems.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used if you are allergic to either beclometasone dipropionate, clotrimazole, or any other component of the cream.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, as interactions are possible although rare with topical use.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision. The potential benefits must outweigh any potential risks to the mother or child.
* **Vulnerable Groups:**  Use in children should be under close medical supervision.  Elderly individuals might experience increased sensitivity to the effects of corticosteroids.  Avoid prolonged use on thin skin areas.
* **Eye Contact:** Avoid contact with eyes. If accidental contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?**  A: Improvement is usually seen within a few days, but complete clearing of the infection may take several weeks.  Continue using the cream as directed even if symptoms improve.
* **Q: Can I use this on my face?** A: It can be used on the face, but use it cautiously and follow your doctor's instructions carefully.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for the next dose. Do not apply a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: How should I store this cream?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep out of reach of children.
* **Q: Can I use this cream with other skincare products?** A:  It's best to consult with your doctor or pharmacist before using this cream with other topical medications or skincare products to avoid potential interactions.
