# Bromhexine

**Generic Name:** Bromhexine

**Usage:** Bromhexine is an expectorant used to treat coughs that produce mucus.  It helps to thin and loosen the mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up.  It's typically used for acute and chronic bronchitis, as well as other respiratory conditions where excessive mucus is a problem.  It is often used in combination with other cough medications.  **It is important to note that Bromhexine is not a first-line treatment for coughs and should be used as directed by a doctor.**

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach upset
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)  Rare but serious allergic reactions can occur.

More serious side effects are rare but can include liver damage.  If you experience any concerning symptoms, stop taking Bromhexine and seek medical attention.


**How it Works:** Bromhexine reduces the viscosity (stickiness) of mucus in the respiratory tract. It does this by affecting the chemical structure of the mucus, making it less thick and more easily expectorated. This facilitates the clearance of mucus from the airways.
