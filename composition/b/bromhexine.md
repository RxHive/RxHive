# Bromhexine
### Generic Name
Bromhexine

### Usage

Bromhexine is primarily used as an expectorant and mucolytic agent.  This means it helps to thin and loosen mucus in the lungs and airways, making it easier to cough up.  It's commonly prescribed for various bronchopulmonary diseases (diseases affecting the bronchi and lungs) and conditions characterized by excessive or thick mucus production that obstructs the airways. These include:

* **Acute and chronic bronchitis:**  Bromhexine helps to clear mucus buildup in the airways, easing symptoms like coughing and shortness of breath.
* **Pneumonia:** In some cases, it may be used as an adjunctive therapy (alongside other medications) to help clear mucus from the lungs in pneumonia.
* **Other respiratory tract infections:**  It can be helpful in managing respiratory infections associated with excessive mucus production.
* **Cystic fibrosis:** While not a primary treatment, it may be used to aid in mucus clearance as a supportive measure in patients with cystic fibrosis.

It is important to understand that Bromhexine only helps to remove existing mucus; it doesn't address the underlying cause of the respiratory infection or condition.  Always consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.

### Dosage

Dosage of Bromhexine varies considerably depending on the patient's age, the severity of their condition, and the route of administration (oral, intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), or inhalation).  **It is crucial to follow the prescription instructions exactly.**  The following information is for general understanding and should not be considered a substitute for medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **Oral:**  Initial doses typically range from 8-16 mg three times daily (TID) for the first 7 days, followed by 8 mg TID as needed.  Maximum daily dosage may vary depending on the formulation and should be determined by a doctor.
* **Intramuscular (IM) or Intravenous (IV):**  4-8 mg once or twice daily (OD or BID).  Administration must be done by a healthcare professional.
* **Inhalation:** 8 mg BID using a nebulizer solution (usually 2mg/mL). Again, this must be administered under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

**Children:**

Dosage for children is significantly lower and strictly dependent on age and weight.  It is vital to consult a doctor or pharmacist for precise dosage instructions as they vary greatly with different age ranges and formulations.  Always follow the prescribed dosage exactly.


### Side Effects

Like all medications, Bromhexine can cause side effects.  These are usually mild and transient, but itâ€™s important to be aware of them:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, skin rashes, angioedema), liver enzyme elevation (indicate potential liver problems), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).
* **Rare but Serious:** Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) - severe skin reactions requiring immediate medical attention.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Bromhexine's mechanism of action involves altering the properties of mucus.  It reduces the viscosity (thickness) of mucus in the respiratory tract, facilitating its removal through coughing.  This is achieved by stimulating the secretion of more watery mucus and enhancing the activity of cilia (tiny hair-like structures that propel mucus out of the airways). The overall effect is improved mucociliary clearance, helping to clear the airways and alleviate symptoms associated with mucus congestion.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Bromhexine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug or any of its components and in children under 6 years of age.
* **Interactions:** While no major drug interactions are extensively documented, caution is advised when using it concurrently with other medications. Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Avoid Bromhexine during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, and breastfeeding, as it can pass into breast milk.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with severe liver or kidney disease; dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Gastric Ulcers:**  Use cautiously in patients with a history of gastric ulcers as it may worsen symptoms.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Bromhexine with other cough medicines?** A:  It's best to consult your doctor or pharmacist before combining Bromhexine with other cough or cold medications to avoid potential interactions or adverse effects.
* **Q: How should I store Bromhexine?** A: Store as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep out of reach of children.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
