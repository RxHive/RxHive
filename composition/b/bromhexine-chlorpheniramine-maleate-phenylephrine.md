# Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine

**Generic Name:** Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  The specific symptoms it targets are:

* **Cough:** Bromhexine helps loosen and thin mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Runny nose/Nasal Congestion:** Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing congestion.
* **Sneezing/Itching/Watery Eyes:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate is an antihistamine that helps relieve these allergic-type symptoms often associated with colds and upper respiratory infections.

**It is important to note:** This combination is a symptomatic treatment only.  It does not cure the underlying infection.  If symptoms persist or worsen, consult a doctor.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects may include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is particularly associated with chlorpheniramine maleate.
* **Dry mouth:** A common side effect of both antihistamines and decongestants.
* **Nausea:**  Less common, but possible.
* **Headache:** Can occur.
* **Insomnia:**  Particularly if taken late in the day.
* **Increased heart rate:** More likely with higher doses of phenylephrine.
* **Increased blood pressure:**  Possible, especially in individuals with pre-existing hypertension.
* **Constipation:**  A possible side effect.
* **Dizziness:**  Less common but possible.
* **Allergic reactions:** While rare, allergic reactions are possible. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or other signs of a severe allergic reaction.


**How it Works:**

* **Bromhexine:**  This is an expectorant. It works by reducing the stickiness of mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up phlegm.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, thus reducing symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.
* **Phenylephrine:** This is a decongestant.  It works by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
