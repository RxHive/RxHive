# Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine
### Generic Name
Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine

### Usage

This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  It's a multi-symptom formulation, meaning it targets several symptoms simultaneously.

* **Bromhexine:** This is an expectorant, meaning it helps to thin and loosen mucus in the lungs and airways, making it easier to cough up.  This is particularly beneficial when dealing with a productive cough (a cough that brings up phlegm).

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine. It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction or infection.  Histamine contributes to symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes.  Chlorpheniramine helps to alleviate these symptoms.

* **Phenylephrine:** This is a decongestant. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion. This makes breathing easier by opening up the nasal airways.

Therefore, this triple combination medication is used to address cough, runny nose, sneezing, and nasal congestion associated with upper respiratory infections.  It's important to note that it treats *symptoms* and doesn't cure the underlying infection.


### Dosage

Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and factors like age and the severity of symptoms.  There's no single universally applicable dosage.  The medication is typically available in oral forms (tablets, syrups). Intravenous (IV) administration is not typical for this combination.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Never exceed the recommended dose.

**General Guidance (This is NOT a prescription and should not be used in place of advice from a healthcare professional):**

### How it Works

As explained in the "Usage" section, this medication acts through a combination of mechanisms:

* **Bromhexine:** Loosens mucus by reducing its viscosity.  This facilitates easier expectoration (coughing up phlegm).

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks histamine receptors, preventing histamine from binding and causing symptoms like runny nose and sneezing.

* **Phenylephrine:** Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, decreasing swelling and relieving congestion.

* **Underlying Health Conditions:** Individuals with certain health conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, glaucoma, thyroid problems, or difficulty urinating, should use caution and consult their doctor before taking this medication.
