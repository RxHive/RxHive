# Beclometasone + Neomycin + Clotrimazole + Chlorocresol
### Generic Name
Beclometasone + Neomycin + Clotrimazole + Chlorocresol

**Note:**  This combination is typically found in topical preparations (creams, ointments) for skin conditions. The specific brand name and exact formulation (concentrations of each ingredient) may vary.  Always refer to the patient information leaflet provided with your specific medication.

### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used to treat skin infections involving a combination of fungal, bacterial, and inflammatory components.  It's commonly prescribed for conditions such as:

* **Eczema (with secondary infection):**  Where eczema is complicated by bacterial or fungal infections leading to increased inflammation and discharge.
* **Dermatitis (with secondary infection):** Similar to eczema, dermatitis can be secondary infected, necessitating this multi-component treatment.
* **Ringworm (Tinea corporis) with secondary infection:** When ringworm is accompanied by a bacterial skin infection.

The individual components work synergistically to tackle different aspects of the infection:

* **Beclometasone:** A corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and itching.
* **Neomycin:** An antibiotic that fights bacterial infections.
* **Clotrimazole:** An antifungal that combats fungal infections.
* **Chlorocresol:** An antiseptic preservative added to help prevent contamination and extend shelf life of the preparation.


### Dosage
Dosage instructions will vary greatly depending on the specific product and the affected area.  **Always follow the directions on the product label or as directed by your physician.**  Generally, a small amount of cream or ointment is applied thinly to the affected area twice daily, or as prescribed. The treatment duration also varies depending on the severity and response to treatment.  There is no specific pediatric or adult dosage differentiation beyond application instructions, but the physician will determine the appropriate course. Oral or IV administration is not applicable for this topical combination.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of topical application can include:

* Skin irritation (burning, stinging, redness)
* Itching
* Dryness
* Thinning of the skin
* Skin discoloration (temporary)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, may include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing)
* Skin infections (worsening of existing infection or new infections)
* Suppression of the adrenal glands (with prolonged use of high-potency corticosteroids)


If you experience any unusual or persistent side effects, seek immediate medical advice.

### How it Works
This medication combines the actions of several active ingredients:

* **Beclometasone:** Reduces inflammation by binding to intracellular receptors, thereby suppressing the release of inflammatory mediators. This lessens swelling, redness, and itching.
* **Neomycin:** Interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death. This combats bacterial infections.
* **Clotrimazole:** Disrupts fungal cell membranes, interfering with fungal growth and causing fungal cell death. This tackles fungal infections.
* **Chlorocresol:** Acts as a preservative, inhibiting the growth of microorganisms to ensure the stability of the product.

The combination targets the multiple causative agents often present in complex skin infections.

### Precautions
* **Do not use this medication if you are allergic to any of the components.**
* **Avoid contact with the eyes and mucous membranes.**
* **Use caution in individuals with thin skin or skin damage.**
* **Inform your physician about any other medications you are taking.**
* **Long-term use or use over large areas of skin should be monitored by a doctor.**
* **Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using this medication.**
* **Do not use this medication for longer than prescribed.**  Stopping treatment prematurely could lead to recurring infection.
* **Keep this medication out of reach of children.**
