# Beclomethasone (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Beclomethasone (Systemic)

### Usage
Beclomethasone (systemic) is a corticosteroid primarily used as an add-on therapy for treating mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis.  It's specifically indicated for patients who haven't responded adequately to treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) derivatives.  This medication helps manage the inflammation associated with this bowel condition.  It is *not* a first-line treatment for ulcerative colitis.

### Dosage

**Adults (Ulcerative Colitis):** The typical adult dosage is 5 mg once daily (OD) for up to four weeks.  This is administered orally.  The duration and dosage should always be determined by a physician.


**Children:** Beclomethasone (systemic) is not recommended for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For mild to moderate impairment, dosage adjustments aren't specifically outlined in manufacturer's labeling, but caution is advised.  Beclomethasone (systemic) is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with renal impairment, however, caution is advised.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  A decrease in plasma cortisol levels is a common side effect, indicative of the medication's impact on the body's hormone production.

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  A range of side effects have been reported, though less frequently, including abdominal pain, anxiety, constipation, drowsiness, fever, headache, hypermenorrhea (heavy menstrual bleeding), influenza-like symptoms, muscle pain (myalgia), and nausea.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Beclomethasone (systemic) is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation in the body.  It achieves this by impacting several cellular processes: it controls the rate of protein synthesis, decreases the migration of inflammatory cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes and fibroblasts), and modifies capillary permeability and lysosomal stabilization. These actions collectively suppress the inflammatory response characteristic of ulcerative colitis.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Beclomethasone (systemic) is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to beclomethasone or any components of the formulation, and in those with active tubercular, local mycotic, or viral infections.

**Increased Risk:** Use of this medication may increase the risk of psychiatric disturbances (depression, euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes), visual disturbances, and adrenal suppression (suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis).

**Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using beclomethasone (systemic) in patients with diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic impairment, severe arterial hypertension, gastroduodenal ulcers, glaucoma, cataracts, osteoporosis, hypoadrenalism, or tuberculosis.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of beclomethasone (systemic) during pregnancy is unknown. Systemic corticosteroids can cause intrauterine growth restriction, and hypoadrenalism may occur in newborns whose mothers used corticosteroids during pregnancy. Other treatment options might be preferred for pregnant women.  The excretion of beclomethasone in breast milk is unknown; breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment.
