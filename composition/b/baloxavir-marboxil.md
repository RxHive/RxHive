# Baloxavir Marboxil
### Generic Name
Baloxavir Marboxil

### Usage

Baloxavir marboxil is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat and prevent influenza (the flu) infections.  Its main use is in treating influenza in adults and children 12 years and older who have experienced symptoms for 48 hours or less. It's also effective as post-exposure prophylaxis (preventative treatment) for those who have been in close contact with someone who has the flu, within 48 hours of exposure.  This means it can help reduce the severity or prevent the onset of the illness in individuals exposed to the virus.

### Dosage

**Adults (≥18 years):**  A single oral dose is administered.  The dosage depends on weight:

* **Weight < 80 kg:** 40 mg
* **Weight ≥ 80 kg:** 80 mg

**Children (12-17 years):** The dosage is the same as for adults, based on weight.

**Children (<12 years):** The safety and efficacy of baloxavir marboxil have not been established in children younger than 12 years old.

**Administration:** The medication can be taken with or without food.  The oral suspension should be gently swirled before administration, not shaken. For enteral administration, use an enteral syringe and flush with 1 mL of water before and after administration.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, although some studies suggest that mild to moderate impairment doesn't significantly affect the drug's pharmacokinetics.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance in these cases.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Diarrhea

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (post-marketing surveillance):**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, erythema multiforme)
* Skin rash, facial swelling
* Gastrointestinal issues (colitis, hematochezia, melena, vomiting, swollen tongue, lip swelling)
* Nervous system effects (abnormal behavior, delirium, hallucinations)
* Eyelid edema

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form (baloxavir) in the body.  Baloxavir inhibits the activity of the influenza virus's polymerase acidic (PA) endonuclease protein.  This enzyme is crucial for the virus's replication, so by inhibiting it, baloxavir effectively stops the virus from multiplying and spreading within the body.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Baloxavir marboxil is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to baloxavir marboxil or any of its components.
* **Interactions:** Co-administration with polyvalent cation-containing products (e.g., antacids, certain laxatives, calcium, iron, magnesium supplements) may decrease the effectiveness of baloxavir marboxil.  Concurrent use with live attenuated influenza vaccine may reduce the vaccine's effectiveness.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Baloxavir marboxil is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to a lack of sufficient safety data.
* **Other Precautions:**  Monitor for secondary bacterial infections.  The clinical benefit of antiviral drugs, including baloxavir marboxil, may be affected by factors such as the specific influenza strain, viral resistance, or changes in viral virulence.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I take baloxavir marboxil with other medications?**
A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist.  Interactions are possible, particularly with polyvalent cation-containing products and the live attenuated influenza vaccine.

**Q: How should I store baloxavir marboxil?**
A: Store as directed on the product label.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A:  Baloxavir marboxil is typically a single dose treatment.  Contact your doctor if you have questions.

**Q:  Is baloxavir marboxil effective against all strains of influenza?**
A: The effectiveness can vary depending on the specific influenza strain and the presence of drug resistance.  Your doctor will consider this when determining treatment options.

**Q: What if I have a severe allergic reaction?**
A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Severe allergic reactions are a potential, though rare, side effect.
