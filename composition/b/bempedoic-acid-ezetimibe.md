# Bempedoic acid + Ezetimibe
### Generic Name
Bempedoic acid + Ezetimibe

### Usage
Bempedoic acid and Ezetimibe is a combination medication used to lower LDL cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol) levels in adults.  It's prescribed as an add-on treatment to a statin medication and a healthy diet, specifically for individuals with:

* **Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia:** A genetic condition causing high cholesterol levels.
* **Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease:**  A condition where cholesterol buildup has already damaged blood vessels, increasing the risk of heart attack or stroke.

This combination therapy is only used when lifestyle changes and maximum-tolerated statin therapy haven't sufficiently lowered LDL cholesterol levels and additional reduction is needed to manage cardiovascular risk.

### Dosage

The typical adult dose is one tablet (containing 180 mg of bempedoic acid and 10 mg of ezetimibe) taken once daily.  

* **Timing:**  It's crucial to take this medication at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after taking bile acid sequestrants (another type of cholesterol-lowering medication) to avoid interference with absorption.
* **Monitoring:** Lipid levels (cholesterol and other fats in the blood) should be checked 8-12 weeks after starting treatment to assess its effectiveness.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for mild hepatic (liver) impairment. However, this medication is not recommended for individuals with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for mild or moderate renal (kidney) impairment.  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for severe renal impairment.
* **Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of this combination have not been established in children.


### Side Effects

**Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Constipation
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Urinary tract infection

**Less Common, but potentially serious side effects:**

* Oral discomfort
* Hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels, potentially leading to gout)
* Tendon rupture (though rare)

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above or any other unusual symptoms, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

This combination medication works through two different mechanisms:

* **Bempedoic acid:**  Inhibits an enzyme called adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL), which plays a key role in cholesterol production in the liver. By reducing cholesterol synthesis, bempedoic acid lowers LDL cholesterol levels.
* **Ezetimibe:** Blocks the absorption of cholesterol from the intestines into the bloodstream. By reducing cholesterol uptake, it further lowers LDL cholesterol.


Together, these two components offer a synergistic effect, meaning they work better together than they would individually to decrease LDL cholesterol and reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  This medication is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to either bempedoic acid, ezetimibe, or any components of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This combination may interact with other medications, particularly statins (like simvastatin or pravastatin), fibrates, cyclosporine, and cholestyramine.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of hyperuricemia and tendon rupture with this medication, although it is relatively rare.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Bempedoic acid and Ezetimibe are not recommended during pregnancy due to potential harm to the fetus.  It's also not advised to breastfeed while taking this medication because it is unknown whether it's excreted in breast milk.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication with food?** A: Yes, this medication can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  It typically takes 8-12 weeks to see a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol levels after starting treatment.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.  Keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking this medication without consulting my doctor?** A: No, always discuss any changes to your medication regimen with your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation could negatively impact your cholesterol levels and cardiovascular health.
