# Bempedoic acid + Ezetimibe

**Generic Name:** Bempedoic acid/Ezetimibe (various brand names exist)

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to lower LDL ("bad") cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol in adults with high cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) who are unable to reach their cholesterol goals with a statin alone, or who cannot tolerate statins.  It is typically used as an add-on therapy to a statin or as an alternative for those who cannot take statins.


**Side Effects:**  The side effects of bempedoic acid/ezetimibe are generally similar to those of each drug individually, though the combination may increase the likelihood of certain side effects. Common side effects can include:

* **Musculoskeletal pain:**  Muscle aches, pain, weakness (myalgia), and/or rhabdomyolysis (rare but serious muscle breakdown) – this is especially important to monitor as it's a concern with statins, and the combination increases the risk although not as significantly as a combination with a different statin.
* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Diarrhea, constipation, nausea, abdominal pain
* **Upper respiratory infections:**  Common cold symptoms
* **Back pain:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Headache:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Rash:**
* **Increased liver enzymes:**  (requires monitoring through blood tests)
* **Elevated Creatinine:** (indicates kidney function issues – requires monitoring)

**Serious side effects are rare but include:**

* **Allergic reactions:**  (anaphylaxis, angioedema)
* **Pancreatitis:**  (inflammation of the pancreas)
* **Liver damage (hepatotoxicity):**

It's crucial to report any unusual or concerning symptoms to your doctor immediately.


**How it Works:**

* **Bempedoic acid:** Works by inhibiting an enzyme (ATP citrate lyase) involved in cholesterol synthesis in the liver, thus reducing the production of cholesterol.
* **Ezetimibe:**  Works by blocking the absorption of cholesterol in the small intestine.

By combining these two mechanisms, bempedoic acid/ezetimibe provides a more potent cholesterol-lowering effect than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take this medication if I'm already on a statin?** A: Yes, it's often prescribed as an add-on therapy to a statin when cholesterol goals aren't met with the statin alone.
* **Q: What if I can't tolerate statins?** A: This combination may be an option for you, but your doctor will need to assess your overall health and risk factors.
* **Q: How often do I need blood tests?** A: Your doctor will likely order regular blood tests to monitor your liver function, kidney function, and cholesterol levels.  The frequency will depend on your individual situation.
* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, there are potential interactions with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some significant interactions may include other lipid-lowering drugs, fibrates, and certain antibiotics.
* **Q: What are the potential long-term effects?** A: Long-term effects are still being studied, but it's important to have regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor your health and cholesterol levels.
