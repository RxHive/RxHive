# Beclomethasone (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Beclomethasone (Nasal)

### Usage

Beclomethasone nasal spray is a corticosteroid medication primarily used to treat nasal symptoms associated with allergies (both seasonal and perennial) and non-allergic rhinitis (vasomotor rhinitis).  This means it helps manage symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, and itchy nose.  It's also used to prevent the regrowth of nasal polyps after they've been surgically removed.  The medication works by reducing inflammation in the nasal passages.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (nasal suspension or aerosol), the age of the patient, and the condition being treated.  Always follow your doctor's prescription and the instructions provided with your specific medication.  Here's a general overview:

**Adults:**

* **Allergic Rhinitis & Nonallergic Rhinitis:**  Dosage ranges from 1 to 2 sprays in each nostril, one to two times daily. The total daily dose typically ranges from 168 mcg to 336 mcg.  The exact number of sprays and frequency will depend on the specific product and your doctor's instructions.  Note that different formulations deliver different amounts of beclomethasone per spray.

* **Nasal Polyps (Post-surgical):**  Dosage is similar to that for allergic rhinitis, usually 1 to 2 sprays in each nostril one to two times daily.

**Children:**

Dosage for children varies significantly based on age and the specific formulation.  Beclomethasone nasal spray is generally not recommended for children under 6 years of age, except in specific cases where the doctor deems it necessary.  For older children, the dosage is typically lower than the adult dose and is carefully adjusted based on the child's response to treatment.  Always consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosage information for children.

**Important Note:**  Formulations are not interchangeable.  Always carefully check the instructions provided with your specific medication regarding the amount of beclomethasone delivered per spray.

**Administration:**

For nasal suspensions, shake well before each use and prime the pump if necessary (following the manufacturer's instructions).  For both suspensions and aerosols, spray into the nostrils, avoiding the eyes and mouth.  Rinse your mouth with water after using the spray, without swallowing the water.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat)
* Epistaxis (nosebleeds)

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% or less):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Sneezing
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Nasal congestion
* Rhinorrhea (runny nose)
* Nasal irritation
* Nasal candidiasis (yeast infection in the nose – more likely with aqueous solutions)
* Pharyngeal candidiasis (yeast infection in the throat – more likely with aqueous solutions)
* Increased intraocular pressure
* Lacrimation (tearing)
* Nausea
* Oral candidiasis (yeast infection in the mouth)
* Adrenal suppression
* Hypercortisolism (excess cortisol)
* Immunosuppression
* Decreased linear skeletal growth rate (in children)
* Fever
* Impaired wound healing

**Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  While rare, serious side effects such as allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), angioedema, glaucoma, cataracts, nasal septum perforation, and other hypersensitivity reactions may occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these.


### How it Works

Beclomethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid.  It's a prodrug, meaning it's converted in the body to its active form, beclomethasone-17-monopropionate. This active form reduces inflammation in the nasal passages by decreasing the activity of inflammatory cells and the production of inflammatory substances.  By reducing inflammation, it alleviates the symptoms of allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. The precise mechanism is complex and not fully understood, but the anti-inflammatory effect is the key to its therapeutic action.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Beclomethasone nasal spray should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity to beclomethasone or any of the product's components.  It's also contraindicated in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis or untreated fungal, bacterial, or viral infections in the nasal passages.

* **Drug Interactions:**  There are some potential drug interactions. For example, simultaneous use with desmopressin may enhance the risk of hyponatremia (low sodium levels), and interactions with esketamine may need careful management to optimize therapy. Discuss all other medications you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist before starting beclomethasone.

* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with a history of glaucoma, cataracts, or increased intraocular pressure.  Long-term use may increase the risk of nasal candidiasis.  Children and adolescents should be monitored for growth velocity.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using this medication as safety data are limited.  Adrenal suppression can occur, particularly with higher doses and prolonged use.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies, but many individuals experience symptom relief within a few days of starting treatment, although maximal benefit may take several weeks.

* **Q: Can I use it if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: Consult your doctor before using beclomethasone if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. The safety profile during pregnancy and lactation isn't fully established.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store the medication as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from direct heat and light.

* **Q: Can I stop using it suddenly?** A:  Generally, it's advisable not to stop using beclomethasone suddenly, especially if you have been using it for a long period.  Your doctor should help you gradually decrease the dosage to minimize any potential withdrawal effects.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
