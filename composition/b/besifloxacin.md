# Besifloxacin
### Generic Name
Besifloxacin

### Usage
Besifloxacin is an ophthalmic (eye) antibiotic primarily used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, commonly known as pinkeye.  It's a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone, a class of antibiotics known for their effectiveness against a wide range of bacteria.  This medication targets the bacteria causing the infection, reducing inflammation and symptoms.  It's specifically formulated for topical use in the eye, meaning it's applied directly to the affected area.

### Dosage
**Bacterial Conjunctivitis:**

* **Adults and Children (1 year and older):**  The usual dose is one drop of 0.6% besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension into the affected eye(s) three times a day (TID), spaced approximately four to twelve hours apart.  Treatment typically lasts for seven days.  Safety and efficacy haven't been established for infants under one year of age.

* **Dosage Forms:** Besifloxacin is typically available as an ophthalmic suspension (liquid).

* **Administration:**  Wash hands thoroughly before and after application. Gently pull down the lower eyelid to create a pocket, and instill the prescribed number of drops into the pocket.  Avoid touching the tip of the dropper to any surface, including the eye or surrounding skin, to prevent contamination.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, adjustments may not be necessary due to the low systemic absorption of besifloxacin when applied topically to the eyes.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of users) may include:

* Headache
* Conjunctival erythema (redness of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the eyelid and covering the white part of the eye)
* Blurred vision
* Eye irritation
* Eye pain
* Eye itching (pruritus)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, such as allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis),  should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Besifloxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic. This means it kills bacteria, rather than just inhibiting their growth.  It achieves this by interfering with two essential enzymes in bacteria: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.  These enzymes are vital for bacterial DNA replication, transcription (the process of making RNA from DNA), repair, and cell division.  By inhibiting these enzymes, besifloxacin prevents the bacteria from multiplying and effectively eliminates the infection.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Besifloxacin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to besifloxacin, other fluoroquinolones, or any component of the formulation.
* **Superinfection:**  Prolonged use may lead to an overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms or fungal infections.  Monitor for signs of superinfection.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Be aware of the possibility of hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild skin reactions to severe anaphylaxis. Discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention if a serious allergic reaction occurs.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of besifloxacin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult a healthcare professional before using this medication if pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Potential interactions exist with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are currently taking.  Some examples of potential interactions are described in the provided details, but this is not an exhaustive list. Always consult your healthcare provider.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for besifloxacin to work?** A: Improvement in symptoms usually begins within a few days, but the full course of treatment (7 days) should be completed for optimal results.

* **Q: Can I wear contact lenses while using besifloxacin?** A: No.  It's recommended to avoid contact lens use during treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store besifloxacin?** A: Store besifloxacin at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q:  Can I use besifloxacin for other eye conditions?** A: No. Besifloxacin is specifically for bacterial conjunctivitis. Use it only as prescribed by a doctor.  If you have other eye concerns, consult an ophthalmologist.
