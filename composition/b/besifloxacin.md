It's specifically effective against many common bacteria that cause this infection.  It's applied directly to the eye(s).  It is *not* used for other types of eye infections or conditions.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions regarding dosage and duration of treatment.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects are usually mild and may include:

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Severe eye pain
* Vision changes (lasting)


If you experience any serious side effects, stop using the medication and seek immediate medical attention.

**How it Works:**

Besifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic.  It works by interfering with the DNA replication of bacteria, thus preventing their growth and multiplication. This ultimately helps to clear the bacterial infection in the eye.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  Improvement in symptoms should be noticeable within a few days, but it's crucial to complete the full course of treatment as prescribed, even if symptoms improve earlier.  Stopping early can lead to recurrence of the infection.

* **Q: Can I wear contact lenses while using Besifloxacin?** A:  Generally, you should not wear contact lenses while using Besifloxacin ophthalmic solution.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific guidance.

* **Q: Can I use Besifloxacin for other eye infections?** A: No. Besifloxacin is only effective against certain types of bacterial conjunctivitis.  Using it for other eye conditions may be ineffective and could potentially harm your eyes.  Always consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment of eye infections.

* **Q:  Are there any drug interactions?** A: While rare, some interactions are possible. Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
