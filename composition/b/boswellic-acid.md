# Boswellic Acid
### Generic Name
Boswellic Acid

### Usage
Boswellic acid, derived from the *Boswellia serrata* tree (Indian frankincense), is primarily used to manage chronic inflammatory conditions.  Its anti-inflammatory properties make it a potential treatment option for various ailments, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and bronchial asthma.  While research continues, it's important to note that the evidence supporting its effectiveness varies across these conditions.  It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using boswellic acid for any health concern.

### Dosage
Dosage recommendations for boswellic acid vary depending on the specific condition being treated and the formulation used.  There's no universally standardized dosage.  Always follow your healthcare provider's instructions and the dosage guidelines provided by the manufacturer. The following are examples of dosages that have been studied, and they are not a substitute for professional medical advice:

* **Chronic Inflammatory Illnesses (General):**  Oral administration is typical, with doses ranging from 300-500 mg twice or thrice daily.
* **Osteoarthritis:**  Studies have used extracts of around 333 mg three times a day.
* **Rheumatoid Arthritis:**  Higher daily doses, such as 3600 mg, have been investigated in some studies.
* **Ulcerative Colitis:**  Some studies have employed 350 mg of a gum resin preparation three times daily.
* **Bronchial Asthma:**  Doses of 300 mg three times daily have been explored.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of boswellic acid in children haven't been established.  It should not be given to children without specific guidance from a pediatrician.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild but can include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms, immediately consult your doctor.


### How it Works
Boswellic acid's anti-inflammatory action is believed to be primarily mediated through the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX).  5-LOX is an enzyme involved in the production of leukotrienes, potent inflammatory mediators. By suppressing 5-LOX activity, boswellic acid reduces the production of leukotrienes, thus lessening inflammation.

### Precautions
* **Pregnancy:** Boswellic acid is contraindicated during pregnancy; it may increase the risk of miscarriage.
* **Breastfeeding:**  It's unknown whether boswellic acid is excreted in breast milk; therefore, its use during breastfeeding is not recommended.
* **Menstruation:** Boswellic acid might increase menstrual flow.
* **Interactions:**  The potential for interactions with other medications is not fully understood.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before using boswellic acid.
* **Long-Term Safety:** The long-term safety and efficacy of boswellic acid are not fully established.
