# Brodalumab
### Generic Name
Brodalumab

### Usage
Brodalumab is a prescription medication used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults.  It's specifically indicated for individuals who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, and haven't responded adequately to, or have lost their response to, other systemic treatments for psoriasis.  The primary use is to reduce the symptoms of plaque psoriasis, such as raised, red, scaly patches on the skin.  Currently, there are no notable secondary uses approved.

### Dosage
Brodalumab is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) as a 210 mg injection. The typical dosing schedule involves injections at weeks 0, 1, and 2, followed by a 210 mg injection every two weeks.  Treatment should be discontinued if a satisfactory response isn't seen after 12-16 weeks, as continuing beyond this point is unlikely to improve outcomes.  The medication is not approved for use in children, and dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10% incidence) include various infections (like bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, and urinary tract infections).

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include fatigue, tinea infections, diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia (low white blood cell count), the development of antibodies against the drug, fungal infections, influenza, and injection-site reactions (such as pain, bruising, redness, or itching).

Less common, but serious side effects, reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports, include candidiasis (infection by yeast), conjunctivitis, Crohn's disease exacerbation, and suicidal ideation.  

**It is crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.**


### How it Works
Brodalumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by blocking interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17RA). IL-17RA is a protein on the surface of cells involved in inflammation. By binding to IL-17RA, Brodalumab prevents several inflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17C, and others) from triggering inflammatory responses in the body. This reduction in inflammation helps alleviate the symptoms of psoriasis.


### Precautions
Brodalumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, and those with active Crohn's disease.  There is a significant increased risk of infections, including tuberculosis reactivation.  Patients should be screened for tuberculosis before starting treatment.   Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, or any history of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behavior, require careful monitoring.  The use of live vaccines should be avoided while on Brodalumab.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the potential risks and benefits with their doctor before using this medication, as data on its safety in these populations is limited.
