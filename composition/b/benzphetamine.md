# Benzphetamine
### Generic Name
Benzphetamine

### Usage
Benzphetamine is primarily used as a short-term adjunct in weight loss programs for individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m² or greater who haven't achieved satisfactory results with diet and exercise alone.  It's a short-term treatment (a few weeks) to help suppress appetite and boost weight loss efforts.  It is **not** intended as a long-term solution for weight management.  It's crucial to understand that benzphetamine is only effective as part of a comprehensive weight-loss plan that includes dietary changes and increased physical activity.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical starting dose is 25-50 mg once daily.  Depending on individual response and under strict medical supervision, the doctor may increase this to 25-50 mg one to three times per day.

**Children and Adolescents (≥12 years):** The dosage is the same as for adults. However, the safety and effectiveness of benzphetamine in children under 12 years of age have not been established.

**Dosage Forms:**  Benzphetamine is typically available in oral tablet form.


**Administration:**  The medication should be taken as prescribed by a doctor.  Generally, it's recommended to take it mid-morning or mid-afternoon to minimize the potential for sleep disturbances.  The precise timing might be adjusted based on individual eating patterns.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nervous system effects: Insomnia, restlessness, headache, dizziness, depression (particularly upon withdrawal), overstimulation, and in rare cases, psychosis.
* Cardiovascular effects: Palpitations, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), and increased blood pressure.  In cases of chronic use of similar medications, cardiomyopathy and ischemic heart disease have been reported.
* Gastrointestinal effects: Nausea, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and dry mouth.
* Dermatological effects: Skin rashes, sweating, and hives.
* Endocrine and metabolic effects: Changes in libido.
* Neuromuscular effects: Tremors.

**Serious but less common side effects** may also occur.  It's essential to seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or severe side effects.

### How it Works

Benzphetamine is a sympathomimetic amine, chemically similar to amphetamines. It works by stimulating the release of norepinephrine in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain involved in appetite regulation. This increased norepinephrine leads to appetite suppression.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Benzphetamine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to benzphetamine or other sympathomimetic amines, advanced arteriosclerosis, symptomatic cardiovascular disease (including moderate to severe hypertension), hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, agitated states, a history of drug abuse, or who are currently using or have used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) within the past 14 days.  It's also absolutely contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women.

**Drug Interactions:** Benzphetamine can interact with numerous medications, including MAOIs, other CNS stimulants, antihypertensives, and certain analgesics.  It's critical to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

**Warnings:** Benzphetamine should be used with caution in individuals with mild hypertension, diabetes mellitus, a history of seizures, Tourette syndrome, or elderly patients.  Long-term use can lead to dependence, and tolerance to the appetite-suppressing effect often develops within a few weeks.


**Specific Populations:**  Benzphetamine is not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age or during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
