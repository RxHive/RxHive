# Benzydamine

**Generic Name:** Benzydamine

**Usage:**  Benzydamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used topically to treat pain and inflammation in the mouth and throat.  Common uses include:

* **Sore throats:** Relieving pain and inflammation associated with sore throats, often from infections or irritation.
* **Mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcers):** Reducing pain and promoting healing of mouth ulcers.
* **Gingivitis:**  Helping to reduce inflammation and pain in the gums.
* **Post-extraction dental pain:**  Alleviating pain and inflammation after tooth extraction.
* **Other oral mucosal inflammation:**  Treating inflammation and pain in other areas of the mouth and throat.


**Side Effects:**  Benzydamine is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur. These are usually mild and temporary, including:

* **Mouth irritation:** Burning, tingling, or numbness in the mouth.
* **Taste alterations:** A temporary change in taste perception.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rare but possible, ranging from mild skin rashes to more serious reactions (anaphylaxis).  Signs of an allergic reaction include swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, difficulty breathing, or hives.


**How it Works:** Benzydamine acts as a non-narcotic analgesic (pain reliever) and anti-inflammatory agent. Its exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's believed to inhibit the production of prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators, thus reducing pain and swelling. It also has some local anesthetic properties, further contributing to pain relief.
