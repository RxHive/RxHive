# Benzydamine
### Generic Name
Benzydamine

### Usage

Benzydamine is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of pain and inflammation in the mouth and throat.  Its main applications are:

* **Oropharyngeal mucositis:** This is a common side effect of radiation therapy for head and neck cancers, causing painful sores and inflammation in the mouth and throat. Benzydamine helps alleviate these symptoms.
* **Acute sore throat (pharyngitis):**  Benzydamine can provide relief from the pain and discomfort associated with a sore throat.

While its primary use is in the oral cavity, some formulations might have off-label uses depending on the specific preparation and healthcare provider's guidance.  It's crucial to remember that benzydamine treats symptoms and not the underlying cause of the condition.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the formulation (oral rinse, lozenge, or spray), the age of the patient, and the condition being treated.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  The information below is for general guidance only and should not substitute for professional medical advice.


**Adults:**

* **Mucositis (oral rinse):** 15 mL (undiluted) as a gargle or rinse 3-4 times daily.  The frequency may depend on the severity of the mucositis.
* **Mucositis (lozenge):** 3 mg (1 lozenge) every 1-2 hours, not exceeding 36 mg (12 lozenges) daily.  Treatment should not exceed 7 consecutive days.
* **Mucositis (spray):** 1-2 mg (2-4 sprays of 0.3% solution or 4-8 sprays of 0.15% solution) every 1.5-3 hours until symptoms improve. Treatment should not exceed 7 consecutive days.
* **Pharyngitis (oral rinse):** 15 mL (undiluted) as a gargle every 1.5-3 hours.
* **Pharyngitis (lozenge):** Same as for mucositis.
* **Pharyngitis (spray):** Same as for mucositis.

**Children:**

Safety and dosage haven't been established for children under 6 years old. For children 6 years and older, dosage is generally the same as for adults, but it's always best to consult a pediatrician for specific guidance.  Children aged 6-12 might receive a reduced spray dosage (1 mg).  Adolescents usually follow the adult dosage.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Localized numbness
* Nausea and vomiting
* Burning sensation or stinging of the skin
* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Cough
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)

Less common but more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Benzydamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and a local anesthetic.  It works by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reducing pain and inflammation in the affected area.  Its local anesthetic properties also help numb the pain.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Benzydamine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to benzydamine or any component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients with already compromised oral mucosa might experience increased local irritation or burning.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of benzydamine during pregnancy and lactation hasn't been established. The potential benefits must be carefully weighed against the potential risks before using it in these populations.
* **Drug Interactions:** Benzydamine may interact with other medications. Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are currently taking.  Specifically, it may increase the effects of bupivacaine, and its effects may be increased by methemoglobinemia-associated agents.
