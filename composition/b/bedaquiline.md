# Bedaquiline
### Generic Name
Bedaquiline

### Usage

Bedaquiline is an antimycobacterial drug used in the treatment of pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adults and children.  It's crucial to understand that bedaquiline is *not* a standalone treatment. It's always part of a combination therapy, meaning it's used alongside at least three other drugs to which the tuberculosis bacteria are susceptible.  Bedaquiline is reserved for situations where other effective treatment regimens aren't available.  It is not used for latent TB, extrapulmonary TB, drug-sensitive TB, or infections caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria.  The safety and efficacy in HIV-infected patients with MDR-TB haven't been fully established.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the patient's age and weight, and the treatment phase.  Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) is essential for all treatment phases.

**Adults with active pulmonary MDR-TB:**

* **Weeks 1-2:** 400 mg once daily (orally).  If a dose is missed during this period, do not make up the missed dose; continue with the regular schedule.
* **Weeks 3-24:** 200 mg three times weekly (orally).  Doses should be spaced at least 48 hours apart. If a dose is missed, administer it as soon as possible and then resume the regular 3-times-weekly schedule.  The total dose in a 7-day period should not exceed the recommended weekly dose.

**Children (≥5 years) with active pulmonary MDR-TB:**

Dosage is weight-based:

* **Children 15 to <30 kg:**
    * **Weeks 1-2:** 200 mg once daily (orally)
    * **Weeks 3-24:** 100 mg three times weekly (orally), with at least 48 hours between doses.
* **Children ≥30 kg:**
    * **Weeks 1-2:** 400 mg once daily (orally)
    * **Weeks 3-24:** 200 mg three times weekly (orally), with at least 48 hours between doses.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not explicitly defined in the manufacturer's labeling for severe cases.  Use with caution and close monitoring for adverse reactions is crucial in such instances.  Mild to moderate impairment usually doesn't require dose adjustment.  For children,  therapy should be discontinued if significant hepatotoxicity occurs.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Chest pain
* Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
* Nausea
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Increased serum transaminase levels (liver enzyme elevation)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Increased serum amylase levels (pancreatic enzyme elevation)
* Skin rash

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (<1%):**

* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Prolonged QT interval on ECG (which can lead to serious heart rhythm problems)

**Important Note:**  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Bedaquiline is a diarylquinoline antimycobacterial drug. It works by inhibiting the ATP synthase of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, which is essential for the bacteria's energy production.  By disrupting this process, bedaquiline effectively inhibits the growth and replication of the bacteria. Importantly, bedaquiline does not affect human ATP synthase.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** There are no specific contraindications listed in the manufacturer’s labeling. However, use should be carefully considered in patients with known risk factors for QT prolongation or hepatic impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Bedaquiline can interact with many other medications. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.  CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors can significantly affect bedaquiline levels.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Bedaquiline is a Category B drug during pregnancy. It should only be used if the benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, therefore close monitoring of breastfed infants is warranted.
* **Increased Mortality Risk:** Studies have shown an increased risk of death in patients treated with bedaquiline compared to placebo. This risk must be carefully weighed against the potential benefits.
* **QT Prolongation:** Bedaquiline can prolong the QT interval, increasing the risk of arrhythmias. Regular ECG monitoring is necessary, especially in patients at risk for QT prolongation. Treatment should be discontinued if clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia or a QTcF interval >500 msec develops.
* **Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Monitor liver function tests (LFTs) regularly, as bedaquiline can cause hepatotoxicity.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should bedaquiline be stored?**  A: Store bedaquiline as directed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Typically, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Can I stop taking bedaquiline if I feel better?** A: No.  Tuberculosis requires a complete course of treatment, typically spanning many months, even if symptoms improve.  Stopping prematurely can lead to treatment failure and the development of drug-resistant tuberculosis.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Follow the specific instructions provided by your healthcare provider. This will vary depending on which phase of treatment you're in.
* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking bedaquiline?** A: There are no specific dietary restrictions but taking it with food is recommended to minimize side effects.
* **Q: How long will I need to take bedaquiline?** A: The duration of treatment will depend on your individual circumstances and the treatment regimen prescribed by your healthcare provider.  It typically lasts for several months.
