# Bexarotene (Topical)
### Generic Name
Bexarotene (Topical)

### Usage

Bexarotene topical gel is a medication used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a type of skin cancer.  Specifically, it's indicated for the treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients with refractory (meaning it hasn't responded to other treatments) or persistent CTCL at stages 1A and 1B. It's also used for patients who haven't tolerated other therapies for this condition.  Bexarotene works directly on the affected skin areas, targeting the cancerous cells.  It is not used to treat other forms of cancer or other skin conditions.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma):**

The dosage of Bexarotene topical gel (1%) starts with application to lesions once every other day for the first week.  The frequency is then gradually increased on a weekly basis, moving to once daily, twice daily, three times daily, and finally four times daily, depending on individual tolerance and response. The medication should be continued as long as it provides clinical benefit. A response is typically seen with application two to four times daily. If local skin irritation occurs, the frequency might be reduced; in cases of severe irritation, treatment may need to be temporarily stopped for a few days until the symptoms subside.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and effectiveness of Bexarotene topical gel have not been established in children.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, it's important to understand that liver impairment may lead to decreased clearance of Bexarotene because the liver plays a significant role in its elimination. Similarly, while renal elimination is a minor route, kidney problems may alter protein binding and the drug's pharmacokinetics.  A healthcare professional should be consulted if a patient has impaired liver or kidney function before initiating Bexarotene therapy.

### How it Works

Bexarotene is a retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist.  This means it binds to and activates specific RXR proteins within cells. These activated RXRs act as transcription factors, influencing the expression of various genes.  This ultimately results in decreased cell proliferation (growth), apoptosis (programmed cell death) of certain cancer cells, and, consequently, tumor regression in CTCL.  In simpler terms, Bexarotene helps regulate the abnormal growth of cancerous skin cells and leads to their destruction.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:**  Bexarotene is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its components, and it is absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy.
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Bexarotene is teratogenic (can cause birth defects).  It's contraindicated in pregnancy.  Women of childbearing age must use effective contraception for at least one month before, during, and one month after treatment. Regular pregnancy tests are required. The drug's excretion in breast milk is unknown; breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment.
*   **Hypersensitivity:**  Patients with known hypersensitivity to other retinoids should use Bexarotene with caution.
*   **Photosensitivity:**  Bexarotene can increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight. Patients should minimize sun exposure, use sunscreen with a high SPF, and wear protective clothing while using the medication.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Bexarotene may interact with certain medications, including some systemic or topical photosensitizing agents, and vitamins containing vitamin A. Consult with your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications.
*   **Vitamin A Intake:** Due to potential additive toxicities, patients should limit their additional vitamin A intake to no more than 15,000 units per day.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How is Bexarotene applied?** A:  Apply a sufficient amount of gel to cover the affected area with a generous layer, using a clean, dry finger. Let it dry before covering with clothing. Avoid contact with healthy skin and mucosal surfaces. Avoid occlusive dressings.

*   **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The time to see a response varies, but improvement is usually observed when the medication is applied two to four times daily.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Apply the medication as soon as you remember. However, if it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule.  Don't double the dose.

*   **Q: How should Bexarotene be stored?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Follow the instructions on the medication label.

*   **Q: Can I use other topical medications with Bexarotene?** A:  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist before using other topical medications concurrently with Bexarotene to avoid potential interactions.

*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects, especially severe ones.
