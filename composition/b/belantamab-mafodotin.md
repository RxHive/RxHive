# Belantamab Mafodotin
### Generic Name
Belantamab Mafodotin

### Usage
Belantamab Mafodotin is a medication used to treat multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer affecting plasma cells in the bone marrow.  It's specifically indicated for adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.  This means it's used in patients whose disease has returned after treatment (relapsed) or hasn't responded to previous treatments (refractory).  The medication is typically used after at least four prior therapies, including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, a proteasome inhibitor, and an immunomodulatory agent.


### Dosage
The recommended dosage of Belantamab Mafodotin for adults with multiple myeloma is 2.5 mg/kg of actual body weight.  This is administered intravenously (IV) over approximately 30 minutes once every three weeks. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

**Important Considerations:**  Before each dose, and promptly if ocular symptoms worsen, ophthalmic examinations (visual acuity and slit-lamp) are crucial.  Baseline exams should be within three weeks before the first dose, with subsequent exams at least one week after the previous dose and within two weeks of the next. Patients should use preservative-free lubricant eye drops at least four times daily, starting with the initial infusion and continuing until treatment ends, and avoid contact lenses unless specifically advised otherwise.

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors like corneal adverse reactions (which are graded using the Keratopathy and Visual Acuity (KVA) scale, described in detail under "Dosage Adjustments" in the source material), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and infusion-related reactions. Specific guidelines for these adjustments are detailed below and should be followed closely under the care of a healthcare provider.  The safety and effectiveness of Belantamab Mafodotin in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For mild impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin 1 to ≤1.5 times ULN and any AST), no dosage adjustment is needed.  Dosage adjustments for moderate or severe hepatic impairment haven't been established.

* **Renal Impairment:** For eGFR 30–89 mL/min/1.73 m², no adjustment is needed.  Dosage adjustments for eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m², or end-stage renal disease, haven't been established.

* **Toxicity Management:** Dosage reductions or treatment interruption may be necessary for various adverse reactions. The specific guidelines depend on the severity of the reaction and are outlined in the source material's section on dosage adjustments based on the KVA scale for corneal reactions, thrombocytopenia and infusion related reactions.  Grade 4 reactions often necessitate treatment discontinuation.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of Belantamab Mafodotin include:

* Fatigue
* Decreased visual acuity
* Dry eye syndrome
* Corneal toxicity (ranging from mild superficial keratopathy to corneal ulceration)
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Decreased serum albumin, potassium, and sodium levels
* Increased gamma-glutamyl transferase and serum glucose levels
* Decreased hemoglobin, neutrophils, and platelets
* Increased serum alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase levels
* Arthralgia
* Asthenia
* Back pain
* Increased creatine phosphokinase
* Increased serum creatinine levels
* Fever
* Infusion-related reactions

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Pneumonia
* Vomiting
* Sepsis
* Keratitis
* Albuminuria
* Hypercalcemia
* Renal insufficiency
* Corneal ulcer
* Severe vision loss
* Pneumonitis
* Increased intraocular pressure
* Secondary cataract

If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Belantamab Mafodotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). It works by targeting a protein called B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) found on the surface of multiple myeloma cells. The antibody portion of the drug binds to BCMA, allowing the drug to enter the myeloma cells. Once inside, it releases a cytotoxic agent (MMAE, a microtubule inhibitor) which disrupts the microtubule network essential for cell division and survival, leading to cell death (apoptosis).  The drug can also work through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP), mechanisms by which the immune system helps eliminate the targeted cells.

### Precautions
* **Ocular Toxicity:**  Belantamab Mafodotin can cause serious eye problems, including corneal damage and vision loss. Regular eye exams are mandatory.
* **Thrombocytopenia:**  The drug can lower platelet counts, increasing the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring is necessary.
* **Infusion Reactions:** Infusion-related reactions can occur. Careful monitoring during infusion and appropriate management are essential.
* **Embryo-Fetal Toxicity:**  Belantamab Mafodotin can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and after treatment.  Men should also consider using contraception.
* **Fertility:**  The drug may impair fertility in both men and women.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be needed in individuals with hepatic or renal impairment.  However, specific adjustments for all levels of impairment have not been established.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Interactions with other medications are possible.  Discuss all medications with your doctor before starting Belantamab Mafodotin therapy.  Consult the source material for a detailed list of drug interactions.

### FAQs
* **How is Belantamab Mafodotin administered?** It is given intravenously (IV) over about 30 minutes.

* **How long does treatment last?** Treatment continues until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Consult your doctor immediately to reschedule the dose.

* **How should Belantamab Mafodotin be stored?** Store according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Usually refrigeration is required.  The diluted solution must be infused within 6 hours of removal from refrigeration.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Report all side effects to your doctor promptly.  Some side effects may require dosage adjustments or treatment discontinuation.

* **Is Belantamab Mafodotin safe for pregnant women?** No, it can cause fetal harm.  Pregnancy should be avoided during and for some time after treatment.
