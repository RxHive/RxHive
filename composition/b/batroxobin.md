# Batroxobin
### Generic Name
Batroxobin

### Usage
Batroxobin is a thrombin-like enzyme derived from the venom of certain species of lancehead snakes ( *Bothrops moojeni* and *Bothrops atrox*).  Its primary use is in the treatment of vascular thrombosis, specifically conditions where blood clots form within blood vessels.  The specific type of Batroxobin used and its intended effect may vary depending on the source snake venom. Batroxobin from *Bothrops moojeni* acts as a defibrinogenating agent, breaking down fibrinogen (a clotting factor), while Batroxobin from *Bothrops atrox* has primarily hemostatic properties (promoting blood clotting).  Therefore, its precise application is determined by the specific formulation and clinical context.

### Dosage
Batroxobin is typically administered intravenously (IV).  Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific clinical indication and the patient's response.  One unit (BU) of Batroxobin is defined as the amount needed to coagulate 0.3 mL of citrated human plasma in 19 seconds.

**Adult Dosage (Vascular Thrombosis):**  The usual intravenous dose is 10 BU dissolved in 100 mL of normal saline and administered over one hour.  This may be given as a single dose or repeated every 24 or 48 hours, for up to four weeks, depending on the clinical response. Doses from 5 to 30 BU per day have been reported.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Batroxobin is contraindicated in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic or renal impairment; however, Batroxobin is contraindicated in those with severe impairment of either organ.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Angina (chest pain)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Urticaria (hives)
* Skin rash
* Increased levels of liver aminotransferases (liver enzymes)
* Hematuria (blood in urine)
* Ecchymosis (bruising)
* Epistaxis (nosebleed)
* Ulorrhagia (bleeding from the gums)
* Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
* Hemorrhage (bleeding)


More serious, though less frequent, side effects are possible.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Batroxobin's mechanism of action depends on the source and preparation.  In general, it acts similarly to thrombin, converting fibrinogen to fibrin, a key component of blood clots. However, unlike thrombin, Batroxobin primarily cleaves only one of the two peptide bonds in fibrinogen. This leads to the formation of less stable, non-cross-linked fibrin clots that are more easily broken down by the body's natural clot-dissolving mechanisms.  This property makes it useful in reducing the effects of existing clots (in the case of *Bothrops moojeni* derived Batroxobin) while maintaining its hemostatic effect.  The reduction in plasma fibrinogen leads to a significant decrease in blood and plasma viscosity.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Batroxobin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity, active hemorrhage, recent major surgery, current peptic ulcers (gastric or duodenal), severe hepatic or renal impairment, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and pediatric patients.
* **Increased Risk of Hemorrhage:** Batroxobin increases the risk of bleeding.  Use caution in patients with a history of bleeding disorders or those on anticoagulant or antithrombotic medications.
* **Other Precautions:**  Use caution in patients with a history of peptic ulcers, cerebrovascular accident (stroke), and in elderly patients.

### FAQs
