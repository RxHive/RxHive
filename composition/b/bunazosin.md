# Bunazosin
### Generic Name
Bunazosin

### Usage
Bunazosin is primarily used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure).  It works by relaxing blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure.  It's not typically used for other conditions.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Essential Hypertension:** The starting dose is usually 6 mg once daily (OD). This can be adjusted based on individual response and can range from 3 to 12 mg per day.  The doctor will likely start with a lower dose and gradually increase it as needed.  Elderly patients usually begin with a lower dose of 3 mg/day. Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with liver or kidney problems.

* **Administration:** Bunazosin is typically administered orally as a tablet. Tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed or chewed. To minimize the risk of dizziness (first-dose phenomenon), the initial dose is often taken at bedtime.


**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of bunazosin in children have not been established, therefore its use is contraindicated in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Patients with liver problems usually start with 3 mg/day due to higher plasma concentrations of the drug in this group.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) between 30 and 60 mL/min, the starting dose is 3 mg/day. Bunazosin is contraindicated in those with CrCl below 30 mL/min.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Malaise (general feeling of discomfort)
* Insomnia
* Palpitations
* Postural hypotension (a drop in blood pressure when standing up)
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Constipation

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Syncope (fainting)
* Severe hypotension
* Increased liver enzyme levels (AST and ALT)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as potentially serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Bunazosin is a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist. This means it blocks the action of alpha-1 receptors in the blood vessels. By blocking these receptors, bunazosin causes the blood vessels to relax and widen (vasodilation), resulting in decreased blood pressure. It primarily affects blood vessels, and has minimal effect on the heart.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Bunazosin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to bunazosin or related drugs, severe coronary insufficiency, severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min), and children.

* **Interactions:** Bunazosin's effects can be enhanced by diuretics and other antihypertensive medications. The combination may necessitate a dose reduction.  Rifampicin can decrease bunazosin's blood concentration.  The use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (like sildenafil) concurrently can increase the hypotensive effect.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Bunazosin should be avoided during pregnancy unless the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks. It's unknown whether it's excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment.

* **General Precautions:** Patients should be aware of the possibility of postural hypotension, especially after the initial dose or dose increases. They should rise slowly from a sitting or lying position to minimize dizziness or fainting.  Patients should avoid activities requiring alertness (driving, operating machinery) until they know how bunazosin affects them.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking bunazosin?** A:  It's best to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while on bunazosin, as alcohol can also lower blood pressure, potentially increasing the risk of hypotension.

* **Q: How should I store bunazosin?** A: Store bunazosin at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking bunazosin suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop taking bunazosin suddenly.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Always consult your doctor before stopping this medication.

* **Q:  What if I experience dizziness?** A: Dizziness is a common side effect. If it is severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider.
