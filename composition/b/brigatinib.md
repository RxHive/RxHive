# Brigatinib
### Generic Name
Brigatinib

### Usage

Brigatinib is primarily used to treat adult patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK).  This means the cancer cells have a specific abnormality (ALK-positive) that makes them susceptible to this targeted therapy.  The FDA approval of Brigatinib is contingent upon confirmation of ALK positivity using an FDA-approved test.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC):**

Brigatinib is administered orally. The initial dose is 90 mg once daily (OD) for seven days.  If this is well-tolerated, the dose is increased to 180 mg OD. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.

If treatment is interrupted for 14 days or more due to reasons other than adverse reactions, it should be restarted at 90 mg OD for seven days before escalating back to the previously tolerated dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For mild to moderate impairment (Child-Pugh A or B), no dose adjustment is needed. For severe impairment (Child-Pugh C), reduce the dose by approximately 40%.

* **Renal Impairment:** For creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30-89 mL/min, no dose adjustment is necessary. For CrCl of 15-29 mL/min, reduce the dose by approximately 50%.

* **Toxicity Management:** Dose reductions are made based on the severity of adverse reactions.  Specific guidelines exist for managing hypertension, bradycardia, elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), hyperglycemia, elevated lipase/amylase, and ocular or pulmonary toxicity.  Refer to the complete prescribing information for detailed instructions.  If a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor is co-administered, dose adjustments are needed.  Likewise, adjustments are necessary if a moderate CYP3A inducer is given concurrently.  See prescribing information for details.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and effectiveness of Brigatinib in pediatric patients have not been established.

### How it Works

Brigatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by blocking the activity of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) enzyme.  ALK is abnormally active in certain types of cancer cells, driving their growth and spread. By inhibiting ALK, Brigatinib interferes with the cancer cell's ability to grow and divide, leading to tumor shrinkage or stabilization. Brigatinib also inhibits other kinases (ROS1, IGF-1R, and FLT3), potentially contributing to its anti-cancer effects.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Brigatinib is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or its components.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Brigatinib's metabolism can be affected by certain drugs, particularly those that inhibit or induce CYP3A enzymes (involved in drug metabolism).  These interactions can lead to increased or decreased Brigatinib levels, potentially impacting its effectiveness or causing increased side effects. Consult a healthcare professional about potential drug interactions before starting Brigatinib.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Brigatinib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of reproductive potential should use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment and for at least four months after the last dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for one week after the final dose.

* **Other Precautions:** Patients with pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, bradycardia, or impaired liver or kidney function require close monitoring.  Regular monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and liver and kidney function tests is crucial.  Ophthalmologic evaluation is also recommended for patients experiencing visual disturbances.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Brigatinib with food?** A: Yes, Brigatinib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take an extra dose; just take the next dose at the scheduled time.

* **Q: How should I store Brigatinib?** A: Store Brigatinib as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Brigatinib?** A: No, avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice as they can increase Brigatinib levels in the blood.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects to your healthcare provider immediately. Some side effects may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of the medication.
