# Bacitracin + Neomycin + Polymyxin B

**Generic Name:** Bacitracin + Neomycin + Polymyxin B (often abbreviated as BPN)

**Usage:** This triple antibiotic ointment is a topical treatment used to prevent infection in minor cuts, scrapes, burns, and abrasions.  It's primarily used for the prevention of infection, not the treatment of existing, established infections.  It is generally considered a first-aid topical treatment and should not be used for deep wounds, serious burns, or puncture wounds.  Always consult a doctor for deeper wounds or infections.

**Side Effects:** While generally safe for topical use, side effects can occur, though they are typically mild. These may include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  This is the most common and serious potential side effect. Symptoms can range from mild itching and rash to severe swelling, difficulty breathing, and anaphylaxis.  Stop use immediately and seek medical attention if you experience an allergic reaction.
* **Irritation:**  Burning, stinging, redness, and swelling at the application site are possible.
* **Skin sensitization:**  Repeated use can lead to increased sensitivity to the antibiotics.
* **Secondary infection:**  In rare instances, prolonged or improper use can lead to the growth of resistant bacteria.


**How it Works:** Bacitracin, neomycin, and polymyxin B are all antibiotics that work in different ways to kill or inhibit the growth of a broad range of bacteria commonly causing skin infections.  Bacitracin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis. Neomycin inhibits protein synthesis in bacteria. Polymyxin B disrupts bacterial cell membranes.  The combination provides broader coverage against various bacterial species.
