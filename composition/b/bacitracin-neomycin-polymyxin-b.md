# Bacitracin + Neomycin + Polymyxin B
### Generic Name
Bacitracin + Neomycin + Polymyxin B

### Usage

This combination of antibiotics is a topical ointment or cream used to treat a variety of bacterial skin infections.  It's primarily used for minor cuts, scrapes, burns (minor), and other skin wounds that are infected or at risk of becoming infected.  The three antibiotics work synergistically, meaning they're more effective together than individually, to combat a broad range of bacteria commonly causing skin infections.  While effective against many common culprits, it's crucial to remember that this is a topical treatment and isn't suitable for treating systemic bacterial infections (infections that have spread beyond the skin).

### Dosage

This medication is for external use only.  Apply a thin layer to the affected area two to three times daily.  The exact amount will depend on the size of the affected area, but a small amount is generally sufficient.  Avoid over-application as this won't improve results and may lead to increased side effects.  There are no specific pediatric or adult dosage differences; however, avoid application to large surface areas, particularly in children.

**For all forms (ointment and cream):**  Only apply to the affected skin area. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes (mouth, nose, etc.).  Wash hands thoroughly before and after application.  

**IV Administration:** This medication is not available for intravenous (IV) administration.  It's strictly for topical use only.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Itching
* Redness
* Swelling
* Skin rash

Less common, but more serious, side effects are rare but warrant immediate medical attention:

* Allergic reactions (including hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, difficulty breathing)
* Severe skin reactions (such as blistering, peeling)
* Signs of systemic absorption (rare but potentially serious) such as nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  This suggests the antibiotic has entered the bloodstream.

**If any adverse effects occur, discontinue use and consult a doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

Bacitracin, neomycin, and polymyxin B are all antibiotics that work in different ways to kill bacteria. Bacitracin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, preventing bacteria from building and repairing their cell walls, leading to cell death. Neomycin interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, preventing bacteria from producing essential proteins for survival. Polymyxin B disrupts the bacterial cell membrane, causing leakage of cellular contents and subsequent cell death.  This three-pronged approach makes the combination highly effective against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria frequently associated with skin infections.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Do not use this medication if you are allergic to bacitracin, neomycin, polymyxin B, or any other components of the product.  Prior history of allergy to any aminoglycoside (a class of antibiotics that includes neomycin) is a contraindication.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be under the guidance of a doctor. The benefits must outweigh any potential risks to the mother or child.
* **Wounds:** Avoid using on deep or serious wounds. This medication is for superficial skin infections only.
* **Other medications:** Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, as there may be interactions, though topical interactions are less frequent than systemic drug interactions.
* **Ear infections:** Not suitable for ear infections without specific direction from your doctor.

This medication is for external use only and should not be ingested or applied to large areas of the body. Keep out of reach of children.

### FAQs

**Q: How long should I use this medication?**

A: Continue using the ointment or cream as directed by your doctor or as indicated on the label, usually until the infection is completely cleared and the skin is healed. Do not stop prematurely, even if the infection appears to be improving.

**Q: Can I use this on my face?**

A: It's generally not recommended for use on the face, especially around the eyes and mouth, due to the risk of irritation or allergic reactions. Always consult your doctor before using on sensitive areas.

**Q: What should I do if I accidentally get it in my eyes?**

A: Flush your eyes immediately with plenty of clean water for at least 15 minutes.  Seek medical attention if irritation persists.

**Q: How should I store this medication?**

A: Store at room temperature away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: Can I use this ointment on open wounds?**

A: For deep or extensively damaged skin, consult your physician to determine appropriate treatment.   This triple antibiotic ointment is suitable for minor scrapes, abrasions, and burns.
