# Bemiparin
### Generic Name
Bemiparin

### Usage
Bemiparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulant medication. Its primary use is in the acute treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a serious condition involving blood clots in the deep veins of the legs.  It's also used for several prophylactic purposes: preventing blood clots from forming in the extracorporeal circuit during hemodialysis (kidney dialysis), preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE – blood clots in the veins that can travel to the lungs) in non-surgical patients at risk, and preventing recurrent VTE.  Furthermore, it plays a role in post-operative thromboprophylaxis, reducing the risk of blood clots after surgery, particularly in patients undergoing general or orthopedic procedures.

### Dosage

Bemiparin dosage is measured in anti-Xa international units and varies significantly depending on the specific use and patient characteristics.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  Here's a summary, but this is *not* a substitute for professional medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Treatment:** Typically, 115 units/kg subcutaneously (SC) once daily. Alternative weight-based dosing using pre-filled syringes is also available, ranging from 5000 units to 10000 units daily depending on weight; patients over 100kg will again require dosing based on weight (115 units/kg).  Oral anticoagulation is usually started 3-5 days after initiating Bemiparin.

* **Postoperative Thromboprophylaxis (General Surgery, Moderate Risk):**  An initial dose of 2500 units SC 2 hours before or 6 hours after surgery, followed by 2500 units daily for 7-10 days.

* **Postoperative Thromboprophylaxis (Orthopedic Surgery, High Risk):** An initial dose of 3500 units SC 2 hours before or 6 hours after surgery, followed by 3500 units daily for 7-10 days.

* **Hemodialysis (Preventing Clotting):**  2500 units (under 60kg) or 3500 units (over 60kg) into the arterial line at the start of each dialysis session (for sessions ≤ 4 hours).

* **VTE Prevention (Non-surgical Patients):** 2500 or 3500 units SC daily until the risk diminishes or the patient is fully mobile.

* **Recurrent VTE Prevention:** 3500 units SC daily for up to 3 months.


**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of bemiparin in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage may need adjustment in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Consult your doctor for specific guidelines.  Reduced dosage may be necessary in patients with impaired renal function (CrCl <30 mL/min) to avoid accumulation.  Use is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

**Administration:** Subcutaneous injections should be given deep into the anterolateral or posterolateral abdominal wall, alternating sides.  For hemodialysis, administration is directly into the arterial line.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Bruising, hematoma, and pain at the injection site.
* **1-10%:** Bleeding (skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, etc.), increased serum transaminases (liver enzymes) or gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (usually mild and transient).
* **Less Common (but Serious):** Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), epidural or spinal hematoma, tissue necrosis at the injection site, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels).

Any unusual bleeding or allergic reactions warrant immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Bemiparin is a LMWH that inhibits the activity of factor Xa and, to a lesser extent, factor IIa (thrombin), both crucial components in the blood clotting cascade. By selectively inhibiting these factors, bemiparin reduces the formation of blood clots, thereby preventing or treating thromboembolic events.  It's important to note that the anti-factor Xa activity is significantly higher than its anti-factor IIa activity, a key characteristic of LMWHs.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to bemiparin or other heparins, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), active bleeding, severe hepatic or renal impairment, certain recent surgeries (brain, spine, eyes, ears),  active peptic ulcer, hemorrhagic stroke, or conditions with a high risk of bleeding.  Use is also contraindicated with spinal/epidural anesthesia requiring treatment doses of bemiparin.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients taking bemiparin have an increased risk of bleeding, hyperkalemia, thrombocytopenia, and cutaneous necrosis.
* **Interactions:**  Bemiparin can interact with numerous medications, including other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and certain herbs.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Bemiparin's safety during pregnancy is unknown, and breastfeeding is not recommended.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for bemiparin to work?**  A: The onset of action varies depending on the indication, but effects are usually seen relatively quickly.

* **Q: How should I store bemiparin?**  A: Store as directed by your pharmacist. Usually this involves refrigeration.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for guidance.  Never double up on a dose.

* **Q: Are there any foods or drinks I should avoid while taking bemiparin?** A:  No specific dietary restrictions are typically associated with bemiparin, but consult your doctor if you have concerns.
