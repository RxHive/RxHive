# Bevantolol
### Generic Name
Bevantolol

### Usage
Bevantolol is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It works by blocking the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) on the heart, leading to a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. While its primary use is in hypertension management, Bevantolol may also be considered in certain clinical scenarios, but this should only be determined by a physician.  It is crucial to remember that this medication should only be used under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional and not for self-treatment.

### Dosage
Dosage for Bevantolol varies depending on individual needs and response to treatment.  A physician will determine the appropriate dose.

**Adults (Hypertension):** The typical oral dose is 200-400 mg per day, divided into two doses.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Bevantolol in children have not been established, so it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Patients with liver cirrhosis, particularly older adults, may require a 50-75% reduction in the daily dose.
* **Renal Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for patients with kidney problems. However, renal function should be closely monitored.  A physician's guidance is essential.


### Side Effects
Bevantolol, like many medications, can cause side effects.  While not everyone experiences them, it's important to be aware of the possibilities.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Fatigue
* Drowsiness
* Insomnia
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Cold extremities

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Heart failure
* Bronchospasm (wheezing, shortness of breath)
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis â€“ a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Worsening of existing conditions such as peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, or hyperthyroidism

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.  Your doctor can assess the severity and advise on the best course of action.

### How it Works
Bevantolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. This means it primarily affects beta-1 receptors located in the heart.  By blocking these receptors, it prevents adrenaline and noradrenaline from increasing heart rate and the force of heart contractions. This leads to a reduction in blood pressure.  Bevantolol also possesses weak vasodilating properties, meaning it can help relax blood vessels, further contributing to lower blood pressure.  It lacks significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), meaning it doesn't stimulate the heart like some other beta-blockers.

### Precautions
Several precautions should be considered before starting or continuing Bevantolol treatment:

* **Contraindications:** Bevantolol is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, cardiogenic shock, overt cardiac failure, second- or third-degree AV block, and severe sinus bradycardia.
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution in patients undergoing anesthesia or surgery, those with bronchospastic diseases (e.g., asthma, COPD), cerebrovascular insufficiency, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal disease, hyperthyroidism, myasthenic conditions, or peripheral vascular disease.
* **Drug Interactions:** Bevantolol can interact with other medications, such as digoxin, calcium channel blockers, and certain other cardiovascular drugs.  Inform your physician of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Bevantolol during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Bevantolol to work?**  A:  The time it takes to notice a therapeutic effect can vary, but it often takes several weeks for blood pressure to be effectively controlled.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Bevantolol suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping Bevantolol can lead to rebound hypertension and other complications. Always consult your physician before making any changes to your medication regimen.  They will usually recommend a gradual tapering off of the medication.

* **Q: How should I store Bevantolol?** A: Store Bevantolol as directed by your pharmacist or physician, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.
