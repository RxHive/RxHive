# Botulism Immunoglobulin (IV Human)
### Generic Name
Botulism Immunoglobulin (IV Human)

### Usage
Botulism immunoglobulin (IV human) is a medication used to treat infant botulism, a serious illness caused by toxins produced by *Clostridium botulinum* bacteria.  This treatment is specifically indicated for infants under one year of age who have been diagnosed with botulism caused by toxin types A or B. It's crucial to understand that this medication is *not* used to treat botulism in adults.

### Dosage

**Infant Botulism:**

*   The recommended dose is 50 mg/kg given as a single intravenous (IV) infusion.
*   The infusion should begin as soon as the diagnosis of infant botulism is confirmed.
*   The initial infusion rate is 25 mg/kg/hour (0.5 mL/kg/hour) for the first 15 minutes.  If this is well-tolerated, the rate may be increased to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/hour (1 mL/kg/hour).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment. The infusion rate and concentration should be minimized in these individuals to reduce the risk of adverse effects.

**Adults:** Botulism immunoglobulin (IV human) is not indicated for use in adults.

*   Fever


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

*   Agitation
*   Neurologic abnormalities (e.g., neurogenic bladder)
*   Cold extremities
*   Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
*   Dehydration
*   Hyponatremia (low sodium levels)
*   Metabolic acidosis
*   Oral candidiasis (thrush)
*   Decreased hemoglobin or anemia
*   Injection site reaction (erythema)
*   Abnormal breath sounds
*   Stridor (high-pitched breathing sound)
*   Lower respiratory tract infection
*   Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
*   Tachypnea (rapid breathing)
*   Infusion-related reactions (back pain, chills, fever, muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, wheezing)


### How it Works

Botulism immunoglobulin (IV human) is a preparation of antibodies derived from the plasma of adults immunized against botulinum toxins types A and B. These antibodies bind to and neutralize the circulating botulinum toxins in the infant's bloodstream, preventing further damage and allowing the body to recover.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to human immune globulin preparations or any of its components, or those with selective IgA deficiency.
*   **Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), aseptic meningitis syndrome, hemolytic anemia, hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity, hyponatremia, pulmonary edema, acute renal dysfunction, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), and thrombotic events.
*   **Interactions:**  Concomitant use with live vaccines should be avoided, as immune globulins may diminish their effectiveness.
*   **Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency or those at increased risk of developing it.
*   **Infusion:**  The medication must be administered intravenously; intramuscular or subcutaneous administration is not permitted.  The infusion rate should be carefully monitored, and the infusion should be slowed or stopped if adverse reactions occur.  Close monitoring for adverse reactions is crucial throughout the infusion.
*   **Infectious Agents:** Although rigorous donor screening and testing minimize the risk, there is always a potential for transmission of infectious agents present in human plasma.
