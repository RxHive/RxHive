# Bortezomib

**Generic Name:** Bortezomib

**Usage:** Bortezomib is a prescription drug used to treat certain types of cancer, including:

* **Multiple myeloma:**  A cancer of plasma cells in the bone marrow.  It's often used in combination with other drugs.
* **Mantle cell lymphoma:** A type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.


**Side Effects:**  Bortezomib can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:**  Fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, numbness or tingling in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy), low blood counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), dizziness, cough.
* **Serious side effects:**  Severe peripheral neuropathy (potentially leading to permanent nerve damage), heart problems (cardiomyopathy), serious infections (due to low blood counts), kidney problems,  fluid retention (edema),  tumour lysis syndrome (a rapid breakdown of cancer cells that can cause kidney problems),  and allergic reactions.


**How it Works:** Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor.  Proteasomes are protein complexes within cells that break down other proteins.  By inhibiting the proteasome, bortezomib prevents the breakdown of certain proteins that are important for cancer cell growth and survival. This leads to the accumulation of these proteins within cancer cells, ultimately causing their death.
