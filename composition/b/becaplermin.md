# Becaplermin
### Generic Name
Becaplermin

### Usage
Becaplermin is a topical gel used as an adjunctive therapy for treating lower extremity diabetic neuropathic ulcers.  These are ulcers that extend into, or beyond, the subcutaneous tissue and have sufficient blood supply. It's important to note that Becaplermin is used *in addition* to standard wound care practices, not as a replacement.  It's not indicated for all types of wounds.


### Dosage
Becaplermin gel is for topical use only.  The amount applied depends on the size of the ulcer.  The dosage calculation isn't a fixed amount but is based on the surface area of the ulcer:

* **For ulcers measured in centimeters:** (Ulcer length in cm x Ulcer width in cm) / 4 = Length of gel needed in cm. This calculation assumes a 15g tube of gel.
* **For ulcers measured in inches:** (Ulcer length in inches x Ulcer width in inches) x 0.6 = Length of gel needed in inches.  This calculation also assumes a 15g tube of gel.

Apply the calculated amount once daily (OD) using a cotton swab, tongue depressor, or similar tool.  Spread the gel thinly and evenly over the entire ulcer surface.  The gel should be applied as a continuous layer, roughly 1/16th of an inch thick.  The application site should be covered with a saline-moistened dressing for approximately 12 hours. After 12 hours, remove the dressing, rinse the area with saline or water to remove any remaining Becaplermin gel, and then cover the area with a fresh, saline-moistened dressing (without additional Becaplermin gel) for the remainder of the day.

Dosage recalculation should be performed every 1-2 weeks based on the observed changes in ulcer size. If the ulcer doesn't show at least a 30% reduction in size after 10 weeks of treatment, or if complete healing isn't achieved within 20 weeks, the continued use of Becaplermin should be reevaluated with a healthcare professional.

**Pediatric Use:**  The dosage for adolescents 16 years and older is the same as for adults.  Becaplermin is not typically used in younger children.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):

* Erythema (redness)
* Skin rash

Less common, but potentially serious side effects (occurring in <1% of patients):

* Ulcer infection
* Tunneling of the ulcer
* Skin ulceration
* Local pain

If any adverse effects occur, seek medical advice immediately.


### How it Works
Becaplermin is a recombinant form of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rPDGF-BB).  PDGF-BB is a naturally occurring protein that plays a crucial role in wound healing.  Becaplermin works by promoting the formation of new granulation tissue (the foundation for new skin), stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts (cells that produce collagen, a key component of skin), and encouraging angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels). These actions collectively contribute to faster wound healing.


### Precautions
* **Contraindication:** Becaplermin is contraindicated in patients with known neoplasms (tumors) at the application site.
* **Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of skin sensitization or irritation, and there's a theoretical risk of malignancy.  Close monitoring is essential.
* **General Precautions:** Becaplermin is for topical use only; it should not be ingested, used in the eyes, or intravaginally.  Always follow the provided application instructions precisely.  
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Becaplermin is classified as Category C during pregnancy.  The safety during breastfeeding is unknown.  Use should be carefully considered, weighing potential benefits against potential risks.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are specifically recommended for patients with liver or kidney impairment due to the low systemic absorption of the drug. However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for any individual adjustments.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for Becaplermin to work?**
A:  The time it takes to see improvement varies, but significant improvement isn't typically expected before 10 weeks of treatment.  Complete healing may take up to 20 weeks.

**Q: Can I use Becaplermin with other wound care products?**
A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist. Using Becaplermin with other medications may affect wound healing or introduce unwanted interactions.  This should be carefully considered.

**Q: How should I store Becaplermin?**
A: Store the gel at room temperature, away from direct heat and sunlight.  Follow storage directions on the product label.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Apply the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it's nearly time for the next dose. Then just continue with your regular schedule. Donâ€™t apply a double dose to compensate for a missed one.

**Q: Can I stop using Becaplermin when the ulcer starts healing?**
A: No, continue using it as prescribed until the ulcer is completely healed. Premature discontinuation may hinder the healing process. Always consult your healthcare provider before stopping treatment.
