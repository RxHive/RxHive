# Boric Acid
### Generic Name
Boric Acid

### Usage
Boric acid is a weak topical anti-infective agent with multiple uses.  Its primary application is as a skin protectant, providing relief from the discomfort associated with minor skin irritations like chapped or chafed skin, diaper rash, dry skin, abrasions, sunburn, windburn, and insect bites.  It's also used to cleanse or irrigate the eyes, particularly in cases of mild inflammation.  Furthermore, boric acid finds application in the treatment of superficial fungal infections and acute otitis externa (swimmer's ear).  However, it's important to note that for fungal infections and swimmer's ear, it's often used in conjunction with other treatments and not as a standalone therapy.


### Dosage
Dosage varies considerably depending on the condition being treated and the form of boric acid used (ointment, solution, etc.).  Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider or the product labeling.

**Adults:**

* **Antisepsis (Topical):** Ointment (5%): Apply to the affected area three to four times daily.
* **Antisepsis (Ophthalmic):** Ointment (10%): Apply to the lower eyelid once or twice daily.
* **Superficial Fungal Infections (Topical):** Ointment (0.5-5%): Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice daily.  Do not self-treat athlete's foot, ringworm, or jock itch for more than 4 weeks (athlete's foot/ringworm) or 2 weeks (jock itch) without consulting a doctor.
* **Acute Otitis Externa (Otic):** Solution (2.75%): Instill 3-8 drops into each affected ear as directed by your physician.

**Children:**

Boric acid ointment is generally contraindicated in children under 2 years old. For children older than 2, the dosage is generally the same as for adults, but always consult a pediatrician before using boric acid on a child.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Irritation
* Burning or sticky sensation at application site
* Mild redness (erythema)
* In rare cases, more serious side effects, such as vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and central nervous system stimulation or depression may occur.  
* Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) are also possible.


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly if they are severe or persistent, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Boric acid possesses weak bacteriostatic (inhibits bacterial growth) and fungistatic (inhibits fungal growth) properties.  Its effectiveness varies depending on the concentration and the formulation it is used in. In ointment form, it shows greater bacteriostatic activity when combined with water-based bases compared to fatty bases. The precise mechanism by which it inhibits microbial growth isn't fully understood but is thought to involve disruption of cell membranes and interference with essential metabolic processes in microorganisms.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Boric acid is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to boric acid or any of its components. It is also contraindicated in children under 2 years of age.
* **Interactions:** Boric acid may increase the excretion of riboflavin (vitamin B2).  Concomitant use isn't recommended, but if it is necessary, it should be carefully monitored by a physician.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution when applying boric acid over large surface areas of the skin, for prolonged periods, in high concentrations, or on skin with compromised integrity (e.g., open wounds, severe burns).  Exercise particular caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and consult a doctor before using it.


### FAQs
* **Q: Is boric acid safe for ingestion?** A: No, boric acid is for external use only. Accidental ingestion can be toxic and requires immediate medical attention. Contact a poison control center immediately if ingested.

* **Q: How should I store boric acid?** A: Store boric acid as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I use boric acid for all types of skin infections?** A: No. Boric acid is effective against only some bacteria and fungi.  More severe infections require stronger medications prescribed by a doctor.

* **Q: How long should I use boric acid before seeing improvement?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the condition and its severity.  If you don't see improvement within a reasonable time or if the condition worsens, consult your healthcare provider.

* **Q: Can boric acid be used with other eye drops or ointments?** A:  Consult with your doctor or pharmacist to avoid potential interactions. Boric acid ointment should not be used with ophthalmic solutions containing polyvinyl alcohol.
