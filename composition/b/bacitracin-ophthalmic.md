# Bacitracin (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Bacitracin (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Bacitracin ophthalmic is an antibiotic ointment used to treat bacterial infections of the eye.  Its primary use is in treating superficial infections of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelid) and cornea (the clear front part of the eye). It's also used to treat blepharitis, an inflammation of the eyelids.  It's important to note that Bacitracin ophthalmic is not suitable for deep-seated eye infections or infections that might spread to other parts of the body.  If an infection is severe or doesn't improve with treatment, a doctor should be consulted.


### Dosage
**Adults:**

* **Blepharitis:** Apply a thin ribbon of Bacitracin ophthalmic ointment (500 units/g) to the affected eyelid margins twice daily and at bedtime.  If no improvement is seen after 10 days, further evaluation is necessary.
* **Superficial Conjunctival/Corneal Infections:** Apply a thin ribbon of Bacitracin ophthalmic ointment (500 units/g) to the affected eye every 3-4 hours for up to 10 days, depending on the severity of the infection. If no improvement is seen after 10 days, further evaluation is necessary.


**Children (Infants, Children, and Adolescents):**

* Apply 1/4 to 1/2 ribbon of Bacitracin ophthalmic ointment (500 units/g) every 3-4 hours or 8-12 hours for mild-to-moderate infections for 7-10 days.  Again, if no improvement is seen after 10 days, further evaluation is necessary.


**Important Administration Guidelines:**  The ointment should be applied as a thin ribbon into the conjunctival sac (the space between the eyelid and eyeball). Avoid touching the tip of the tube to the eye or surrounding skin to prevent contamination.  Excessive ointment should be avoided.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are rare but may include:

* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Contact dermatitis
* Blurred vision


If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Bacitracin is a polypeptide antibiotic.  It works by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, effectively stopping the growth and reproduction of bacteria causing the eye infection.  This mechanism prevents the bacteria from building the protective layers they need to survive.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Bacitracin ophthalmic is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to bacitracin or any component of the formulation, and in individuals with atopic conditions (like eczema).
* **Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known. However, always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, vitamins, or supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Bacitracin ophthalmic is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  This means that studies in animals have shown adverse effects, and there is no adequate data in humans.  Use during pregnancy should be considered only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, therefore caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:** Patients should be instructed on proper application techniques, avoiding contamination of the ointment. Patients should be aware that blurred vision may occur and should avoid tasks requiring clear vision until vision clears.  Contact lens wear should be discontinued during treatment.
