# Beraprost
### Generic Name
Beraprost

### Usage

Beraprost is a medication used to treat symptoms associated with peripheral circulatory disorders and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  In peripheral circulatory disorders like thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease), arteriosclerosis obliterans, and diabetic peripheral vascular disease, beraprost helps manage symptoms such as leg ulcers, pain, and the sensation of coldness in the extremities.  Its primary role in these conditions is to improve blood flow to the affected areas.  For PAH, a serious condition affecting the arteries in the lungs, beraprost helps to improve blood flow and reduce the strain on the heart.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the patient's individual response.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's specific instructions.

**Peripheral Circulatory Disorders (Oral):** The typical dose is 40 mcg three times daily (TID).

**Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) (Oral):**  Treatment usually starts with a lower dose of 20 mcg TID.  The doctor may gradually increase the dose, carefully monitoring the patient's response. The maximum daily dose is typically 180 mcg, divided into three or four doses.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment (serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL).  Always consult a doctor before adjusting the dose based on individual health factors.

### Side Effects

Beraprost, like many medications, can cause side effects.  The frequency and severity can vary from person to person.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Increased lactate dehydrogenase level

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Cardiovascular: Facial flushing, palpitations
* Dermatologic: Burning sensation of skin, skin rash
* Endocrine & Metabolic: Increased serum triglycerides, increased gamma-glutamyl transferase
* Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, anorexia, increased BUN, stomach discomfort
* Hematologic: Anemia, bruising, prolonged prothrombin time

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any concerning side effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Beraprost is a prostacyclin analog. Prostacyclin is a naturally occurring substance that helps relax blood vessels and prevent blood clots.  Beraprost works by binding to prostacyclin receptors in blood vessels and platelets. This binding increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, causing vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and inhibiting platelet aggregation (clumping). The resulting improved blood flow alleviates symptoms associated with peripheral circulatory disorders and PAH.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Beraprost is contraindicated in patients with active bleeding (e.g., gastrointestinal, urinary tract, hemoptysis), women who are or may become pregnant, and individuals with certain hereditary galactose metabolism disorders (depending on the formulation).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Beraprost is contraindicated in pregnancy. Women with PAH should avoid pregnancy.  It's unknown if beraprost is excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding is not recommended.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Beraprost can interact with other medications, particularly those that affect blood clotting (anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents) or blood pressure.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Other Precautions:** Use caution in patients with a risk of bleeding, severe renal impairment, or the elderly.  Monitor blood pressure, liver function, and kidney function regularly during treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking beraprost?** A:  Beraprost can cause dizziness. Avoid activities requiring alertness until you know how the medication affects you.
* **Q: How should I store beraprost?** A:  Store as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
