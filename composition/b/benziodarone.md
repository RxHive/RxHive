# Benziodarone
### Generic Name
Benziodarone

### Usage
Benziodarone is a uricosuric drug, meaning it increases the excretion of uric acid from the body.  Its primary use was in the treatment of hyperuricemia (high levels of uric acid in the blood) associated with chronic gout.  It was also used historically as a vasodilator (a drug that widens blood vessels), but this use is now obsolete.  It's important to note that benziodarone is no longer commercially available due to the risk of serious side effects.


### Dosage
Because benziodarone is no longer marketed, specific dosage information is unavailable through standard pharmaceutical channels.  Any historical dosage information should be considered obsolete and potentially unsafe due to the drug's withdrawal from the market.  Do not attempt to obtain or use benziodarone based on outdated information.

### Side Effects
Benziodarone's most significant side effect was jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), indicating liver damage. Other side effects were:

*   Jaundice (a serious side effect)
*   Thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism)
*   Other potential, but less well-documented, side effects.


**Important Note:**  Due to the risk of serious side effects, particularly jaundice and thyroid problems, benziodarone is no longer available. If you experience any adverse effects from any medication, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
The precise mechanism of action of benziodarone isn't fully understood, but like its chemical relative benzbromarone, it's believed to inhibit the reabsorption of uric acid in the kidneys.  This means that more uric acid is excreted in the urine, leading to lower uric acid levels in the blood.  This reduction in serum uric acid helps manage the symptoms of gout.


### Precautions
Because benziodarone is no longer available, specific precautions are irrelevant for current clinical practice.  However, its withdrawal highlights the importance of carefully considering the risk-benefit profile of any medication.  Always consult a healthcare professional before taking any medication, even those previously used for similar conditions.
