# Bremelanotide
### Generic Name
Bremelanotide

### Usage
Bremelanotide is a medication used to treat acquired, generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women.  HSDD is characterized by persistently low sexual desire that causes significant distress or interpersonal problems. It's crucial to understand that bremelanotide is *not* indicated for postmenopausal women, men, or to enhance sexual performance in general.  The low sexual desire must not be due to other underlying medical or psychiatric conditions, relationship issues, or the effects of other medications.

### Dosage
Bremelanotide is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) using an auto-injector.  The standard dose for adults is 1.75 mg injected into the abdomen or thigh at least 45 minutes before anticipated sexual activity.  No more than one dose should be taken within a 24-hour period, and more than eight doses per month are not recommended. Treatment should be discontinued if there's no improvement in symptoms after eight weeks of use.  Dosage adjustments for patients with mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment are generally not needed, but caution is advised for those with severe impairment.  Bremelanotide is not approved for use in children, and its safety and efficacy in pediatric populations haven't been established.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Headache
* Flushing
* Nausea
* Skin hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin)
* Injection site reactions

Less common, but still potentially significant side effects include:

* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Increased blood pressure
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Hot flashes
* Pain (various locations)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Bremelanotide is a melanocortin receptor (MCR) agonist.  This means it stimulates several types of MCRs in the body, most notably MC1R and MC4R.  While the exact way it improves HSDD isn't fully understood, it's believed to involve its action on these receptors in the central nervous system (CNS).  The stimulation of MC1R also explains the skin hyperpigmentation side effect, as this receptor is involved in melanin production.

### Precautions
Bremelanotide is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension) or known cardiovascular disease.  Caution is advised in patients with severe liver or kidney disease, as they may experience a higher incidence and severity of side effects.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception while using bremelanotide and discontinue use if pregnancy is suspected. The safety of bremelanotide during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established; consult your doctor for guidance.  Bremelanotide can interact with some other medications; inform your doctor of all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
