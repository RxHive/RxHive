# Bran
### Generic Name
Bran

### Usage
Bran is primarily used as a source of dietary fiber, acting as a bulk-forming laxative. Its main application is in managing gastrointestinal (GI) tract disorders, particularly constipation. This includes conditions like diverticular disease and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  Bran also plays a role in preventing colon diseases and gastric cancer.  Specific types of bran, such as rice bran, demonstrate potential benefits in managing hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol).  Additionally, bran is a common ingredient in various breakfast cereals.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the type of bran (wheat, rice, oat, etc.) and the specific condition being treated.  Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.

* **Constipation (Wheat Bran):**  Adults typically take 20-25 grams of wheat bran daily.
* **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) (Wheat Bran):**  Adults may take up to 30 grams of wheat bran daily for up to 12 weeks.
* **Hypertension (Wheat or Oat Bran):**  Combine 3-6 grams of wheat or oat bran with a low-cholesterol diet as recommended by a healthcare professional.
* **Hypercholesterolemia (Rice Bran):**  The dosage ranges from 12-84 grams of rice bran daily or 4.8 grams of rice bran oil daily.  Consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

**Important Note:**  Bran should always be taken with plenty of water or other fluids to prevent blockage.  Never take bran dry.


### Side Effects
The most common side effect of bran is flatulence (gas) and abdominal distension (bloating). These are often temporary and subside as the body adjusts.  More serious side effects are rare but include intestinal or esophageal obstruction, especially if bran is swallowed dry or without sufficient fluid.

### How it Works
Bran works primarily by adding bulk to the stool.  This increases stool size and weight, stimulating bowel movements and relieving constipation.  For conditions like hypercholesterolemia, certain types of bran (like rice bran) may contain compounds that help lower cholesterol levels by reducing absorption and increasing elimination from the body.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Bran is contraindicated in individuals with intestinal obstruction or undiagnosed abdominal symptoms.
* **Increased Risk:**  Swallowing bran dry significantly increases the risk of intestinal or esophageal obstruction.
* **Gluten Sensitivity:** Wheat bran should be avoided by individuals with gluten enteropathies or celiac disease.
* **Fluid Intake:**  Always consume sufficient fluids when taking bran.  Dehydration can exacerbate constipation and increase the risk of obstruction.
* **Interactions:** Bran can interact with certain medications.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While generally considered safe, pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using bran regularly.
