# Butenafine
### Generic Name
Butenafine

### Usage
Butenafine is an antifungal medication primarily used to treat various types of fungal skin infections (tinea infections).  These include:

* **Tinea pedis:** Athlete's foot, a fungal infection affecting the feet, particularly between the toes.
* **Tinea corporis:** Ringworm affecting the body, characterized by itchy, circular rashes.
* **Tinea cruris:** Jock itch, a fungal infection affecting the groin area.
* **Tinea versicolor:** A fungal infection causing discoloration of the skin, often appearing as lighter or darker patches.

Butenafine is applied topically (directly to the skin) and is not typically used to treat systemic fungal infections.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies depending on the type and severity of the infection and the formulation used (cream).

* **Tinea pedis:** Apply to affected areas twice daily (BID) for at least one week, or once daily (OD) for four weeks.  The application should cover the area between and around the toes.
* **Tinea corporis and tinea cruris:** Apply once daily (OD) to the affected areas for two weeks.
* **Tinea versicolor:** Apply once daily (OD) to the affected areas and surrounding skin for two weeks.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  For children 12 years of age and older, the dosage is the same as for adults. Butenafine is generally not recommended for use in children younger than 12 years old without specific guidance from a healthcare professional.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  This is likely due to the low systemic absorption of butenafine when applied topically. However, it's always best to consult a doctor if you have concerns regarding liver or kidney function.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting more than 1% of users) are generally mild and localized to the application site. These may include:

* Burning sensation
* Contact dermatitis
* Erythema (redness)
* Irritation
* Itching (pruritus)
* Stinging sensation


Less common, but potentially more serious side effects, are possible and warrant immediate medical attention.  These are not comprehensively listed in the provided information but may include allergic reactions.

**If any adverse effects occur, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.**

### How it Works

Butenafine is an allylamine antifungal.  It works by inhibiting the production of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.  By disrupting ergosterol synthesis, butenafine weakens the fungal cell membrane, ultimately leading to the death of the fungal cells and clearing the infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Butenafine should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to butenafine or any components of the formulation.

* **Increased Risk:**  Patients may experience an increased risk of skin irritation or hypersensitivity reactions.

* **Use with Caution:** Butenafine should be used cautiously in immunocompromised patients (those with weakened immune systems) and individuals with known sensitivity to other allylamine antifungals such as naftifine and terbinafine.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Butenafine is categorized as pregnancy Category C. This means that animal studies have shown adverse effects, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The use during pregnancy should be carefully considered and only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, use with caution while breastfeeding.


* **General Considerations:**  Butenafine is for external use only. Apply to clean, dry skin and avoid contact with eyes, mouth, nose, or other mucous membranes. Avoid the use of occlusive dressings unless directed by a physician.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for butenafine to work?**  A:  Improvement is usually seen within a week, but treatment should be completed as directed to prevent recurrence.

* **Q: Can I use butenafine on my face?**  A: It's generally not recommended for use on the face, unless specifically directed by a doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Apply the medication as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store butenafine?**  A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, and keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I use other creams or lotions with butenafine?** A:  It is best to check with a doctor or pharmacist before combining it with other topical treatments to avoid potential interactions or reduced effectiveness.
