# Bacillus Calmette-Guerin
### Generic Name
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)

### Usage
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is a vaccine primarily used to prevent tuberculosis (TB) disease, particularly in infants, children, and young adults in countries where TB is prevalent.  It's a live, attenuated (weakened) strain of *Mycobacterium bovis*, a bacterium related to the one that causes TB in humans (*Mycobacterium tuberculosis*). While its main use is preventative, BCG can also be used in the treatment of certain types of bladder cancer. In this context, it's administered directly into the bladder to stimulate an immune response against the cancerous cells.  It's important to note that the use of BCG for bladder cancer treatment is significantly different from its use as a preventative TB vaccine and requires careful medical supervision.

### Dosage
BCG dosage varies considerably depending on its intended use (TB prevention or bladder cancer treatment) and the patient's age and health status.  There's no standard "dosage" in the same way as with many oral medications.

* **For TB prevention:** The vaccine is typically administered as a single intradermal injection (under the skin), usually given to infants or young children. The specific dosage and injection site are determined by the healthcare provider, and the volume of the injection varies depending on factors like the manufacturer and the country's guidelines.

* **For bladder cancer treatment:** BCG is administered into the bladder via a catheter. The dosage and frequency of administration vary depending on the treatment protocol decided upon by the urologist, and are often given in cycles over several weeks.  This is a much more complex treatment regimen compared to the single vaccine dose for TB prevention.  

It's crucial to emphasize that BCG dosage should *only* be determined and administered by a qualified healthcare professional.  Self-administration is extremely dangerous and should never be attempted.


### Side Effects
Side effects vary depending on the route of administration and the individual's immune response.

**Common side effects (TB vaccination):**

* Local reaction at the injection site:  Redness, swelling, small pus-filled lump, and/or a small scar.  These are generally mild and temporary.
* Fever
* Malaise (general feeling of discomfort)
* Lymphadenitis (swollen lymph nodes) – this is more common in infants.

**Less common but more serious side effects (TB vaccination):**

* Severe allergic reactions (rare but potentially life-threatening)
* Disseminated BCG infection (spread of the bacteria throughout the body – extremely rare)

**Side effects (bladder cancer treatment):**

* Irritable bladder (frequency, urgency, burning)
* Fever
* Flu-like symptoms
* Hematuria (blood in the urine)


**Important Note:** If any unusual or concerning side effects occur after BCG administration, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
* **TB Prevention:**  The live, attenuated BCG bacteria stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies and T cells that specifically target *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.  This provides a degree of protection against developing active TB disease.  The level of protection varies significantly depending on several factors, including the strain of BCG used and the individual's immune system.

* **Bladder Cancer Treatment:**  BCG works by triggering an immune response directly within the bladder.  The bacteria, when instilled into the bladder, stimulate the immune system to attack the cancerous cells. The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it involves both direct cytotoxic effects (killing cancer cells) and immune-mediated responses.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** BCG should not be given to individuals with severely weakened immune systems (immunocompromised), those with certain skin conditions, or those with known allergies to BCG. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before receiving BCG.

* **Drug Interactions:** Although rare, BCG might interact with medications that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants).  It is imperative to inform all healthcare providers about all medications being taken.

* **Specific Warnings:**  Close monitoring is needed in individuals who are immunocompromised. Children receiving BCG for TB prevention require careful observation for any adverse effects.  Following the vaccination, the site should be kept clean and dry. Avoid rubbing or scratching the injection site.

* **Storage:** BCG must be stored according to manufacturer's instructions and typically requires refrigeration.


### FAQs

* **Q: How effective is the BCG vaccine?**  A: The effectiveness of BCG against TB varies greatly depending on factors such as the strain of BCG used, the population being vaccinated, and the route of administration. It is generally more effective at preventing serious forms of TB, like meningitis and miliary TB, compared to pulmonary TB.  Protection can wane over time.

* **Q:  Is the BCG vaccine safe?** A: The BCG vaccine is generally considered safe, but as with all vaccines, side effects can occur. Serious side effects are rare.

* **Q:  Can I get TB from the BCG vaccine?** A:  The BCG vaccine uses a weakened strain of bacteria, meaning it's extremely unlikely to cause TB disease.  Very rarely, a mild local reaction can occur, mimicking TB infection, but this is usually temporary and harmless.

* **Q: How long does it take for BCG to be effective?** A: For TB prevention, the immune response develops within several weeks.  For bladder cancer treatment, the therapeutic effects unfold over the course of the treatment regimen.

* **Q:  Can I get the BCG vaccine if I have other health problems?** A:  It depends on the specific health condition.  Always inform your doctor about any health conditions before receiving any vaccine.

* **Q:  How is BCG stored?** A:  BCG must be stored under strict refrigeration conditions, as specified by the manufacturer's instructions.  Improper storage can render the vaccine ineffective.
