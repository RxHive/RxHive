# Bacillus Calmette-Guerin

**Generic Name:** Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)

**Usage:**

* **Treatment of Bladder Cancer:** BCG is instilled directly into the bladder to treat non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).  It's used after transurethral resection of the tumor (TURBT) to reduce the risk of recurrence.
* **Treatment of Superficial Bladder Tumors:**  Similar to above, it helps prevent recurrence and progression of superficial bladder tumors.
* **Prevention of Tuberculosis (TB):**  BCG vaccination is widely used in many parts of the world to prevent TB, particularly in children.  Its efficacy varies depending on the strain used and the population. Note that BCG vaccination does *not* guarantee complete protection against TB.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects vary depending on the route of administration (bladder instillation vs. vaccination).

**Following Bladder Instillation:**

* **Urinary Tract Symptoms:**  These are common and usually mild, including frequency, urgency, burning during urination, and hematuria (blood in the urine).
* **Flu-like Symptoms:** Fever, chills, fatigue, and body aches.
* **Bladder Irritation:**  Pain or discomfort in the bladder.
* **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  These include granulomas (inflammation) in other organs, severe infections, and hypersensitivity reactions.

**Following Vaccination:**

* **Local Reaction at Injection Site:** Redness, swelling, and a small scar.
* **Regional Lymphadenitis:**  Swelling of the lymph nodes near the injection site.
* **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  Disseminated BCG infection (spread of the bacteria throughout the body), especially in immunocompromised individuals.


**How it Works:**

* **In Bladder Cancer Treatment:** BCG is a weakened form of the tuberculosis bacteria. When instilled into the bladder, it triggers an immune response that attacks and destroys the cancer cells. The exact mechanism is complex but involves both cell-mediated and humoral immunity.
* **In TB Vaccination:**  The weakened BCG bacteria stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies and T cells that can recognize and fight *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the bacteria that causes TB.  This provides some level of protection, though not always complete.

**FAQs:**

* **Is BCG a live vaccine/treatment?** Yes, it's a live, attenuated (weakened) strain of *Mycobacterium bovis*, a close relative of the tuberculosis bacterium.
* **Is BCG safe?**  Generally, BCG is considered safe, but it carries some risks, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.  The benefits must be weighed against the risks before administering it.
* **How effective is BCG in preventing TB?**  The effectiveness varies greatly depending on factors such as the strain of BCG, the population vaccinated, and the BCG vaccination strategy.  It doesn't provide complete protection.
* **How long does BCG treatment for bladder cancer last?**  Treatment typically involves multiple instillations over several weeks or months.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects from BCG?**  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience severe or unusual side effects.
