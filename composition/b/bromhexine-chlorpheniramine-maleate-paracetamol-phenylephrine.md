# Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine

**Generic Name:** Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and flu, particularly those involving upper respiratory tract infections.  It combines several active ingredients to address different aspects of these illnesses:

* **Bromhexine:** A mucolytic agent, meaning it helps to thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that helps to relieve runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes associated with allergies and colds.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that helps to relieve nasal congestion by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages.

This combination aims to provide comprehensive relief from cold and flu symptoms like cough, runny nose, congestion, sneezing, headache, and fever.  However, it does *not* treat the underlying infection itself.

**Side Effects:**  The side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a common side effect of both chlorpheniramine and phenylephrine.
* **Dry mouth:** A common side effect of antihistamines.
* **Nausea:**  Can be caused by any of the ingredients.
* **Headache:** While paracetamol is used to relieve headache, it can also cause headache as a side effect in some individuals.
* **Dizziness:**  Possibly due to the phenylephrine.
* **Insomnia:** Particularly if taken later in the day.
* **Constipation:** A possible side effect of some antihistamines.
* **Increased heart rate:** More likely with higher doses of phenylephrine.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as rash, swelling, difficulty breathing, or hives.

This is not an exhaustive list, and more serious side effects are possible, though less common.  Consult the patient information leaflet for a complete list.

**How it Works:**

* **Bromhexine:** Reduces the viscosity of mucus, facilitating its expectoration.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks histamine receptors, reducing the symptoms of allergic reactions and the common cold.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamus and reduces pain through unknown mechanisms, possibly by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.
* **Phenylephrine:** Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa, causing vasoconstriction and reducing nasal congestion.
