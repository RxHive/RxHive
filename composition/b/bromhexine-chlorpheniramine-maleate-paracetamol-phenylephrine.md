# Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine
### Generic Name: Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine

This combination drug typically isn't sold under a single generic name as it combines multiple active ingredients, each addressing different aspects of cold and flu symptoms.  Instead, you'll find it under various brand names, often tailored to specific regional markets.  The information below describes the individual components and their combined effects.


### Usage

This combination medication is commonly used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  Each ingredient targets specific symptoms:

* **Bromhexine:** Acts as an expectorant, helping to loosen and thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up. This helps relieve congestion in the chest.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  A first-generation antihistamine that reduces runny nose and sneezing, common allergic and cold symptoms.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  A pain reliever and fever reducer. It effectively addresses headaches, muscle aches, and fever often accompanying respiratory infections.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, providing relief from nasal congestion.


This four-part combination aims to provide comprehensive relief from multiple cold and flu symptoms simultaneously.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific brand, age, weight, and the severity of the symptoms.  **Always follow the instructions precisely as indicated on the product packaging or prescribed by a healthcare professional.**  There isn't a universally applicable dosage, as formulations differ greatly.  Information for adults and children will be found on the product labeling.  Oral administration is typical.  IV administration isn't applicable for this particular combination.  

**Crucially:** Never exceed the recommended dosage. Overdosing on paracetamol can cause serious liver damage.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:**  Chlorpheniramine is a known sedative.
* **Dry mouth:** A common side effect of antihistamines.
* **Nausea:**  Though less common, some individuals may experience nausea.
* **Headache:** In some cases, this can be paradoxical, worsening existing headaches.
* **Dizziness:** Particularly with higher doses or in sensitive individuals.
* **Constipation:**  A possible side effect of some formulations.


Less common, but more serious side effects, may include allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing).  Seek immediate medical attention if any severe allergic reaction occurs.


### How it Works

Each component works through a different mechanism:

* **Bromhexine:** Increases the production of watery mucus, thus thinning the thicker, more viscous mucus and making it easier to expel.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions, reducing symptoms like runny nose and sneezing.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Reduces fever by affecting areas in the brain that regulate temperature. It also reduces pain through a less understood mechanism, possibly involving inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.
* **Phenylephrine:** Acts as a sympathomimetic, stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction and reducing nasal swelling.


The combined effect of these four drugs aims to address the multifaceted symptoms of the common cold and flu.
