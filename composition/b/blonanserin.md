# Blonanserin
### Generic Name
Blonanserin

### Usage
Blonanserin is primarily used to treat schizophrenia, a chronic mental illness affecting a person's ability to think, feel, and behave clearly.  It helps manage the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there) and delusions (false beliefs), as well as negative symptoms like decreased motivation and social withdrawal.  While not its primary indication, it may also be considered for other psychotic disorders, but this should be determined by a healthcare professional on a case-by-case basis.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Schizophrenia):** Blonanserin is typically administered orally.  The starting dose is usually 4 mg twice daily (BID).  This dose can be gradually increased based on individual response and tolerance, with the usual maintenance dose ranging from 8 to 16 mg per day, divided into two doses. A once-daily dose may also be effective for some. The maximum recommended daily dose is 24 mg.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of blonanserin in children have not been established. It is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised when using blonanserin in patients with liver problems. Always consult a healthcare professional before adjusting the dose.

### How it Works
Blonanserin is an atypical antipsychotic that works by affecting the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain. It primarily blocks dopamine D2, D3, and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.  These neurotransmitters play a significant role in regulating mood, thought processes, and behavior. By influencing these receptors, blonanserin helps to reduce the symptoms associated with schizophrenia.  Its relatively higher affinity for D2 receptors compared to 5-HT2A receptors contributes to its atypical profile, potentially reducing the risk of some side effects associated with older antipsychotic medications.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Blonanserin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, those currently taking certain CNS depressants, and in individuals with certain metabolic disorders (galactose intolerance, etc.). It should also be avoided in comatose patients.
* **Drug Interactions:** Blonanserin can interact with many other medications, including some antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and other antipsychotics.  Consult your healthcare provider about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Blonanserin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk.  Use during the third trimester is especially concerning due to potential side effects in the newborn.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking blonanserin.
* **Specific Populations:** Caution is needed in patients with cardiovascular disease, liver or kidney impairment, epilepsy, diabetes, or those at risk of aspiration pneumonia. Older adults and individuals with Lewy body dementia or Parkinson's disease dementia may be at increased risk of side effects.
