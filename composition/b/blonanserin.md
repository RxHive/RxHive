# Blonanserin

**Generic Name:** Blonanserin

**Usage:** Blonanserin is an atypical antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.  It's also sometimes used off-label for other conditions, but this should only be done under the strict supervision of a physician.  The specific usage and dosage will vary depending on the individual and their condition.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, blonanserin can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency. Some common side effects include:

* **Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS):**  These include movement disorders such as Parkinsonism (rigidity, tremor, slow movement), akathisia (restlessness), dystonia (muscle spasms), and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements, often of the face and tongue).  These are more common with typical antipsychotics but can still occur with atypical ones like blonanserin.
* **Sedation:**  Feeling drowsy or sleepy.
* **Weight gain:**  Significant weight increase can occur.
* **Metabolic changes:**  Increased blood sugar levels and cholesterol levels.
* **Prolactin elevation:**  Increased levels of the hormone prolactin can lead to galactorrhea (breast milk production), menstrual irregularities, and sexual dysfunction.
* **Orthostatic hypotension:**  A sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing, potentially causing dizziness or fainting.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty with bowel movements.
* **Dry mouth:** Reduced saliva production.
* **Blurred vision:** Impaired vision.

This is not an exhaustive list, and more severe or rare side effects are possible.  It's crucial to report any concerning side effects to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Blonanserin is a dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. This means it blocks the action of dopamine and serotonin in the brain.  Dopamine and serotonin imbalances are thought to play a role in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. By blocking these receptors, blonanserin helps to reduce the positive symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations and delusions. The precise mechanism by which it achieves this is complex and not fully understood.  The serotonin antagonism is believed to contribute to a reduced risk of extrapyramidal symptoms compared to typical antipsychotics that primarily target dopamine.
