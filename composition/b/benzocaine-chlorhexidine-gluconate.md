# Benzocaine + Chlorhexidine Gluconate
### Generic Name
Benzocaine + Chlorhexidine Gluconate

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used as a topical anesthetic and antiseptic.  Benzocaine provides local anesthesia, meaning it numbs the area where it's applied, while chlorhexidine gluconate possesses antiseptic properties, killing bacteria and reducing the risk of infection.  This makes the combination particularly useful for treating minor mouth sores, cuts, and abrasions in the mouth and throat, providing both pain relief and infection prevention.  It's often found in products for treating oral thrush (candidiasis), minor mouth ulcers (canker sores), and sore throats.  While it is occasionally used for other minor skin wounds, it's not typically the first-line treatment for extensive or deep wounds.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific product formulation (e.g., mouthwash, spray, gel). Always follow the instructions provided on the product label.  There are no standardized dosages for children or adults as the application is topical, and the amount used depends on the size and location of the affected area.  For mouthwashes, a typical instruction might be to swish a small amount for a specified duration before spitting it out, while gels and sprays usually involve direct application to the affected area.  **Never exceed the recommended dosage.**  Never ingest this medication.

### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Burning or stinging sensation at the application site, temporary numbness, slight alteration of taste.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing).  Although rare, benzocaine can cause a serious blood condition called methemoglobinemia, especially in infants and young children.  Symptoms include bluish discoloration of the skin and lips.
* **If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, stop using the medication and seek immediate medical attention.**

### How it Works

Benzocaine works by blocking nerve signals, preventing pain sensations from reaching the brain. This produces a numbing effect at the application site.  Chlorhexidine gluconate disrupts the bacterial cell membrane, leading to bacterial cell death, thus preventing or reducing infection.  The combination of these two actions provides both pain relief and infection control.
