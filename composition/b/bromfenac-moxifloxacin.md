# Bromfenac + Moxifloxacin
### Generic Name

Bromfenac + Moxifloxacin (Combination not typically found as a single pre-mixed formulation)


**Note:**  It's crucial to understand that Bromfenac and Moxifloxacin are typically prescribed as *separate* medications.  While they might be used together in certain clinical situations under a doctor's direct supervision, they are not commonly found as a pre-mixed, single-dose combination product. This information details each drug individually and then briefly discusses potential combined use.


### Usage

**Bromfenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to reduce pain and inflammation in the eye, particularly after cataract surgery. It's applied topically as eye drops.

**Moxifloxacin:** This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria. It's used to treat various bacterial infections, including those of the respiratory tract (pneumonia, bronchitis), skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract. It's available in oral (tablet) and intravenous (IV) forms.


**Combined Use (under doctor's prescription):** In some cases, a doctor might prescribe both Bromfenac and Moxifloxacin together. This could occur if a patient is recovering from eye surgery and develops a bacterial infection, such as a post-operative infection.  The Bromfenac would address the post-surgical inflammation and pain while the Moxifloxacin would target the infection.  This would be a case of *concurrent* use, not a combined formulation.


### Dosage


**Bromfenac (Ophthalmic):** Dosage is typically one drop in the affected eye(s) several times a day, as directed by the ophthalmologist.  Specific frequency varies based on the individual's needs and the post-operative recovery.

**Moxifloxacin (Oral):** Dosage varies depending on the infection being treated. Adults typically receive a single daily dose, though the exact amount varies based on the specific infection.  Always follow the prescribing physician's instructions.

**Moxifloxacin (IV):** Dosage is determined based on the patient's condition and the type of infection.  It's always administered by a healthcare professional in a hospital or clinical setting.


**Children:**  Both Bromfenac and Moxifloxacin are typically not used in children, unless specifically prescribed and monitored by a specialist for a very specific indication.  Dosage in pediatric patients will vary significantly based on age, weight and severity.


### Side Effects


**Bromfenac (Common):**

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye
* Blurred vision
* Eye irritation


**Bromfenac (Less Common, but Serious):**  Allergic reactions (rare)

**Moxifloxacin (Common):**

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness


**Moxifloxacin (Less Common, but Serious):**

* Tendinitis or tendon rupture
* Peripheral neuropathy
* Liver problems
* Allergic reactions (including angioedema)
* QT prolongation (heart rhythm abnormality)


**Important:**  If you experience any adverse effects, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works


**Bromfenac:**  Inhibits the production of prostaglandins, inflammatory mediators that contribute to pain and swelling. This reduces inflammation and pain in the eye.

**Moxifloxacin:**  Interferes with bacterial DNA replication and repair, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.  This kills bacteria causing the infection.


### Precautions


**Bromfenac:**  Not to be used if allergic to Bromfenac or similar NSAIDs.  Contact lens use might be affected; follow physician's advice.


**Moxifloxacin:**  Not to be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones.  Use caution in patients with a history of seizures, heart conditions (especially QT prolongation), or liver problems.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding:  Consult a doctor before use.


**Combined Use Precautions:**  The risk of interactions between Bromfenac and Moxifloxacin is generally low, but always inform your physician of all medications you are taking.
