# Broxyquinoline
### Generic Name
Broxyquinoline (Dibromohydroxyquinoline)

### Usage
Broxyquinoline, often used in combination with brobenzoxaldine, was primarily indicated for the treatment of childhood diarrhea caused by intestinal parasites.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is **no longer available on the market** due to significant safety concerns.  Its use was largely restricted to specific situations and always under strict medical supervision.  Any past usage should be considered historical, and alternative, safer treatments are now readily available for diarrhea and parasitic infections.

### Dosage
Due to the discontinuation of Broxyquinoline, providing specific dosage information is not medically responsible.  Any past dosage regimens would have been determined by a physician based on the individual patient's age, weight, and the severity of their condition.  Information on past dosages should not be interpreted as a recommendation for current use.

### Side Effects
While Broxyquinoline is no longer available, it's important to acknowledge its known side effects, as understanding these helps illustrate the reason for its withdrawal.  Reported side effects included:

*   Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
*   Headache
*   Skin rash
*   **Serious and rare but potentially life-threatening effects:** Myelo-optic neuropathy (damage to the spinal cord and optic nerves), which can lead to vision loss and neurological problems.

**If you experienced any adverse effects from Broxyquinoline in the past, it is crucial to consult with your doctor.**

### How it Works
Broxyquinoline's mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but research suggests it works through multiple pathways.  It exhibits antiprotozoal and antifungal properties, potentially interfering with the metabolic processes of parasites.  It's also been shown to affect vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcription and has angiogenic effects, though the clinical significance of these properties in treating diarrhea remains unclear.  It's important to note that these mechanisms are not fully elucidated and the efficacy of these actions in treating the intended conditions is debatable.

### Precautions
Given the drug's withdrawal, detailed precautions are primarily relevant for historical context or understanding the risks that led to its removal from the market.  Crucially, **Broxyquinoline should not be used.**  The significant risk of myelo-optic neuropathy outweighs any potential benefits.  It's critical to emphasize that there are now safer and more effective treatments for intestinal parasitic infections and childhood diarrhea.

### FAQs
**Q: Where can I find Broxyquinoline?**

A:  Many safer and more effective treatments are available.  Consult your doctor or healthcare provider for appropriate recommendations.

**Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with past Broxyquinoline use?**

A: The most serious long-term effect is the potential development of myelo-optic neuropathy, which can lead to irreversible vision loss and neurological damage.  If you have concerns about past use, contact your healthcare provider.

**Q:  Is it safe to take leftover Broxyquinoline?**

A:  No, it is not safe.  Discard any leftover medication appropriately, following the instructions of your local waste disposal authority.  Do not attempt to self-medicate with outdated or discontinued drugs.
