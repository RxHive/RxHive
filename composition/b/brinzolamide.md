# Brinzolamide
### Generic Name
Brinzolamide

### Usage
Brinzolamide is primarily used to lower elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adults with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  It works by reducing the production of aqueous humor, the fluid in the eye that contributes to IOP. Lowering IOP helps prevent vision loss associated with these conditions.  While not a primary indication, it may play a supporting role in managing other eye conditions as part of a broader treatment plan, but this should always be under the direction of an ophthalmologist.

### Dosage
The typical dosage for adults with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension is one drop of 1% brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension in the affected eye(s) three times a day (TID).  There is no established safe and effective dosage for children. Dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment are not specified in the manufacturerâ€™s labeling, however, caution is advised. For patients with renal impairment, a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of at least 30 mL/min is required; brinzolamide is contraindicated if CrCl is less than 30 mL/min.

**Administration:**  Wait at least 10 minutes between applying brinzolamide and other topical ophthalmic medications.  Remove contact lenses before application and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.  Avoid touching the tip of the bottle to the eye or surrounding areas to prevent contamination.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Foreign body sensation in the eye
* Eye redness (hyperemia)
* Skin rash (dermatitis)
* Altered taste (dysgeusia)

* Eyelid inflammation (blepharitis)
* Eye discharge
* Eye discomfort or pain
* Eye itching
* Inflammation of the cornea (keratitis)
* Dry eyes (xerophthalmia)
* Runny nose (rhinitis)


**Less Common Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Eye strain (asthenopia)
* Chest pain
* Conjunctivitis
* Corneal disease
* Crusting of the eyelid
* Diarrhea
* Double vision (diplopia)
* Dizziness
* Indigestion (dyspepsia)
* Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
* Allergic reactions
* High blood pressure
* Increased muscle tone
* Keratoconjunctivitis (inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva)
* Watering eyes (lacrimation)
* Nausea
* Sore throat (pharyngitis)
* Kidney pain
* Hives (urticaria)
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme involved in the production of aqueous humor in the eye. By inhibiting this enzyme, brinzolamide reduces the amount of aqueous humor produced, thereby lowering the IOP.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Allergy to brinzolamide, sulfonamides, or any component of the formulation.
* Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min).
* Hyperchloremic acidosis (a type of metabolic acidosis).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment and those with low endothelial cell counts (important cells in the cornea).  Patients with low endothelial cell counts are at increased risk of corneal edema.
* Brinzolamide may enhance the adverse effects of other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; avoid concomitant use.
* Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase brinzolamide serum concentrations; monitor therapy if using concurrently.
* Pregnancy Category C:  The risk to the fetus is unknown. Discuss the potential risks and benefits with your healthcare provider.  
* Breastfeeding:  It is unknown whether brinzolamide is excreted in breast milk.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store brinzolamide?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I drive after using brinzolamide?** A:  Brinzolamide can cause blurred vision; avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I use brinzolamide with other eye drops?** A: It's important to wait at least 10 minutes between applying different eye drops to prevent interference and maximize effectiveness.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with brinzolamide use?** A: Long-term use is generally well-tolerated, but regular eye exams are crucial to monitor for any changes. Your ophthalmologist will provide guidance.
