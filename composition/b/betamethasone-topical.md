# Betamethasone (Topical)
### Generic Name
Betamethasone (Topical)

### Usage

Betamethasone topical is a corticosteroid used to relieve inflammation and itching associated with various skin conditions.  Its primary use is in treating corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, which are skin diseases that respond well to corticosteroid treatment.  These include conditions like eczema, dermatitis, and allergic reactions manifesting as skin inflammation and itching.  It's also approved for treating mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis in adults aged 18 years and older.  The specific formulation (cream, ointment, lotion, gel, foam, solution, spray, patch) may vary depending on the location and severity of the skin condition.

### Dosage

Dosage of topical betamethasone depends heavily on the severity of the condition, the patient's response to treatment, the specific formulation used, and the age of the patient.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  The following provides general guidance only and should not substitute for professional medical advice:

**Adults:** Dosage varies greatly depending on the formulation and the condition being treated.  For corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, applications range from once daily to twice daily, with maximum weekly doses sometimes specified for certain formulations (e.g., 50g weekly for some creams and gels).  For plaque psoriasis, treatment may involve twice-daily application of a spray for up to four weeks, or the use of patches with a maximum daily dose and treatment duration.  

**Children:**  Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration is crucial to minimize the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression.  Dosage for children also varies significantly by formulation and condition.  Augmented formulations are generally not recommended for children under 13 years old.  For adolescents (â‰¥12 years), the dosage may approach adult recommendations, but careful monitoring is still needed.  Specific instructions for pediatric use should always come directly from a pediatrician or dermatologist.

**Important Note:**  The different formulations (cream, ointment, lotion, gel, foam, solution, spray, patch) have varying strengths and application methods.  Always follow the specific instructions provided with your prescription.

### Side Effects

Common Side Effects:

* Application-site reactions (irritation, burning, itching, dryness)
* HPA-axis suppression (with prolonged or high-potency use)

Less Common but Serious Side Effects:

* Thinning of the skin (atrophy)
* Stretch marks (striae)
* Acne
* Increased risk of infection
* Allergic contact dermatitis
* Glaucoma and cataracts (with prolonged use around the eyes)
* Changes in skin pigmentation

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as less common or serious, consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Topical betamethasone is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation and itching.  It achieves this by suppressing the activity of substances in the body that trigger inflammation, such as histamine and prostaglandins.  By inhibiting these mediators, betamethasone reduces swelling, redness, and itching at the application site.  The potency of betamethasone varies depending on the formulation used, ranging from intermediate to very high.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Betamethasone is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to betamethasone, other corticosteroids, or any component of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** Interactions with other medications are possible.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  For example, combining betamethasone with aldesleukin may diminish the antineoplastic effect of aldesleukin.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding should be approached cautiously.  The lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration.  Avoid application to the breasts during breastfeeding to minimize infant exposure. Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Children:** Use in children requires careful monitoring due to the risk of HPA axis suppression.  The lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible time.
* **Elderly:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, requiring careful monitoring.
* **Occlusive dressings:** Avoid covering the application area with occlusive dressings unless specifically instructed by your doctor.
