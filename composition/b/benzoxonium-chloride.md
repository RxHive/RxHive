# Benzoxonium Chloride
### Generic Name
Benzoxonium Chloride

### Usage
Benzoxonium chloride is primarily used as an antiseptic for treating infections of the mouth and throat.  It's effective against a range of bacteria, providing relief from symptoms associated with these infections. While its primary use is for oral and throat ailments, it's important to note that this information should not be considered medical advice, and a healthcare professional should always be consulted for diagnosis and treatment.

### Dosage
**Mouth and throat infections (oral lozenge):**  The typical adult dosage is 1 mg every 1-3 hours for 4-6 days. The exact duration of treatment depends on the severity of the infection and should be determined by a healthcare professional.  Dosage information for children is not readily available in standard resources and should be obtained from a pediatrician or other qualified medical professional.  There is no specific dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment mentioned in standard medical literature.

### Side Effects
* Localized reactions such as stinging or burning sensations (temporary) are possible.

While rare, it's important to report any unusual or persistent symptoms to a doctor immediately.

### How it Works
The precise mechanism of action of benzoxonium chloride isn't fully understood.  However, research suggests it works by disrupting or inactivating certain bacterial enzymes crucial for their survival. This action leads to both bactericidal (killing bacteria) and bacteriostatic (inhibiting bacterial growth) effects, depending on the concentration used.


### Precautions
* **Allergy:** Benzoxonium chloride is contraindicated in individuals with known allergies to benzyl derivatives or similar synthetic compounds.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Benzoxonium chloride is categorized as a Pregnancy Category C drug, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  Breastfeeding should be avoided while using this medication, as its excretion into breast milk is unknown.
* **Severe Respiratory Disease:**  Benzoxonium chloride should be avoided in patients with severe respiratory conditions.
* **Deep Oral Ulcers:** Avoid using benzoxonium chloride for throat infections in the presence of deep oral ulcers.
