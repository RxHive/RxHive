The specific effectiveness of beclomethasone will depend on the individual condition and its severity.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific condition being treated and the patient's response.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

**Adults:** For corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, a 0.025% cream is typically applied as a thin film to the affected area 1-3 times daily. The frequency may be adjusted based on the severity of the condition and your response to treatment.

**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of beclomethasone topical in children have not been established. It should not be used in children unless specifically prescribed and monitored by a pediatrician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, according to current manufacturer labeling. However, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for any adjustments based on individual health conditions.


### Side Effects

Common side effects, while not always experienced, may include:

*   Thinning of the skin
*   Loss of skin elasticity
*   Increased hair growth (hirsutism) at the application site
*   Acne at the application site
*   Mild skin discoloration (depigmentation)
*   Rosacea (in susceptible individuals)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects,  may include adrenal suppression with prolonged use and other systemic effects due to absorption.  If you experience any unusual or worsening symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Beclomethasone is a potent topical corticosteroid.  It works by reducing inflammation in the skin.  It achieves this by suppressing the release of various inflammatory substances in the body, such as histamine and prostaglandins. By inhibiting these mediators, beclomethasone reduces swelling, redness, itching, and other symptoms of inflammatory skin diseases.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Beclomethasone topical is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to beclomethasone or any component of the formulation. It should not be used on infected skin lesions (viral, fungal, or bacterial) without concomitant treatment of the infection. It is also contraindicated during pregnancy.
*   **Interactions:**  The interaction with aldesleukin is noteworthy. Beclomethasone may diminish the effect of aldesleukin, an antineoplastic agent.  This combination should be avoided. Consult your doctor regarding any other medications you are taking, as interactions may occur.
*   **Warnings:**  Prolonged or extensive use of topical corticosteroids can lead to adrenal suppression and other systemic effects.  The risk of skin atrophy and other local adverse effects increases with prolonged use.  Use only the smallest amount needed to control symptoms.  Avoid application to the face unless directed by a physician. Avoid applying an occlusive dressing over the treated area as this increases absorption. There is increased risk of skin infections and opportunistic infections. This medication can lead to Kaposiâ€™s Sarcoma. 
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Beclomethasone is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. Use during pregnancy is generally contraindicated unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  The excretion of beclomethasone in breast milk is unknown.
