# Bilastine
### Generic Name
Bilastine

### Usage
Bilastine is a second-generation H1-antihistamine primarily used for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in adults and children aged 12 years and older.  This includes both seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), characterized by symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes and nose, and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), manifesting as hives (urticaria) and intense itching (pruritus).  It's important to note that while approved in the European Union, Bilastine isn't currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

### Dosage
**Adults (18 years and older) and Adolescents (12 years and older) for Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis and Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria:** The usual dose is 20 mg orally once daily. Treatment should continue as long as symptoms persist.

**Children under 12 years of age:**  The safety and efficacy of Bilastine haven't been established in this age group.  It should not be used in children younger than 12.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are typically needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, it's crucial to consult a doctor before using Bilastine if you have any liver or kidney problems.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Somnolence (sleepiness)
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Upper abdominal pain

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, reported post-marketing or in case reports):**  A wide range of less frequent side effects have been reported, including various gastrointestinal issues,  cardiac abnormalities (like QT prolongation), skin reactions, neurological symptoms (anxiety, insomnia, etc.), and other systemic effects.  These are not exhaustive.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or concerning, immediately consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works
Bilastine is a selective peripheral H1 receptor antagonist.  This means it works by blocking the action of histamine at its H1 receptors, primarily located in peripheral tissues.  Histamine is a chemical released during allergic reactions, causing many of the symptoms associated with allergies, such as itching, sneezing, and inflammation. By blocking histamine's effects, Bilastine helps relieve these symptoms.  Importantly, it does not significantly affect muscarinic receptors, reducing the risk of certain side effects associated with some other antihistamines.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Bilastine or any ingredient in the formulation.
* Patients with a history of QT prolongation (a specific type of heart rhythm abnormality) and/or torsades de pointes (a type of rapid, irregular heartbeat). This includes those with congenital long QT syndromes.

**Increased Risk:**

* QT interval prolongation: Bilastine may increase the risk of QT interval prolongation, a potentially serious heart rhythm problem.

**Use with caution:**

* In patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), significant bradycardia (slow heart rate), a family history of sudden cardiac death, or electrolyte abnormalities (like low potassium or magnesium).
* In patients taking other medications that can prolong the QT interval.
* During pregnancy and breastfeeding, as the safety profile isn't fully established.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Bilastine with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking, as interactions are possible, especially with drugs that prolong the QT interval.

* **Q: How should I store Bilastine?** A: Store Bilastine as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery after taking Bilastine?** A:  Avoid driving or operating machinery if you experience drowsiness or dizziness.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.  Follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Q: Is Bilastine addictive?** A: No, Bilastine is not considered an addictive medication.
