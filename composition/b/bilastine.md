# Bilastine

**Generic Name:** Bilastine

**Usage:**

Bilastine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and urticaria (hives) in adults and children over 12 years of age.  These symptoms can include sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose/eyes/throat, and itchy/watery eyes. In the case of urticaria, it helps relieve itching and rash. It's a non-sedating antihistamine, meaning it's less likely to cause drowsiness than some other antihistamines.

**Side Effects:**

Bilastine is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur. These are usually mild and temporary.  Common side effects include:

* Headache
* Fatigue (tiredness)
* Nausea
* Dizziness
* Somnolence (sleepiness) â€“ Although less common than with other antihistamines.


Less common side effects may include:

* Abdominal pain
* Vomiting
* Dry mouth
* Insomnia (difficulty sleeping)


Rare but serious side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe allergic reactions (such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) or any other concerning symptoms.

**How it Works:**

Bilastine is a selective antagonist of the peripheral histamine H1 receptor.  This means it blocks histamine from binding to these receptors on cells. Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction, causing the symptoms mentioned above. By blocking histamine's action, bilastine reduces or prevents these symptoms.  Importantly, it primarily affects peripheral H1 receptors and has minimal effects on the central nervous system, explaining its generally non-sedating nature.
