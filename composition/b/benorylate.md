# Benorylate
### Generic Name
Benorylate

### Usage
Benorylate is a combination drug that was previously used to treat mild to moderate pain, fever, and inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue rheumatism.  It combines the actions of aspirin and paracetamol (acetaminophen). However, it's important to note that benorylate is no longer widely available on the market because its benefits haven't been shown to outweigh those of using aspirin or paracetamol individually.


### Dosage
Because benorylate is no longer readily available, specific dosage information is difficult to obtain reliably.  Dosage recommendations varied depending on the condition being treated and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow the prescribing information provided by a healthcare professional if you have access to an older prescription.  It was typically available in tablet form.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of benorylate could include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Indigestion
* Dizziness
* Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
* Hearing loss (in rare cases)


Less common, but more serious side effects, could include allergic reactions (such as skin rash, swelling, difficulty breathing) and gastrointestinal bleeding.  High doses could lead to toxicity from both aspirin and paracetamol components.

**If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, stop taking benorylate and seek immediate medical advice.**


### How it Works
Benorylate is an ester that breaks down rapidly in the bloodstream into aspirin (salicylate) and paracetamol (acetaminophen). Both of these components contribute to its effects:

* **Aspirin (salicylate):**  Reduces pain, fever, and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to these symptoms.
* **Paracetamol (acetaminophen):**  Reduces pain and fever, although its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood. It's believed to act on the central nervous system to reduce fever and pain signals.

Benorylateâ€™s action on the inflamed synovial membrane (the lining of the joints) was also once believed to contribute to its effectiveness in treating joint conditions.


### Precautions
Benorylate should be used cautiously, particularly by:

* **Individuals with a history of aspirin or paracetamol allergy:** There's a risk of cross-reactivity.
* **People with asthma, bleeding disorders, or peptic ulcers:** Aspirin can exacerbate these conditions.
* **Pregnant or breastfeeding women:** Benorylate should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding if specifically prescribed by a doctor, and under close supervision due to potential risks to the fetus or infant.
* **Children and older adults:**  Dosage adjustments might have been necessary; however, precise details are currently unavailable.

**Never exceed the recommended dosage.**  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, as interactions with other drugs are possible.


### FAQs
