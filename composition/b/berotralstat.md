# Berotralstat
### Generic Name
Berotralstat

### Usage
Berotralstat is a medication used to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults and children aged 12 years and older.  Hereditary angioedema is a rare genetic disorder causing swelling in various parts of the body.  Berotralstat works by inhibiting the activity of plasma kallikrein, an enzyme involved in the production of bradykinin, a substance that contributes to HAE attacks.  It's crucial to understand that berotralstat is for preventing attacks, not treating acute attacks that are already happening.  Other treatments are needed for those situations.

### Dosage

**Adults (≥18 years):** The usual dose is 150 mg taken orally once daily.

**Children and Adolescents (≥12 years):** The usual dose is also 150 mg orally once daily.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 150 mg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For individuals with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), no dosage adjustment is needed. However, those with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B and C) should take a reduced dose of 110 mg once daily.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Generally, no dosage adjustment is necessary for individuals with mild to severe renal impairment. However, berotralstat is not recommended for those with end-stage renal disease (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²) or those undergoing hemodialysis.
* **Gastrointestinal Reactions:** In children 12 years and older experiencing persistent gastrointestinal issues (abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea), the dose may be reduced to 110 mg once daily.  Always consult a doctor before adjusting the dosage.


**Administration:** Berotralstat should be taken orally and is best administered with food.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Flatulence
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
* Back pain

**Rare Side Effects (occurring in less than 1% of patients):**

* Maculopapular rash (a skin rash)

**Important Note:**  If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.  This list is not exhaustive, and other side effects may occur.

### How it Works

Berotralstat works by inhibiting plasma kallikrein, a key enzyme in the body that plays a significant role in the production of bradykinin. In individuals with HAE,  bradykinin levels can become excessively high, leading to the characteristic swelling and pain.  By inhibiting kallikrein, berotralstat reduces the production of bradykinin, thus helping to prevent HAE attacks.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Animal studies haven't shown adverse effects, but there's limited human data. Other treatments are generally preferred during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Consult your doctor.
* **Liver and Kidney Function:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.
* **QT Prolongation:**  Higher doses of berotralstat (greater than 150 mg) have been associated with a potential risk of QT prolongation (a heart rhythm abnormality).  It's important to strictly adhere to the prescribed dosage and avoid exceeding it.  Do not use this drug for treating acute HAE attacks.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While specific drug interactions aren't extensively documented, always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take berotralstat to treat an acute HAE attack?** A: No, berotralstat is only for preventing HAE attacks, not for treating them when they occur.  You need different medication for acute attacks.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store berotralstat?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking berotralstat without talking to my doctor?** A: No,  always discuss any changes to your medication regimen with your doctor before stopping treatment.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking berotralstat?** A: It's best to take it with food to improve absorption.  No specific dietary restrictions are generally noted.
