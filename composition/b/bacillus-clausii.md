# Bacillus Clausii
### Generic Name
Bacillus Clausii

### Usage
*Bacillus clausii* is a probiotic bacterium used primarily to improve gut health and support the intestinal barrier.  Its applications span a range of conditions, including:

* **Treatment and Prevention of Diarrhea:** *B. clausii* is frequently used to treat acute diarrhea and can help prevent diarrhea caused by various factors.

* **Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO):**  This probiotic has shown promise in managing SIBO, a condition marked by an excessive bacterial population in the small intestine.

* **Adverse Effects of *Helicobacter pylori* Therapy:**  It may be used to mitigate the gastrointestinal side effects that can occur during treatment for *H. pylori* infection.

* **Nasal Allergies (in Children):** Some studies suggest a potential benefit in reducing symptoms of nasal allergies in children.

* **Upper Respiratory Infections (in Children):**  There's evidence indicating a potential role in treating upper respiratory tract infections in children.

* **Prevention of Infection in Preterm Neonates:**  *B. clausii* is being investigated for its potential to prevent infections in premature infants.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on age, condition being treated, and formulation.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  The following is general information and should not be considered a substitute for personalized medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **General Use:** Typically 4-6 billion spores per day.  Short-term use is generally recommended.
* **Acute Diarrhea:**  One capsule (containing 2 billion CFU) twice daily for 10 days.  (Note: CFU stands for colony-forming units, a measure of bacterial viability. Spores are a more resistant form of the bacteria.)
* ***H. pylori* Treatment-Induced Adverse Effects:** 2 billion spores three times daily, along with *H. pylori* treatment for 7 days and for 7 days after.
* **Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO):** 2 billion spores three times daily for one month.


**Children:**

* **General Use:** 2-4 billion spores per day. Short-term use is generally recommended.
* **Nasal Allergies:** 3 vials (each containing 2 billion spores) per day for 3 weeks.
* **Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (Children 3-6 years):** 2 mL of suspension (containing 2 billion spores per 5 mL) twice daily for 90 days.
* **Prevention of Sepsis in Preterm Neonates (less than 34 weeks gestational age):** 2 mL of suspension (2 billion spores per 5 mL) every 8 hours, mixed with enteral feeds (totaling approximately 2.4 billion spores per day) until 6 weeks postnatal age, discharge, death, or onset of late-onset sepsis.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

*Bacillus clausii* is generally well-tolerated, but potential side effects can include:

* Mild gastrointestinal discomfort (e.g., bloating, gas)
* Allergic reactions (rare)

Serious side effects are uncommon.  If you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

*Bacillus clausii* is a probiotic, meaning it introduces beneficial bacteria into the gut.  These bacteria can help restore the balance of the gut microbiota (the community of bacteria in the intestine).  The specific mechanisms are complex and not fully understood, but they include:

* **Production of substances that inhibit harmful bacteria.**
* **Competition with harmful bacteria for resources and space.**
* **Stimulation of the immune system.**
* **Improvement of the intestinal barrier function.**


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  *B. clausii* is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to it or any of its excipients (inactive ingredients).
* **Antibiotic Use:** When using *B. clausii* alongside antibiotics, administer them at different times to avoid interference.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  *B. clausii* is considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Dosage for breastfeeding infants should be as advised by a healthcare professional.
* **Children:** Always follow pediatric dosage guidelines and seek professional medical advice before giving probiotics to children.


### FAQs

* **How should I store *Bacillus clausii*?** Follow the storage instructions on the product label.  Generally, probiotics should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

* **Can I take *Bacillus clausii* with other medications?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, to avoid potential interactions.

* **How long will it take to see results?** The time it takes to see benefits varies depending on the individual and the condition being treated.

* **What if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for your next dose. Don't double the dose.

* **Can I stop taking *Bacillus clausii* suddenly?** It's generally safe to stop taking *Bacillus clausii* without tapering, but consult your healthcare provider if you have any concerns.
