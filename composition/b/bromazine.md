# Bromazine
### Generic Name
Bromazine (Bromodiphenhydramine)

### Usage
Bromazine, also known as bromodiphenhydramine, is primarily used to alleviate symptoms associated with allergies, particularly those affecting the skin.  It's effective in managing symptoms of hay fever and other allergic reactions.  Additionally, it has mucoactive properties, meaning it can help thin and loosen mucus, making it useful in treating some upper respiratory tract disorders characterized by mucus buildup.  This dual action makes it beneficial for conditions involving both allergic inflammation and mucus congestion.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the patient's age and the specific condition being treated.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions.

**Adults (Cough and Upper Respiratory Tract Disorders):**

* **Oral Syrup (5-25 mg/5 mL):**  1-2 teaspoonfuls every 4-6 hours.  The maximum daily dose is 150 mg.


**Children (Cough and Upper Respiratory Tract Disorders):**

* **Children under 6 years:**  Safety and efficacy have not been established.  Bromazine should not be given to this age group.
* **Children over 6 years:**  Oral syrup (6.25-12.5 mg/5 mL): 1-2 teaspoonfuls every 6 hours.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment have not been established.  Consult a doctor before using Bromazine if you have liver or kidney problems.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Sedation or sleepiness
* Confusion
* Restlessness
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Dry mouth

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Palpitations
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Blood disorders (thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, agranulocytosis)
* Allergic reactions
* Hallucinations
* Seizures

If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Bromazine is an antihistamine that works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions. Histamine causes symptoms like itching, sneezing, and inflammation. By competing with histamine for binding sites on histamine receptors, Bromazine prevents histamine from triggering these symptoms.  Its mucoactive properties contribute to its effectiveness in conditions with mucus involvement.


### Precautions
Bromazine is contraindicated in:

* Premature or newborn infants
* Individuals with known hypersensitivity to bromazine or its salts
* Patients with blood disorders, cardiac, or vascular disease.


Use with caution in:

* Patients with increased intraocular pressure (glaucoma)
* Patients with hypertension or cardiovascular disease
* Patients with peptic ulcers
* Patients with prostatic hypertrophy or genitourinary obstruction
* Patients with liver disease
* Patients with Reye's syndrome
* Patients with epilepsy
* Patients with jaundice
* Concomitant use with general anesthetics
* Patients with hyperthyroidism


Bromazine may interact with other medications, particularly central nervous system depressants (like sedatives or opioids) and other anticholinergic drugs.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking before starting Bromazine.  It can also interfere with allergy skin tests; discontinue use several days before testing.
