# Betrixaban
### Generic Name
Betrixaban

### Usage

Betrixaban is an anticoagulant medication primarily used for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adults hospitalized for an acute medical illness.  VTE encompasses two serious conditions: deep vein thrombosis (DVT), where blood clots form in deep veins, usually in the legs, and pulmonary embolism (PE), where a blood clot travels to the lungs. Betrixaban is specifically indicated for patients with moderately or severely restricted mobility and other risk factors for VTE.  It helps prevent these clots from forming in the first place, reducing the risk of potentially life-threatening complications.  It is *not* used to treat existing VTE.


### Dosage

Betrixaban is administered orally.  The dosage for adults to prevent VTE is as follows:

* **Day 1:** 160 mg as a single dose.
* **Days 2-35/42:** 80 mg once daily.  The exact duration of treatment (35 or 42 days) will be determined by a healthcare provider based on the individual patient's needs.

**Important Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with reduced kidney function (creatinine clearance).  Consult a physician for specific instructions.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Betrixaban should generally be avoided in patients with moderate to severe liver impairment.
* **Obesity:**  The use of Betrixaban in patients with a BMI >40 kg/mÂ² or weighing >120 kg is generally not recommended due to limited data.  If used in such patients, close monitoring might be necessary.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Headache
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Urinary tract infection
* Hematuria (blood in the urine)
* Hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Epistaxis (nosebleed)

Less common, but serious side effects may include hypersensitivity reactions and major hemorrhage (including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and intraocular bleeding).  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any signs of serious bleeding or an allergic reaction.**


### How it Works

Betrixaban is a direct and selective factor Xa inhibitor. Factor Xa is a crucial enzyme in the blood clotting cascade.  By inhibiting factor Xa, Betrixaban prevents the formation of thrombin, a protein essential for blood clot formation. This ultimately reduces the risk of blood clots forming in the veins.


### Precautions

* **Bleeding:** Betrixaban increases the risk of bleeding.  Avoid activities that may increase the risk of injury.  Inform your doctor about any unusual bleeding or bruising.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Use caution in patients with reduced kidney or liver function; dosage adjustments may be necessary or the medication may be contraindicated.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Betrixaban is generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Alternative anticoagulants are preferred.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Betrixaban may interact with other medications, particularly those affecting blood clotting (anticoagulants, antiplatelets), NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and P-glycoprotein inhibitors.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Spinal/Epidural Hematoma:**  There is an increased risk of spinal or epidural hematoma (bleeding around the spinal cord) in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture while on Betrixaban. This can lead to paralysis.  Discuss this risk with your healthcare provider.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Betrixaban is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* **Active Bleeding:**  Betrixaban is contraindicated in patients with active pathological bleeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Betrixaban if I feel better?** A: No, never stop taking Betrixaban without consulting your doctor.  Premature discontinuation can increase your risk of blood clots.
* **Q: How should I store Betrixaban?** A: Store Betrixaban as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Betrixaban?** A:  Consult your doctor about alcohol consumption while taking Betrixaban. Alcohol can increase the risk of bleeding.
* **Q: Is Betrixaban safe for older adults?** A:  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.  Close monitoring might be necessary.  Discuss any concerns with your doctor.
