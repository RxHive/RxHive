# Biphasic Insulin
### Generic Name
Biphasic Insulin

### Usage
Biphasic insulin is a combination insulin used primarily to manage type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's designed to control blood sugar levels throughout the day by providing both immediate and long-term effects in a single injection. The short-acting component provides rapid glucose control, while the long-acting component offers sustained background insulin coverage. This makes it a convenient option for individuals requiring both rapid and prolonged insulin action.


### Dosage
Biphasic insulin dosage is highly individualized and determined by a healthcare professional based on factors such as the patient's blood glucose levels, weight, activity level, diet, and overall health.  There's no single universal dosage.

* **Adults:**  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) suggests starting with a total daily dose (TDD) of approximately 0.4-0.5 units/kg/day, administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  This TDD is usually divided into multiple doses throughout the day.  The precise dosage and frequency will be adjusted based on the individual's response and blood glucose monitoring results.  Conservative initial doses (0.2-0.4 units/kg/day) may be considered to minimize hypoglycemia risk, particularly in obese or sedentary individuals.  Higher initial doses may be necessary in cases of ketoacidosis.

* **Children:** Pediatric dosing is also individualized and should be determined by a healthcare provider experienced in managing pediatric diabetes. The dosage will be adjusted based on the child's age, weight, and response to treatment.

* **Administration:** Biphasic insulin is administered subcutaneously via injection.  Common injection sites include the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, and upper arms. Rotating injection sites is crucial to prevent lipohypertrophy (thickening of the skin) or lipoatrophy (thinning of the skin) at the injection site.


### Side Effects
Common side effects:

* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) â€“ this is a serious side effect and can cause symptoms such as dizziness, sweating, shakiness, confusion, and even loss of consciousness.
* Allergic reactions (rare but potentially severe).
* Lipodystrophy (changes in fat tissue at the injection site).
* Edema (swelling)


Less common but serious side effects:

* Severe hypoglycemia (requiring medical attention)
* Insulin resistance (body's decreased response to insulin)


If you experience any adverse effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Biphasic insulin contains a mixture of rapid-acting and long-acting insulin. The rapid-acting insulin quickly lowers blood glucose levels after meals, while the long-acting component provides a steady, basal level of insulin throughout the day, preventing excessively high blood sugar between meals and overnight.  The insulin works by binding to receptors on cells, facilitating glucose uptake and utilization. This helps regulate blood glucose levels within the target range.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Biphasic insulin is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to insulin or a history of severe hypoglycemic episodes.

* **Interactions:** Numerous medications can interact with biphasic insulin, affecting its effectiveness and potentially increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.  These include but are not limited to: ACE inhibitors, antibacterial drugs, anti-diabetic drugs, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, corticosteroids, estrogens, progestins, loop diuretics, MAOIs, phenothiazines, protease inhibitors, salicylates, SSRIs, sympathomimetics, thiazide diuretics, and thyroid hormones.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Special Populations:**  Pregnant and breastfeeding women, individuals with impaired kidney or liver function, and older adults require close monitoring when using biphasic insulin due to altered pharmacokinetics and an increased risk of adverse events.

* **Hypoglycemia Warning:** Hypoglycemia is a significant risk with insulin therapy.  Patients should be educated about symptoms, treatment (glucose intake), and preventive measures such as regular blood glucose monitoring and appropriate meal timing and carbohydrate intake.



### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store biphasic insulin?**
    * **A:** Store unopened vials in the refrigerator. Once opened, store at room temperature and discard after the expiration date.  Avoid freezing.


* **Q: Can I mix biphasic insulin with other insulins?**
    * **A:**  Mixing with other insulins is generally not recommended unless specifically instructed by your doctor. The combination may alter the absorption and effectiveness of each insulin type.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
    * **A:**  Consult your doctor or diabetes educator for guidance on missed doses.  Never double up on doses without medical advice.


* **Q:  How often should I check my blood sugar?**
    * **A:**  Your healthcare provider will recommend a blood sugar monitoring schedule tailored to your needs, which usually involves multiple daily checks.


* **Q: What are the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia?**
    * **A:**  Symptoms include shakiness, sweating, dizziness, confusion, rapid heartbeat, and blurred vision.  Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness.  If you suspect hypoglycemia, consume a source of fast-acting carbohydrate (e.g., glucose tablets, juice).


* **Q:  Can I exercise while using biphasic insulin?**
    * **A:**  Exercise is beneficial for managing diabetes, but its timing and intensity should be discussed with your doctor or diabetes educator to prevent hypoglycemia. Blood glucose monitoring may be more frequent during periods of increased physical activity.
