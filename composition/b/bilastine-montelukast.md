# Bilastine + Montelukast

**Generic Name:** Bilastine + Montelukast

**Usage:** This combination medication is not currently approved or widely available as a single fixed-dose combination drug in most markets.  Bilastine and montelukast are typically prescribed separately.  Bilastine is an antihistamine used to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and urticaria (hives), while montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist used to prevent asthma attacks and treat allergic rhinitis.  A doctor might prescribe them together in specific cases where the benefits of both drugs outweigh the potential risks for a patient experiencing severe allergy symptoms or difficult-to-control asthma. This decision is made on a case-by-case basis and is not a standard treatment approach.

**Side Effects:** Since this isn't a standard combination, side effects would be the sum of those for each individual drug.

* **Bilastine:** Common side effects are generally mild and may include headache, fatigue, and somnolence (sleepiness). Less common side effects can include dizziness, nausea, and abdominal pain.
* **Montelukast:** Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain.  Less common, but more serious, side effects can include mood changes (including depression, anxiety, aggression, and suicidal thoughts), liver problems, and allergic reactions.

**How it Works:**

* **Bilastine:**  Works by blocking histamine H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and triggering allergic symptoms like sneezing, itching, and runny nose.  Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction.
* **Montelukast:** Works by blocking leukotrienes, inflammatory chemicals that contribute to asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms.  By blocking leukotrienes, it reduces airway inflammation, making breathing easier and reducing allergy symptoms.
