# Bilastine + Montelukast
### Generic Name
Bilastine + Montelukast

**Note:**  Bilastine and Montelukast are often combined in fixed-dose combination preparations.  However, it's crucial to understand that this information pertains to the *combined* effect of both drugs.  Bilastine and Montelukast are available as individual medications as well, and their usage in combination may differ from their use as standalone treatments. Always refer to the specific product information provided by your pharmacist or physician.


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and urticaria (hives).  Bilastine is an antihistamine that effectively blocks histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, thus reducing symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and hives. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist. Leukotrienes are inflammatory substances involved in allergic reactions and asthma.  By blocking leukotrienes, montelukast helps reduce inflammation in the airways and skin, providing additional relief from allergy symptoms. This combination therapy aims to offer broader and potentially more effective symptom control than either drug alone.  The combined action can be particularly helpful for individuals with moderate to severe allergic symptoms that don't respond adequately to a single medication.


### Dosage

Dosage for Bilastine + Montelukast combination products varies depending on the specific formulation and the manufacturer.  **Always follow the instructions provided on the prescription label.**  There is no universally standard dosage across all brands.  Dosage guidelines are usually determined by age and the severity of symptoms.  The information below is illustrative and not a substitute for professional medical advice.  This combination medication is typically administered orally. IV administration is not common for this specific combination.

* **Adults:**  A typical adult dose might involve one tablet or capsule once daily, usually at the same time each day.

### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Headache, drowsiness, nausea, dizziness, fatigue.  These are generally mild and resolve on their own.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Although rare, serious side effects can occur.  These include allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), liver problems, changes in mood or behavior, and gastrointestinal issues.
* **Note:** If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, discontinue use immediately and seek medical attention.


### How it Works

Bilastine, an antihistamine, works by competitively blocking histamine receptors (primarily H1 receptors) on the surface of cells. Histamine binding to these receptors triggers allergic reactions. By blocking histamine, Bilastine reduces the inflammatory response and associated symptoms.

Montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, inhibits the action of leukotrienes, inflammatory molecules that contribute to allergic reactions by causing bronchoconstriction (narrowing of airways), mucus production, and inflammation. By blocking leukotriene receptors, Montelukast helps to reduce inflammation and airway constriction, relieving allergy symptoms and potentially improving lung function.  The combination of these two mechanisms provides a wider range of action in controlling allergic symptoms.
