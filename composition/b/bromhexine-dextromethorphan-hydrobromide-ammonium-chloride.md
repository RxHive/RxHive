# Bromhexine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Ammonium Chloride

**Generic Name:** Bromhexine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Ammonium Chloride

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat symptoms of the common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections.  Specifically, it addresses:

* **Cough:** Dextromethorphan acts as a cough suppressant (antitussive), reducing the urge to cough.
* **Phlegm:** Bromhexine is an expectorant, helping to thin and loosen mucus (phlegm) in the airways, making it easier to cough up.
* **Congestion:** Ammonium chloride is also an expectorant, though its efficacy is debated and it may contribute to overall fluid balance changes.  It assists in thinning mucus.

This combination is intended for symptomatic relief and does not treat the underlying cause of the infection.  It's crucial to consult a doctor if symptoms worsen or persist for an extended period.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and dosage but may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset
* **Nervous System:** Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, nervousness
* **Respiratory:**  Rarely, worsening cough (paradoxical bronchospasm, especially in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - COPD)
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling
* **Others:**  Dry mouth, changes in urine output (due to ammonium chloride)

This is not an exhaustive list, and serious side effects are possible, though uncommon.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or unusual reactions.


**How it Works:**

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This acts centrally on the brain to suppress the cough reflex. It does not directly affect the production of mucus.
* **Bromhexine:** This reduces the viscosity (thickness) of mucus by altering the chemical structure of the mucus glycoproteins.  This makes it easier to expectorate (cough up) the phlegm.
* **Ammonium Chloride:** This increases the volume and fluidity of respiratory tract secretions via osmotic action. This helps loosen and thin the mucus, potentially making it easier to cough up.  However, its effectiveness is debated and its inclusion might be primarily for historical reasons.
