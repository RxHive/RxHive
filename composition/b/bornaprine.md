# Bornaprine
### Generic Name
Bornaprine

### Usage
Bornaprine is primarily used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, specifically focusing on tremor and other extrapyramidal symptoms.  Extrapyramidal symptoms are movement disorders that can arise as a side effect of certain medications, like antipsychotics (phenothiazines). Bornaprine helps alleviate these movement problems.  Importantly, it's not effective against tardive dyskinesia, a different type of movement disorder.  A secondary use for bornaprine is in the treatment of hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**

* **Parkinson's Disease:** The oral starting dose is typically 2 mg per day.  This is gradually increased, as tolerated, to a usual maintenance dose of 6-12 mg per day, divided into two or three doses.  It's crucial to increase the dosage slowly to avoid potential circulatory or nervous system problems.  Sudden cessation of treatment should also be avoided.  The exact dosage needs to be adjusted based on the individual's response and any side effects experienced.  Switching to a different medication should be done gradually.

* **Hyperhidrosis:** The effective oral dose usually ranges from 4-8 mg per day. The initial dose (often 2-4 mg per day) is typically increased gradually during the first week of treatment, based on individual needs.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Bornaprine is not approved for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Caution is advised when increasing the dose for elderly patients, particularly those with pre-existing brain conditions.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Confusion
* Dizziness
* Excitation
* Disorientation
* Memory loss
* Hallucinations (rare)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Heartburn
* Cycloplegia (paralysis of the ciliary muscle of the eye)
* Glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure)
* Urinary retention


If you experience any of these or other adverse effects, it's important to consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Bornaprine is an anticholinergic drug, meaning it works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the brain.  By reducing the activity of acetylcholine, it indirectly increases the relative activity of dopamine, another neurotransmitter crucial for movement control.  This helps to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and extrapyramidal symptoms.  It has both central (brain) and some peripheral effects.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Bornaprine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with narrow-angle glaucoma, psychosis or psycho-organic disturbances, mechanical obstructions in the gastrointestinal tract, and megacolon.

* **Use with caution:** Bornaprine should be used cautiously in patients with prostatic adenomas (enlarged prostate), tachycardia, and in elderly patients, or those at risk of seizures.

* **Drug Interactions:** Concurrent use with quinidine may increase cardiovascular effects.  Using bornaprine alongside levodopa can potentially worsen involuntary movements (dyskinesia).

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Bornaprine is not recommended during pregnancy.  Because its excretion in breast milk is unknown, breastfeeding should be avoided while taking this medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking bornaprine?**  A: No, it's advisable to avoid alcohol consumption while on bornaprine as it can potentiate its sedative effects.

* **Q: How should I store bornaprine?** A:  Store bornaprine as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I stop taking bornaprine suddenly?** A: No, stopping bornaprine abruptly can lead to complications.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually reducing the dosage before discontinuing treatment.

* **Q: Is bornaprine habit-forming?** A: Bornaprine is not considered a habit-forming medication.
