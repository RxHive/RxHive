# Belinostat
### Generic Name
Belinostat

### Usage
Belinostat is a medication used to treat relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma in adults.  This means it's used for patients whose lymphoma has come back after treatment (relapsed) or hasn't responded to previous treatments (refractory).  It's currently not approved for use in children.

### Dosage
Belinostat is administered intravenously (IV) as an infusion. The typical dosage for adults with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma is 1000 mg/m² given daily over 30 minutes on days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle.  Cycles are repeated until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.  

**Important Considerations:**  A patient's absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be ≥1000/mm³ and their platelet count ≥50,000/mm³ before each cycle of Belinostat. Dosage adjustments are necessary based on toxicity and specific patient factors.  Details on dosage adjustments for hepatic and renal impairment, obesity, and reduced UGT1A1 activity are provided below.  There is no established dosage for pediatric patients.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, though increased exposure is expected with hepatic impairment. Close monitoring is crucial.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustments are specified in the labeling for creatinine clearance (CrCl) above or below 39 mL/min. However, exposure isn't typically altered, suggesting dosage adjustment might not be necessary.
* **Obesity:**  The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends using actual body weight for dose calculations, especially for curative intent.  Manage toxicities as you would in non-obese patients. If dose reduction due to toxicity is necessary, consider resuming full weight-based dosing in subsequent cycles if the cause of toxicity resolves.
* **Toxicity Management (Hematologic):**  If the ANC falls below 500/mm³ or the platelet count falls below 25,000/mm³, the dose should be reduced to 750 mg/m².  If these low counts recur after two dose reductions, treatment should be discontinued.
* **Toxicity Management (Non-Hematologic):** Re-treatment should only begin if non-hematologic toxicities are grade 2 or lower. For grade 3 or 4 toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea), reduce the dose to 750 mg/m².  If grade 3 or 4 toxicity recurs after two dose reductions, discontinue treatment. Manage grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea with supportive care; reduce the dose only if symptoms last longer than 7 days despite supportive care.
* **UGT1A1 Activity:** For patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (reduced UGT1A1 activity), reduce the initial dose to 750 mg/m².

### How it Works
Belinostat is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. HDACs are enzymes that remove acetyl groups from proteins, including histones.  Histones are proteins that help package DNA in cells. By inhibiting HDACs, Belinostat increases the acetylation of histones, altering gene expression and leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells.  Belinostat exhibits preferential toxicity toward tumor cells compared to normal cells.

### Precautions
* **Pregnancy:** Belinostat is categorized as pregnancy category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus. Women should avoid pregnancy while on this medication. Effective contraception is necessary during treatment and for 6 months afterward for women and 3 months afterward for men.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for 2 weeks after the final dose.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Certain medications, such as atazanavir, gemfibrozil, indinavir, and ketoconazole, can increase Belinostat levels.  Strong UGT inhibitors also impact Belinostat metabolism; the starting dose should be reduced to 750 mg/m² when co-administered with these inhibitors. Consult a doctor about potential interactions with other drugs.
* **Bone Marrow Suppression:** Belinostat can suppress bone marrow function, leading to low blood cell counts (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia). Regular blood tests are essential.
* **Gastrointestinal Toxicity:** Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are common side effects.
* **Hepatotoxicity:** Belinostat can cause liver damage. Liver function tests should be monitored.
* **Infections:**  Serious infections are possible; avoid use in patients with active infections.
* **Tumor Lysis Syndrome:** This is a risk, particularly in patients with high tumor burden.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Belinostat stored?**  A: Refer to the specific instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor immediately. Do not attempt to make up for a missed dose without medical advice.

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking Belinostat?** A:  Belinostat can cause fatigue and dizziness. Avoid activities requiring alertness until you know how this medication affects you.

* **Q: Are there long-term effects of Belinostat?** A:  Long-term effects are not fully understood.  Regular monitoring and follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider are crucial.

* **Q: Who should not take Belinostat?** A:  Currently, there are no specific contraindications listed in the manufacturer's labeling, but its use should be approached with caution in patients with existing liver, kidney, or bone marrow issues.  It is not approved for use in children.
