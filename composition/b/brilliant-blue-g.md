# Brilliant Blue G
### Generic Name
Brilliant Blue G

### Usage
Brilliant Blue G is an ophthalmic dye used primarily as a surgical aid in ophthalmic procedures.  Its main purpose is to selectively stain the internal limiting membrane (ILM) during vitrectomy.  This staining improves the visibility of the ILM, making it easier for surgeons to precisely remove it during retinal detachment repair or other vitreoretinal surgeries.  It's crucial to understand that Brilliant Blue G is not used to treat any disease independently but acts as a visual aid during surgery.

### Dosage
**Surgical aid (ophthalmic):**

* **Intravitreal injection:** 0.5 mL is injected into the vitreous cavity filled with balanced salt solution.  The exact amount and injection technique are determined by the ophthalmologist performing the procedure.  The dye is injected, allowed to stain the ILM (usually within seconds), and then excess dye is immediately removed.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  However, adjustments are considered unlikely due to the minimal systemic absorption of the dye following intravitreal injection and removal of excess dye.

### Side Effects
No adverse reactions are listed in the manufacturer's labeling for Brilliant Blue G when used as directed during surgical procedures with subsequent removal of excess dye.


### How it Works
Brilliant Blue G works by selectively binding to the internal limiting membrane (ILM). This binding creates a visible stain that contrasts with the surrounding retinal tissue. This enhanced visualization allows the surgeon to precisely identify and remove the ILM during surgery.  It does not have a therapeutic effect beyond improving surgical visibility.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** No contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Warnings:**  Care must be taken during administration to avoid contact between the cannula and the retina and to prevent dye from getting under the retina. Excess dye should be promptly removed after sufficient staining.  Ensure the syringe plunger moves smoothly before use; discard if it does not.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Absorption following intravitreal injection and removal of excess dye is negligible; fetal exposure is not expected.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, but exposure to an infant via breast milk is not expected due to the negligible absorption.

### FAQs

* **Q: What is Brilliant Blue G used for?**
    * **A:** It's used as a surgical aid during ophthalmic procedures, specifically to stain the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and improve its visibility for surgical removal.

* **Q: Is Brilliant Blue G a treatment for a disease?**
    * **A:** No, it's not a treatment; it's a dye that improves the surgeon's ability to perform a procedure.

* **Q: Are there any significant side effects?**
    * **A:** No adverse reactions are listed in the manufacturer's labeling when used as directed.

* **Q: How is Brilliant Blue G administered?**
    * **A:** It is injected intravitreally during surgery by an ophthalmologist.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience any problems?**
    * **A:**  This medication is only administered by an ophthalmologist during surgery, so any concerns should be addressed directly with them post-procedure.
