# Bromfenac

**Generic Name:** Bromfenac

**Usage:**

Bromfenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce pain and inflammation in the eye after cataract surgery.  It's specifically used as a topical ophthalmic solution (eye drops).  It's *not* used for other types of pain or inflammation.

**Side Effects:**

Like other NSAIDs, bromfenac can cause side effects, although they are generally mild and temporary.  Common side effects include:

* **Burning, stinging, or itching:**  These are often felt immediately after applying the eye drops.
* **Eye discomfort:** This can include dryness, irritation, or a foreign body sensation.
* **Blurred vision:** This is usually temporary.
* **Headache:**  A less common side effect.
* **Allergic reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions (such as rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing) are possible.  Stop use and seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.

Less common, but more serious side effects, though rare,  can include:

* **Corneal ulceration (rare but serious):** Damage to the cornea.
* **Increased risk of infection:** Though rare, the suppression of inflammation can mask an infection.


**How it Works:**

Bromfenac works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are substances in the body that cause inflammation and pain. By reducing prostaglandin production in the eye, bromfenac helps to decrease pain and inflammation after cataract surgery.

**FAQs:**

* **How long do I use bromfenac?**  The length of treatment is determined by your ophthalmologist and typically lasts for a specific period after surgery, usually several days to a couple of weeks.
* **Can I wear contact lenses while using bromfenac?**  You should generally avoid wearing contact lenses while using bromfenac.  Consult your ophthalmologist for specific instructions.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Can I use bromfenac with other eye medications?**  Inform your ophthalmologist about all medications you are using, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to avoid potential interactions.
* **Can I drive after using bromfenac?**  Blurred vision is a possible side effect.  Do not drive or operate machinery if your vision is affected.
* **Is bromfenac safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  The safety of bromfenac during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your doctor or ophthalmologist before using bromfenac if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
