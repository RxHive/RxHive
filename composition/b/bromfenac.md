# Bromfenac
### Generic Name
Bromfenac

### Usage
Bromfenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) specifically used to treat postoperative inflammation and reduce eye pain in patients who have undergone cataract surgery.  Its primary use is in managing the discomfort and inflammation that commonly follow this type of procedure.  It's crucial to understand that Bromfenac is for ophthalmic (eye) use only and is not suitable for treating other types of inflammation or pain.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific Bromfenac formulation (concentration and frequency of administration). Always follow your ophthalmologist's instructions precisely.  Generally, for adults undergoing cataract surgery:

* **Drops (0.07%):** 1 drop in the affected eye(s) once daily (OD), starting one day before surgery, continuing on the day of surgery, and for 14 days afterward.
* **Drops (0.075%):** 1 drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID), starting one day before surgery, continuing on the day of surgery, and for 14 days afterward.
* **Drops (0.09% once-daily):** 1 drop in the affected eye(s) once daily (OD), starting one day before surgery, continuing on the surgery day, and for 14 days afterward.
* **Drops (0.09% twice-daily):** 1 drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID), starting 24 hours after surgery and continuing for 14 days.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Bromfenac in children have not been established.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):

* Headache
* Eye irritation (redness, itching, burning, discomfort)
* Conjunctival hyperemia (redness of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the eyelid and covering the white of the eye)
* Anterior chamber inflammation (inflammation in the fluid-filled space behind the cornea)
* Iritis (inflammation of the iris, the colored part of the eye)
* Ocular hypertension (increased eye pressure)
* Vitreous opacity (cloudiness in the vitreous humor, the gel-like substance filling the eye)


Less common but serious side effects (occurring in less than 1%, often reported post-marketing):

* Corneal erosion, thinning, perforation (damage to the cornea)
* Epithelial keratopathy (damage to the cornea's outer layer)
* Prolonged bleeding time
* Impaired wound healing

**If you experience any of these side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works
Bromfenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are substances in the body that contribute to inflammation and pain. By reducing prostaglandin production, Bromfenac helps to decrease inflammation and pain in the eye after cataract surgery.  It specifically targets the cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) involved in prostaglandin synthesis.


### Precautions
* **Contraindicated:** Bromfenac should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Bromfenac or any ingredients in the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of keratitis (inflammation of the cornea), corneal thinning, erosion, perforation, or ulceration, and subsequent vision loss.
* **Use with caution:**  Bromfenac should be used cautiously in patients with a history of aspirin or NSAID sensitivity, bleeding disorders, diabetes, pre-existing ocular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or those receiving concomitant topical steroid therapy.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Bromfenac is categorized as pregnancy Category C.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution during breastfeeding.
