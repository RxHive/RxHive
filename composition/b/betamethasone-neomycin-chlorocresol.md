# Betamethasone + Neomycin + Chlorocresol

**Generic Name:** Betamethasone + Neomycin + Chlorocresol

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used topically (applied to the skin) to treat inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema, dermatitis, and psoriasis that are complicated by bacterial infection.  The betamethasone provides anti-inflammatory and anti-itch effects, the neomycin provides antibacterial action, and the chlorocresol acts as a preservative.  **It's crucial to note that this is a prescription medication and should only be used under the guidance of a doctor.**  Self-treating can lead to complications.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the duration of use. Common side effects may include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, redness, and peeling at the application site.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing (rare but serious).  Allergic reactions to any of the components are possible.
* **Skin thinning (atrophy):** Prolonged use of corticosteroids like betamethasone can thin the skin, making it more susceptible to damage.
* **Skin discoloration (hypopigmentation):**  Loss of skin pigment.
* **Striae (stretch marks):** Particularly with prolonged use in areas subject to stretching.
* **Secondary infections:**  Although neomycin is an antibiotic, prolonged or improper use can lead to fungal or other resistant bacterial infections.
* **Systemic effects:** Although rare with topical application, absorption of betamethasone into the bloodstream can occur, especially with large surface area application or occlusive dressings. Systemic effects can include increased blood sugar, fluid retention, and changes in blood pressure.

**How it Works:**

* **Betamethasone:** This is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response in the skin. It works by decreasing the production of inflammatory substances.
* **Neomycin:** This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that kills bacteria by inhibiting protein synthesis. This helps to control secondary bacterial infections often associated with inflamed skin.
* **Chlorocresol:**  This is a preservative that helps prevent the growth of microorganisms in the preparation, extending its shelf life.
