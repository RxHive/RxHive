# Bacillus Mesentericus
### Generic Name
Bacillus Mesentericus

### Usage
Bacillus mesentericus is a probiotic bacterium used primarily to treat various gastrointestinal disorders. Its main application lies in managing antibiotic-associated diarrhea, as well as infectious and viral diarrheas.  This is achieved by improving the balance of the intestinal microflora.  The bacteria works by increasing the population of beneficial anaerobic bacteria while simultaneously decreasing potentially harmful microorganisms in the gut.  This leads to a reduction in luminal endotoxin, potentially minimizing endotoxin or bacterial translocation.  Essentially, it helps normalize the gut's bacterial environment.  While its primary use is in treating diarrhea, research continues to explore its potential applications in other gastrointestinal conditions.

### Dosage
The dosage of Bacillus mesentericus varies depending on the specific formulation and the severity of the condition.  Typical dosages range from 0.25 to 15 million colony-forming units (CFU), with a common dose being around 1 million CFU.  The medication is usually administered orally.  Precise dosing should always be determined and supervised by a healthcare professional who can consider individual patient factors.  Information regarding pediatric dosing or specific administration for children is not readily available; always consult with a doctor before giving this to children. There are no readily available dosage forms besides oral formulations.

### Side Effects
Common side effects associated with Bacillus mesentericus are generally mild and often resolve on their own. These include:

* Gas
* Bloating
* Abdominal discomfort
* Flatulence
* Nausea

While rare, more serious side effects are possible.  If any unusual or concerning symptoms develop, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Bacillus mesentericus works by altering the composition of the gut microbiome. It produces enzymes like amylase and protease, which support the growth of beneficial bacteria.  Simultaneously, it inhibits the growth of several pathogenic bacteria, including *Escherichia coli*, *Clostridium perfringens*, *Salmonella typhi*, *Vibrio parahaemolyticus*, *Campylobacter*, and *Yersinia enterocolitica*. By promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and suppressing harmful ones, Bacillus mesentericus helps restore the balance of the intestinal flora, contributing to improved gut health and the resolution of diarrheal symptoms.  It also plays a role in regulating gut motility.


### Precautions
Before starting treatment with Bacillus mesentericus, it's important to inform your healthcare provider about any pre-existing medical conditions, allergies, or medications you are currently taking.  Interactions with other medications are generally not well-documented, but it's always best to disclose all medications to avoid potential unforeseen consequences.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using this probiotic.  The safety and efficacy of Bacillus mesentericus in children have not been extensively studied, hence medical advice is critical before administering it to children.  As with any medication, appropriate storage conditions should be followed to maintain its effectiveness.
