# Bepridil
### Generic Name
Bepridil

### Usage
Bepridil is primarily used to treat angina pectoris (chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart).  It's a calcium channel blocker, working to relax blood vessels and improve blood flow to the heart, thus alleviating angina symptoms.  While its primary use is for angina, it's crucial to understand that bepridil is not a first-line treatment and its use should be guided by a physician due to potential side effects and drug interactions.

### Dosage
Dosage for adults with angina pectoris is typically started at 200 mg once daily.  This may be increased to 300 mg once daily after 10 days if necessary, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. The minimum effective dose is established at 200mg/day.  Elderly patients start at the same dose, but may require closer monitoring.  There is no established safe and effective dosage for children.

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  A physician should determine the appropriate dosage reduction based on the individual's condition and response to treatment.  Bepridil is usually administered orally as a tablet.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of bepridil can include:

* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Edema (swelling)
* Palpitations
* QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm)
* Headache
* Drowsiness
*  Gastrointestinal disturbances


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Congestive heart failure
* Nervousness
* Psychiatric disturbances
* Insomnia
* Rash
* Sexual dysfunction
* Tremor
*  Paraesthesias (numbness or tingling)
* Blurred vision
* Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
*  Serious arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes, a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)


**If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works
Bepridil is a non-selective calcium channel blocker. This means it affects both slow (L-type) and fast calcium channels in the heart and blood vessels.  By inhibiting the influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle, it causes relaxation of blood vessels, decreasing the workload on the heart and improving blood flow. This helps reduce chest pain associated with angina.  It also interacts with calmodulin, another calcium-binding protein involved in muscle contraction.

### Precautions
Bepridil is contraindicated (absolutely not to be used) in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to bepridil or any of its components
* History of serious ventricular or atrial arrhythmias
* Uncompensated cardiac insufficiency (severe heart failure)
* Congenital QT interval prolongation


Use with caution in patients with:

* History of idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis
* Second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block
* Cardiogenic shock
* Congestive heart failure
* Significant hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Severe left ventricular dysfunction
* Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (especially obstructive)
* Concomitant therapy with beta-blockers or digoxin
* Edema
* Increased intracranial pressure (e.g., from brain tumors)
* Renal or hepatic impairment
* Elderly patients


Bepridil may interact with many other drugs, including beta-blockers, digoxin,  carbamazepine, cyclosporine, theophylline, quinidine, fentanyl, amprenavir, ritonavir, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and cisapride.  The risk of toxicity increases when used with certain drugs that prolong the QT interval.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking before starting bepridil.  Bepridil should be taken with food. Abrupt withdrawal may cause chest pain.


Pregnancy Category C:  Bepridil is excreted in breast milk. The decision to discontinue breastfeeding or the medication should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, considering the potential risks to the infant.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking bepridil suddenly?**  A: No, abrupt discontinuation may lead to a recurrence or worsening of angina. Always consult your doctor before stopping treatment.

* **Q: How should I store bepridil?** A: Store bepridil as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is bepridil suitable for everyone with angina?** A: No.  Bepridil is not a first-line treatment for angina due to its potential side effects and interactions.  Your doctor will assess your suitability for this medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I suspect an overdose?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Overdose can be serious.
