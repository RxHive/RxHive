# Betamethasone + Mupirocin

**Generic Name:** Betamethasone and Mupirocin

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid (betamethasone) and an antibiotic (mupirocin) used to treat skin infections that are both inflamed and infected with bacteria.  It's typically prescribed for conditions like impetigo, eczema complicated by a bacterial infection, or other skin infections involving both inflammation and bacterial colonization.  It is applied directly to the affected skin area.  **Important Note:**  This medication is only for topical use and should never be ingested. Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding application frequency and duration of treatment.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site.  They can include:

* **Burning, stinging, or itching:**  These are common initial reactions.
* **Skin thinning (atrophy):**  Prolonged use can lead to skin thinning, especially with potent corticosteroids like betamethasone.
* **Skin dryness:**  This is a relatively common side effect.
* **Stretch marks (striae):**  Possible with long-term use.
* **Increased skin sensitivity:**  Making the skin more susceptible to irritation.
* **Acne-like rash:** In rare cases.
* **Allergic contact dermatitis:** An allergic reaction to the medication.


**How it Works:**

* **Betamethasone:** This is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response in the skin.  It helps to decrease redness, swelling, and discomfort associated with the infection.

* **Mupirocin:** This is an antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, effectively killing bacteria like *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococcus pyogenes* which are common causes of skin infections.

The combination of betamethasone and mupirocin provides both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial actions, addressing both the inflammation and the infection simultaneously.
