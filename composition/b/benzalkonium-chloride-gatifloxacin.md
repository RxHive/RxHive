# Benzalkonium Chloride + Gatifloxacin

**Generic Name:** Benzalkonium Chloride and Gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution

**Usage:**

This combination medication is used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye) in adults and children 1 year of age and older.  Benzalkonium chloride is a preservative that helps prevent bacterial contamination of the eye drops. Gatifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that kills bacteria responsible for the infection.  It's crucial to only use this medication as prescribed by a doctor.  Do not use it for other eye conditions or infections.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye(s)
* Temporary blurry vision
* Eye redness or irritation
* Discomfort or dryness in the eye(s)


Less common but more serious side effects require immediate medical attention and include:

* Severe eye pain
* Vision changes (beyond temporary blurriness)
* Increased eye discharge
* Eyelid swelling
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing)


This list is not exhaustive, and other side effects may occur. Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning symptoms.


**How it Works:**

Benzalkonium chloride acts as a preservative, preventing the growth of microorganisms in the eye drop solution. Gatifloxacin, the active antibacterial agent, works by interfering with the bacterial DNA replication and repair mechanisms.  This inhibits the growth and kills susceptible bacteria causing the conjunctivitis.
