# Beclometasone + Econazole + Gentamicin

**Generic Name:** Beclometasone dipropionate + Econazole nitrate + Gentamicin sulfate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat otitis externa (swimmer's ear), an infection of the outer ear canal.  It combines a corticosteroid (beclometasone), an antifungal (econazole), and an antibiotic (gentamicin) to address inflammation, fungal infections (like *Candida*), and bacterial infections that may be present. It's important to note that this combination isn't suitable for all types of ear infections and a doctor should always diagnose the condition before prescribing it.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity, but common potential side effects include:

* **Ear:** Burning, stinging, itching, or irritation in the ear canal.
* **Local effects from Beclometasone:** Skin thinning, skin discoloration, striae (stretch marks), delayed wound healing. These are less likely with short-term ear use.
* **Local effects from Gentamicin:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).  Prolonged use may lead to the growth of resistant bacteria or fungi.
* **Systemic effects (rare but possible with prolonged use or misuse):**  These are unlikely with ear drops but can include increased blood sugar levels, Cushing's syndrome-like effects (from the corticosteroid), hearing loss (from the gentamicin).


**How it Works:**

* **Beclometasone dipropionate:** A corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and swelling in the ear canal. This helps alleviate pain and itching.
* **Econazole nitrate:** An antifungal agent that kills or inhibits the growth of fungi, particularly *Candida albicans*, a common cause of fungal otitis externa.
* **Gentamicin sulfate:** An aminoglycoside antibiotic that kills or inhibits the growth of various bacteria that cause ear infections.  The combination provides broad-spectrum coverage against both bacterial and fungal pathogens often involved in swimmer's ear.
