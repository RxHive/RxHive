# Bendamustine

**Generic Name:** Bendamustine hydrochloride

**Usage:** Bendamustine is a chemotherapy medication used to treat certain types of cancer.  Its primary uses include:

* **Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL):** Often used in combination with rituximab (Rituxan) for previously untreated CLL and as a single agent or in combination with other drugs for relapsed or refractory CLL.
* **Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL):**  Used in similar ways to its use in CLL, often for relapsed or refractory cases.
* **Other types of lymphoma:**  May be used off-label in other lymphoma subtypes.  The specific use will depend on the type and stage of cancer and the patient's overall health.  Always consult with an oncologist.

**Side Effects:**  Bendamustine, like other chemotherapy drugs, can cause a range of side effects, varying in severity from person to person.  Some common side effects include:

* **Low blood cell counts:** This includes neutropenia (low neutrophils, increasing infection risk), thrombocytopenia (low platelets, increasing bleeding risk), and anemia (low red blood cells, causing fatigue).
* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are common side effects that can often be managed with antiemetic medications.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak is a frequently reported side effect.
* **Hair loss (alopecia):**  This is often temporary and hair usually grows back after treatment ends.
* **Constipation or diarrhea:** Changes in bowel habits are possible.
* **Mouth sores (mucositis):**  Painful sores in the mouth and throat.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:** Numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet.
* **Infections:**  Due to the suppressed immune system.
* **Liver toxicity:** Elevated liver enzymes are possible, requiring monitoring.
* **Kidney problems:**  May require adjustment of dosage.
* **Allergic reactions:** Though rare, severe allergic reactions are possible.


**How it Works:** Bendamustine is an alkylating agent and purine analog.  It works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, preventing them from dividing and growing.  It's considered an alkylating agent because it adds alkyl groups to the DNA, causing damage and ultimately cell death.  The purine analog aspect also interferes with DNA synthesis and function.
