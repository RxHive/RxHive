# Bupivacaine (Liposomal)
### Generic Name
Bupivacaine (Liposomal)

### Usage
Bupivacaine liposomal is a long-acting local anesthetic used primarily for postsurgical pain management in adults.  Its main applications are infiltration anesthesia for procedures like bunionectomy and hemorrhoidectomy, and as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block for regional analgesia following total shoulder arthroplasty or rotator cuff repair.  It's crucial to note that the liposomal formulation is *not* bioequivalent to standard bupivacaine hydrochloride; therefore, dose conversions between them are impossible.  The safety and effectiveness of liposomal bupivacaine haven't been established for nerve blocks other than the interscalene brachial plexus block.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  The dosage varies significantly depending on the procedure and administration method.

* **Postsurgical analgesia (infiltration):**
    * **Bunionectomy:** A single dose of 7 mL undiluted liposomal bupivacaine infiltrated around the osteotomy, plus 1 mL subcutaneously at the surgical site (total 8 mL, 106 mg).
    * **Hemorrhoidectomy:**  A single dose of 20 mL liposomal bupivacaine (diluted to 30 mL with 10 mL normal saline) administered in six 5 mL injections around the anal sphincter (total 20 mL, 266 mg).

* **Postsurgical regional analgesia (interscalene brachial plexus nerve block):** A single dose of 10 mL (133 mg) is administered.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of liposomal bupivacaine have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic or renal impairment by the manufacturer. However, caution is advised in patients with severe impairment because reduced metabolism and elimination could increase systemic exposure and the risk of adverse effects.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (incidence >10%): motor dysfunction, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and fever.

Side effects with incidence between 1-10% include a wide range of neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, dermatological, genitourinary, hematological, hepatic, hypersensitivity, local, neuromuscular/skeletal, ophthalmic, otic, and respiratory effects.  See the detailed list in the provided {details} section for specifics.

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include paralysis, seizures, and methemoglobinemia (a serious blood disorder).  Any concerning adverse effect warrants immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Liposomal bupivacaine works by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses.  It decreases the permeability of the neuronal membrane to sodium ions, preventing depolarization and thus inhibiting nerve conduction, resulting in localized pain relief. The liposomal formulation allows for sustained release and prolonged pain relief compared to standard bupivacaine.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Liposomal bupivacaine is contraindicated for obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia due to the risk of fetal bradycardia and death.
* **Warnings:** Increased risks exist for CNS and cardiovascular toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, intra-articular infusion-related chondrolysis, methemoglobinemia, respiratory arrest, and seizures.
* **Use with caution:**  Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Liposomal bupivacaine may interact with other medications.  Specifically, it can decrease the effectiveness of technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept, increase the effects of neuromuscular-blocking agents, and have its effects altered by other local anesthetics, bupivacaine itself, hyaluronidase, and methemoglobinemia-inducing agents.
* **Administration:**  Liposomal bupivacaine should be injected slowly, using a fine-gauge needle with frequent aspiration to avoid intravascular injection. It should not be administered epidurally, intrathecally, intravascularly, intra-articularly (except in specific, approved regional nerve block procedures), or for preincisional/preprocedural techniques requiring deep sensory block. Avoid contact with antiseptics.  Avoid administering other local anesthetics within 96 hours.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the pain relief last?** A:  The duration of analgesia varies depending on the dose, site of injection, and individual patient factors, but it's generally longer-lasting than other local anesthetics.

* **Q: Can I take other pain medications with liposomal bupivacaine?** A: Discuss all medications with your doctor or pharmacist to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any side effects to your healthcare provider immediately.  Serious side effects require immediate medical attention.

* **Q: How should I store liposomal bupivacaine?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the product packaging.

* **Q: Is liposomal bupivacaine safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: Consult your doctor to carefully weigh the risks and benefits as it's contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical blocks and is excreted in breast milk.
