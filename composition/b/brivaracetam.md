# Brivaracetam
### Generic Name
Brivaracetam

### Usage
Brivaracetam is an anticonvulsant medication primarily used as an adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in adults and adolescents aged 16 and older with epilepsy.  This means it's used *in addition* to other seizure medications, not as a standalone treatment. While its primary use is for partial-onset seizures,  research is ongoing to explore its potential effectiveness in other types of epilepsy.

### Dosage

**Adults (≥16 years):**

* **Partial-onset seizures:** The usual starting dose is 50 mg twice daily (BID), either orally (tablet or solution) or intravenously (IV).  The dose can be adjusted, based on individual response and tolerability, to a range of 25 mg BID to 100 mg BID. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg. IV administration is typically for short-term use (no longer than 4 consecutive days) when oral administration is temporarily not feasible.

**Children (4 to <16 years):**

Dosage for children is determined by weight and is administered orally.  Safety and efficacy haven't been established for children under 4.  Always follow a physician's precise instructions as dosage is weight-based and individualized. Examples:

* **11 to <20 kg:** Initial dose 0.5–1.25 mg/kg/dose BID, adjusted to 0.5–2.5 mg/kg BID; maximum 5 mg/kg/day.
* **20 to <50 kg:** Initial dose 0.5–1 mg/kg/dose BID, adjusted to 0.5–2 mg/kg BID; maximum 4 mg/kg/day.
* **≥50 kg:** Initial dose 25–50 mg BID, adjusted to 25–100 mg BID; maximum 200 mg/day.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Individuals with mild to severe liver impairment may require a reduced starting dose of 25 mg BID, with a maximum of 75 mg BID.
* **Renal Impairment:** Generally, no dosage adjustment is needed for those with mild to severe kidney impairment; however, it's not recommended for individuals with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis.
* **Rifampin Concomitant Therapy:** If taking rifampin concurrently, the brivaracetam dosage may need to be increased by up to 100%.

**Important Note:**  Never abruptly stop taking brivaracetam.  Always reduce the dosage gradually under the supervision of a healthcare provider to minimize the risk of increased seizure frequency.

### How it Works

The exact mechanism of brivaracetam's anti-seizure action isn't fully understood. However, it's known to bind strongly to a protein in the brain called synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A).  This interaction is thought to play a crucial role in its ability to reduce seizure activity, though the precise pathway is still under investigation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Brivaracetam is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to brivaracetam or any of its components.
* **Interactions:** Brivaracetam can interact with other medications, including alcohol, opioids, and certain other anticonvulsants, potentially increasing the risk of side effects.  Always inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Brivaracetam is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus haven't been fully established.  The decision to use during pregnancy should be made carefully, weighing the benefits against potential risks.  It's also unknown whether brivaracetam is excreted in breast milk.
* **Specific Populations:**  Caution is advised in patients with hepatic impairment.  Brivaracetam is not recommended for those with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis.
* **Suicidal Ideation:**  There is an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with anticonvulsant medications, including brivaracetam.  Close monitoring is necessary, particularly during initial treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take brivaracetam with food?** A: Yes, it can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store brivaracetam?** A: Store tablets and oral solution as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I drive while taking brivaracetam?** A:  Because drowsiness and dizziness are potential side effects, it's important to avoid activities requiring alertness, such as driving or operating machinery, until you know how this medication affects you.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Never double up on doses.  Contact your doctor if you have concerns about missed doses.

* **Q: Can I stop taking brivaracetam suddenly?** A: No.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually reducing the dosage to avoid potential complications like increased seizure frequency.
