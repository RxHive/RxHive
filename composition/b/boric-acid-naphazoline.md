# Boric Acid + Naphazoline
### Generic Name
Boric Acid + Naphazoline

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used as a topical ophthalmic solution to treat eye irritation and redness.  Boric acid acts as a mild antiseptic, helping to cleanse the eye and reduce the risk of infection. Naphazoline is a sympathomimetic decongestant that constricts blood vessels in the eye, reducing redness and swelling.  It's commonly used for temporary relief from symptoms associated with minor eye irritations such as allergies, conjunctivitis (pink eye â€“ although it doesn't treat the underlying cause), or exposure to irritants like dust or smoke.  It's important to note that this combination does *not* treat the underlying cause of eye irritation; it only provides symptomatic relief.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific product formulation.  Always follow the directions on the product label carefully.  Generally, for adults and children over 12, one or two drops are instilled into the affected eye(s) as needed, typically up to four times daily.  **This medication is not generally recommended for children under 12 years old without specific guidance from a pediatrician or ophthalmologist.**  Never exceed the recommended dosage.  If symptoms persist or worsen after a few days, or if new symptoms develop, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.

There are no intravenous (IV) formulations of boric acid and naphazoline for ophthalmic use. This medication is solely for topical application to the eyes.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation upon application
* Temporary blurred vision
* Eye dryness
* Mild discomfort

Less common, but more serious side effects that warrant immediate medical attention include:

* Severe eye pain
* Vision changes that persist
* Increased eye redness or swelling
* Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling)

If any of these or other unusual side effects occur, stop using the medication and seek medical advice.


### How it Works

Boric acid's action in this combination is primarily as a mild antiseptic. It helps to create a clean environment in the eye, reducing the potential for infection, especially if irritation is caused by bacteria or foreign debris.  Naphazoline works by constricting blood vessels in the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelid and covering the white part of the eye). This constriction reduces blood flow to the area, resulting in less redness and swelling.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant. The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.
* **Contact Lenses:**  Remove contact lenses before applying the eye drops. Wait at least 15 minutes after application before reinserting lenses.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all other medications you are currently taking, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Interactions with other medications are generally uncommon but are possible.
* **Glaucoma:**  Individuals with glaucoma or a history of glaucoma should use this medication with caution, as it may increase intraocular pressure.  Consult your ophthalmologist before use.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Discontinue use immediately and seek medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.
* **Long-term Use:** Prolonged use of naphazoline can lead to rebound congestion, making the redness and irritation worse.  It should be used only for short periods, as directed on the label.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The redness-reducing effects of naphazoline are usually seen within a few minutes.
* **Q: Can I use this medication for dry eyes?** A: While it may temporarily relieve discomfort associated with dry eyes due to its mild antiseptic properties, it's not specifically designed to treat dry eyes and may worsen the dryness in some cases due to the decongestant effect. Dedicated dry eye treatments are more appropriate.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the medication at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q: Can I use this in both eyes if only one is affected?** A: Follow the label instructions. If the product label does not specify whether you can use it in both eyes if only one is irritated, consult your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get too much in my eye?** A:  Rinse your eye with plenty of cool water and contact your healthcare provider if you experience any discomfort or adverse effects.
