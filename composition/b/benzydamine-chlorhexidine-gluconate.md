* **Taste alteration:** Temporary changes in taste perception.

**How it Works:**

* **Benzydamine hydrochloride:** This is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic (pain-relieving) and anti-inflammatory properties. It works by reducing inflammation and pain in the affected area.

* **Chlorhexidine gluconate:** This is a broad-spectrum antiseptic that kills bacteria and reduces the number of microorganisms in the mouth. This helps to prevent or reduce infection and promotes healing.
