# Benzydamine + Chlorhexidine Gluconate
### Generic Name
Benzydamine + Chlorhexidine Gluconate


### Usage

Benzydamine and Chlorhexidine Gluconate is a combination medication typically used as a topical oral rinse or spray for the treatment of mouth and throat infections.  Its primary use is to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions affecting the oral cavity. These include:

* **Sore throats:**  Including those caused by viral or bacterial infections, or irritation.
* **Mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcers):**  Reducing pain and promoting healing.
* **Gingivitis (gum inflammation):** Helping to reduce inflammation and discomfort.
* **Post-surgical oral pain:** Following dental procedures or oral surgery.
* **Oral thrush (candidiasis):** Though often used as an adjunct to antifungal treatment.

It's important to note that this combination is not a replacement for antibiotics or antifungal medications in serious infections. It primarily provides symptomatic relief and helps create a more favorable environment for healing.  Always consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment of underlying infections.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary depending on the specific product formulation (mouthwash, spray) and the manufacturer. Always follow the instructions printed on the product label.  Generally:

**Adults and Children over 12 years:**  The typical recommendation involves using the solution as a rinse or gargle.  A common dosage is 15-30ml of solution, swished around the mouth and throat for 30-60 seconds, then spat out.  This is usually repeated 2-3 times daily.

**Children under 12 years:**  Use in children under 12 should only be undertaken under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional.  Lower doses or different formulations may be necessary.  Never administer medication to children without consulting a doctor or pharmacist.

**IV Administration:** Benzydamine and Chlorhexidine Gluconate are not administered intravenously (IV).  This combination is for topical use only in the mouth and throat.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Temporary tingling or burning sensation in the mouth.
* Slight staining of teeth (temporary).
* Altered taste sensation.
* Dry mouth.

Less common but more serious side effects are rare but could include allergic reactions such as rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if any serious allergic reaction occurs.


### How it Works

Benzydamine acts as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), reducing pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.  Chlorhexidine gluconate is a powerful antiseptic that kills a wide range of bacteria and fungi, thus reducing the microbial load in the mouth and throat and helping to prevent further infection.  The combination provides both pain relief and infection control, promoting healing.


### Precautions

* **Allergic reactions:** Individuals with known allergies to benzydamine, chlorhexidine, or any other components of the formulation should avoid using this medication.
* **Drug interactions:** Although interactions are relatively uncommon, it's essential to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered after careful evaluation of the benefits and risks by a healthcare professional.
* **Children:**  Use in children under 12 is generally not recommended except under strict medical supervision.
* **Dental work:** Avoid using the rinse immediately before or after dental procedures, as it might interfere with the healing process.
* **Long-term use:** Prolonged use may lead to alterations in the oral flora, potentially leading to fungal overgrowth.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I swallow the rinse?** A: No, this medication is for topical use only. Swallowing it could lead to unwanted side effects.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: You may notice relief from pain and inflammation within a short time, but the full therapeutic effect may take several days.
* **Q: Can I use this rinse for toothache pain?** A: While it may help relieve some associated discomfort, it's crucial to consult a dentist for the underlying toothache cause.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  If side effects are mild, you may only need to discontinue use. For more serious or persistent side effects, consult a doctor immediately.
