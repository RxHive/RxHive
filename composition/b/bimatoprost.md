# Bimatoprost
### Generic Name
Bimatoprost

### Usage

Bimatoprost is primarily used to treat open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.  It lowers intraocular pressure (IOP), the pressure inside the eye.  Elevated IOP is a major risk factor for these conditions, which can lead to vision loss if left untreated.  Bimatoprost achieves this by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor, the fluid that nourishes the eye.

Beyond its ophthalmic uses, bimatoprost is also used off-label to promote eyelash growth in individuals with hypotrichosis (sparse eyelashes). This effect is due to bimatoprost's ability to prolong the growth phase of hair follicles.


### Dosage

**Ophthalmic Use (for glaucoma and ocular hypertension):**

* **Adults:**  The typical dose is one drop of 0.01% or 0.03% solution in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.  Applying the medication more frequently than prescribed may decrease its effectiveness. If used with other eye drops, administer them at least 5 minutes apart.
* **Children â‰¥16 years:** The dosage is the same as for adults.  Bimatoprost is generally not recommended for children under 16 unless specifically directed by an ophthalmologist.

**Hypotrichosis of the Eyelashes:**

* **Adults:** Apply one drop of 0.03% solution along the upper eyelid at the base of the eyelashes once daily before bedtime.  Repeat for the other eye if necessary.

**Important Note:**  The dosage and formulation (solution, implant) will vary depending on the specific condition being treated and the physician's recommendations.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  These occur in more than 10% of patients:

* Conjunctival hyperemia (redness of the eye)
* Changes in eyelash appearance (growth, darkening, thickening)
* Itching of the eye

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Eye irritation
* Allergic conjunctivitis
* Iris hyperpigmentation (darkening of the iris)
* Macular edema (swelling of the macula, the central part of the retina)
* Bacterial keratitis (infection of the cornea)


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Bimatoprost is a prostaglandin analog. It works by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor from the eye, thereby reducing intraocular pressure. This mechanism is particularly effective in reducing pressure in the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral pathways. The mechanism for eyelash growth involves increasing the hair follicle growth phase duration and increasing the proportion of hair follicles in the growth phase.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Bimatoprost is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to bimatoprost or any component of the formulation.  Additional contraindications exist for the implant formulation (see a healthcare professional).

* **Interactions:**  The use of bimatoprost with other prostaglandin analogs (such as latanoprost or travoprost) may increase the risk of elevated IOP or other side effects.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Bimatoprost is a category C drug during pregnancy.  The safety of bimatoprost during breastfeeding is not fully established. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using bimatoprost if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Other Precautions:** Use caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation, aphakia (absence of the eye lens), or pseudophakia (presence of an artificial eye lens).  Remove contact lenses before applying bimatoprost and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for bimatoprost to work?** A: For glaucoma and ocular hypertension, a reduction in IOP is usually seen within several weeks.  For eyelash growth, visible results may take several months.

* **Q: Can I stop using bimatoprost suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop using bimatoprost without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation may cause a rebound increase in IOP.

* **Q: How should I store bimatoprost?** A: Store bimatoprost at room temperature, away from direct light and moisture.

* **Q: Is bimatoprost safe for long-term use?** A: Bimatoprost is generally considered safe for long-term use, but regular monitoring by your ophthalmologist is essential.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not apply a double dose.
