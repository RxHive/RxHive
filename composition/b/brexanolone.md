# Brexanolone
### Generic Name
Brexanolone

### Usage
Brexanolone is primarily used to treat postpartum depression (PPD) in adult women.  It's a significant treatment option for this specific condition, offering a targeted approach to alleviate the symptoms associated with PPD.  Currently, there are no approved uses for brexanolone outside of postpartum depression.

### Dosage
Brexanolone is administered intravenously (IV) as a continuous 60-hour infusion.  The dosage is individualized based on body weight, and the infusion rate is adjusted over the 60-hour period. The typical regimen involves a gradual increase in the infusion rate over the first 24 hours, followed by a period of maintenance, and then a gradual decrease in the rate before the infusion ends. The exact schedule is as follows:


* **Hours 0-4:** 30 mcg/kg/hour
* **Hours 4-24:** 60 mcg/kg/hour
* **Hours 24-52:** 90 mcg/kg/hour (may be reduced to 60 mcg/kg/hour based on tolerability)
* **Hours 52-56:** 60 mcg/kg/hour
* **Hours 56-60:** 30 mcg/kg/hour

**Important Note:** The infusion must be initiated early enough in the day to allow for monitoring for excessive sedation.  Brexanolone is not currently approved for use in children or adolescents, and its safety and effectiveness in these populations haven't been established.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment may also be necessary and should be determined in consultation with a healthcare professional.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Drowsiness
* Sedation
* Dizziness
* Vertigo
* Presyncope (a feeling of fainting)
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)

Less common side effects (1-10% of patients) include:

* Loss of consciousness
* Flushing
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Diarrhea
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Hot flashes
* Oropharyngeal pain


Rare side effects (<1% of patients):

* Impaired consciousness


**Serious side effects:**  Excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness are serious risks and necessitate immediate cessation of the infusion.  Seek immediate medical attention if these or any other concerning side effects occur.


### How it Works
Brexanolone is a neuroactive steroid that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.  While the exact mechanism in treating PPD isn't fully understood, it's believed that its interaction with these receptors in the brain helps restore a balance of neurotransmitters, ultimately leading to the alleviation of depressive symptoms. GABA is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in regulating neuronal excitability. By modulating GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, brexanolone influences the activity of brain cells, thereby impacting mood and emotional regulation.

### Precautions

* **Excessive Sedation and Loss of Consciousness:**  This is a significant risk associated with brexanolone, and patients must be carefully monitored during infusion and afterward.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Brexanolone may cause fetal harm, and excretion in breast milk is a concern. The decision to breastfeed during or after treatment should be made carefully in consultation with a healthcare professional.
* **Drug Interactions:** Brexanolone can interact with numerous other medications, including CNS depressants, opioids, and other substances that affect the central nervous system.  Always inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors:** Patients with a history of suicidal ideation or attempts require close monitoring during and after treatment.
* **Substance Abuse:**  Brexanolone carries a risk of abuse and dependence and should be used cautiously in individuals with a history of substance abuse.
