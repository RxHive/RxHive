# Bloodroot
### Generic Name
Bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis)

### Usage
Bloodroot, specifically its alkaloid sanguinarine, has historically been used for various purposes, though its use is now largely discouraged due to toxicity concerns.  Historically, it was employed as an emetic (to induce vomiting) and as a purported means of cleansing the body of toxins.  Sanguinarine has also seen limited use as an antiplaque agent in some dental products like toothpaste and mouthwash.  However, it's crucial to note that the FDA considers bloodroot unsafe for use in foods, beverages, or drugs.  Its past use as an expectorant (to help loosen and expel phlegm) has been discontinued due to safety concerns.

### Dosage
There is no safe or recommended dosage for bloodroot due to its toxicity.  Its use in any form, whether as a tincture, extract, or in any other preparation, is strongly discouraged.  Any historical uses mentioned here should not be considered safe or effective modern medical practices.

### Side Effects
Due to the toxicity of bloodroot, even small amounts can cause a wide range of adverse effects. These include but are not limited to:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Severe stomach upset
* Burning sensation in the mouth and throat
* Skin irritation and allergic reactions (contact dermatitis)
* Liver damage
* Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
* Seizures
* Respiratory problems

Serious side effects are possible, and death is a potential consequence of ingestion or significant skin contact.

### How it Works
The precise mechanism of bloodroot's action is not fully understood.  The main active component, sanguinarine, is known to cause irritation to mucous membranes, explaining its emetic effects (inducing vomiting).  Its antiplaque action in dental products is attributed to its ability to kill bacteria, though this effect is also associated with potential toxicity.  Bloodroot's historical use in other contexts lacks robust scientific evidence and is not supported by modern medical practice.

### Precautions
**Bloodroot is highly toxic and should never be ingested or used internally.**  Avoid all contact with the plant, especially its sap, which can cause skin irritation.  If accidental ingestion or skin contact occurs, seek immediate medical attention.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should absolutely avoid any contact with bloodroot. There are no safe uses of bloodroot, and it should not be considered for any medicinal purpose.  Its use in traditional medicine should be regarded as unsafe and outdated.
