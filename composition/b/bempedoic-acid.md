# Bempedoic acid
### Generic Name
Bempedoic acid

### Usage
Bempedoic acid is used to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), often referred to as "bad" cholesterol.  It's prescribed as an add-on therapy to a statin medication for adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (a genetic condition causing high cholesterol) or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (hardening of the arteries) who need further LDL-C reduction despite already taking the maximum tolerated dose of a statin.  The primary goal is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events associated with high cholesterol.  It is not a first-line treatment for high cholesterol.


### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical dosage is 180 mg once daily, taken orally. This is always in *addition* to a statin medication, at the highest tolerated dose.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of bempedoic acid in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are routinely recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However,  for those with severe hepatic or renal impairment, including those on dialysis,  dosage adjustments are not provided in the manufacturer's labeling and should be discussed with a doctor.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Gout and hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels)

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat)
* Increased serum creatine kinase (a marker of muscle damage)
* Abdominal pain or distress
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate)
* Anemia, leukopenia (low white blood cell count), or thrombocythemia (high platelet count)
* Increased liver enzymes (AST, ALT)
* Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (kidney function markers)
* Back pain, limb pain, muscle spasms
* Upper respiratory tract infections


**Rare Side Effects (occurring in less than 1% of patients):**

* Tendon rupture


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the more serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Bempedoic acid works by inhibiting adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme involved in cholesterol production in the liver. By blocking ACL, bempedoic acid reduces the liver's ability to make cholesterol. This leads to a decrease in LDL-C levels in the blood, primarily through an increase in the number of LDL receptors in the liver, which help remove LDL-C from the bloodstream.  Its active metabolite, ESP15228, contributes to this effect.


### Precautions

* **Drug Interactions:** Bempedoic acid can interact with other medications, particularly statins like simvastatin and pravastatin. Concomitant use may increase the levels of these statins, potentially raising the risk of muscle problems (myopathy).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Bempedoic acid should be discontinued if pregnancy occurs as it may harm the fetus.  It is not known whether bempedoic acid is excreted in breast milk, therefore breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment.
* **Hyperuricemia and Gout:**  Bempedoic acid can increase uric acid levels, potentially leading to or worsening gout.  Monitoring uric acid levels may be necessary.
* **Tendon Rupture:**  There is an increased risk of tendon rupture, though rare.
* **Liver and Kidney Function:** While dosage adjustments aren't usually needed for mild to moderate liver or kidney problems, patients with severe issues should be monitored closely by their physician.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take bempedoic acid with food?**
A: Yes, bempedoic acid can be taken with or without food.

**Q: How long does it take to see results?**
A:  Significant reductions in LDL-C are usually seen within 8-12 weeks of starting treatment.

**Q:  Is bempedoic acid a replacement for statins?**
A: No, bempedoic acid is an *adjunct* therapy. It's used *in addition* to statins, not instead of them.

**Q: How should I store bempedoic acid?**
A: Follow the storage instructions on the medication label. Generally, it's best stored at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
