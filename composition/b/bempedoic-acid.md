# Bempedoic acid

**Generic Name:** Bempedoic acid

**Usage:** Bempedoic acid is used to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, or "bad" cholesterol) in adults with hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) who cannot tolerate statins or who need additional lowering of LDL-C despite maximum tolerated statin therapy. It's often used in combination with statins or other cholesterol-lowering medications.


**Side Effects:**  The most common side effects of bempedoic acid include:

* **Muscle aches and pains (myalgia):**  While less common than with statins, muscle pain is still a possibility.
* **Joint pain (arthralgia):** Similar to muscle pain, joint pain can occur.
* **Uric acid increase (hyperuricemia):** This can lead to gout in susceptible individuals.
* **Nausea, diarrhea, and constipation:** Gastrointestinal upset is relatively common.
* **Upper respiratory tract infections:** These are frequently reported.
* **Back pain:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Dizziness:**

Serious side effects are less frequent but include pancreatitis and liver problems.  It's important to report any unusual symptoms to your doctor immediately.


**How it Works:** Bempedoic acid inhibits an enzyme called ATP-citrate lyase (ACL).  ACL is involved in the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. By inhibiting ACL, bempedoic acid reduces the production of cholesterol in the liver, leading to lower LDL-C levels in the blood.  It works differently than statins, which inhibit a different enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway (HMG-CoA reductase). This different mechanism of action is why it can be used in patients who cannot tolerate statins.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is bempedoic acid as effective as statins?** A:  Bempedoic acid is not as potent as statins in lowering LDL-C, but it offers a valuable option for those who cannot take statins or need additional cholesterol reduction beyond what statins provide.

* **Q: Can I take bempedoic acid with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting bempedoic acid.  Interactions are possible.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of bempedoic acid?** A: Long-term studies are ongoing to fully understand the long-term effects.  Currently available data suggests a relatively safe profile in the long-term, but monitoring is still necessary.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  It may take several weeks to see a significant reduction in LDL-C levels.

* **Q:  Can bempedoic acid cause liver damage?** A: Liver damage is a rare but possible side effect. Your doctor will likely monitor your liver function through blood tests.

* **Q: Is bempedoic acid suitable for everyone with high cholesterol?** A:  No. Bempedoic acid is not appropriate for all individuals with high cholesterol. Your doctor will assess your specific needs and health status to determine if it's the right treatment for you.
