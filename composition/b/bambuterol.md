# Bambuterol
### Generic Name
Bambuterol

### Usage
Bambuterol is a long-acting beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist used primarily as maintenance therapy for bronchial asthma and reversible airway obstruction.  This includes conditions like chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It's crucial to understand that Bambuterol is *not* intended for the treatment of acute bronchospasm; it's for managing ongoing symptoms.  For asthma control, it should always be used in conjunction with optimal anti-inflammatory therapy, such as corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists, and never as a monotherapy.

### Dosage

**Adults (Bronchial asthma and/or reversible airway obstruction):**  Bambuterol should be taken orally at bedtime. Dosage depends on prior tolerance to beta-2 agonists:

* **Patients without demonstrated tolerance:** Start with 10 mg once daily (OD). This can be increased to 20 mg OD after one to two weeks if needed.
* **Patients with demonstrated tolerance:**  Start and maintain at 20 mg OD at bedtime.

**Children (Bronchial asthma and/or reversible airway obstruction):**  Dosage varies by age and ethnicity and should be administered orally at bedtime.  Like adults, Bambuterol is for maintenance therapy and not acute bronchospasm. It's crucial to use this in combination with anti-inflammatory therapy.

* **Non-Asian children:**
    * Ages 2 to under 6 years: 10 mg OD.
    * Ages 6 and older (without prior beta-2 agonist tolerance): Start at 10 mg OD; increase to 20 mg OD after 1-2 weeks if needed.
    * Ages 6 and older (with prior beta-2 agonist tolerance): 20 mg OD.
* **Asian children:**
    * Ages 2 to under 6 years: 5 mg OD.
    * Ages 6-12 years: Start at 5 mg OD; increase to 10 mg OD after 1-2 weeks if needed.
    * Adolescents (without prior beta-2 agonist tolerance): Start at 10 mg OD; increase to 20 mg OD after 1-2 weeks if needed.
    * Adolescents (with prior beta-2 agonist tolerance): 20 mg OD.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments; however, use should be avoided in patients with significant hepatic impairment due to the unpredictable conversion to terbutaline.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of >50 mL/min, no adjustment is needed. For those with GFR ≤50 mL/min, start with 5 mg OD and increase to 10 mg OD after 1-2 weeks if necessary.

**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Bambuterol is a prodrug, meaning it's converted in the body to its active form, terbutaline. Terbutaline works by selectively binding to beta-2 receptors in the lungs and uterus. This binding causes relaxation of the smooth muscles in the airways, leading to bronchodilation (widening of the airways) and relief of breathing difficulties.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Bambuterol is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to Bambuterol, terbutaline, or any component of the formulation; recent myocardial infarction; subaortic stenosis; tachycardia (with or without arrhythmia); and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

**Warnings:** Increased risk of hypokalemia exists. Use with caution in patients with hypokalemia, severe cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, closed-angle glaucoma, hepatic impairment or cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis, renal impairment, and during pregnancy (especially the first trimester and end of pregnancy).

**Drug Interactions:**  Bambuterol can interact with various medications, including beta-blockers, other long-acting beta-2 agonists, cannabinoids, CYP3A4 inhibitors, loop diuretics, MAO inhibitors, QTc-prolonging agents, sympatholytics, sympathomimetics, thiazide diuretics, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with any other medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Can I take Bambuterol with food?**  Bambuterol may be taken with or without food, but preferably shortly before bedtime.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **How should I store Bambuterol?** Store at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Can I use Bambuterol for acute asthma attacks?** No, Bambuterol is for maintenance therapy, not acute treatment.  Use a quick-relief inhaler for acute attacks.

* **What if my symptoms don't improve or worsen?** Contact your doctor immediately if your symptoms don't improve, worsen, or if you need to increase the frequency of use. This might indicate a worsening of your asthma.  Do not delay seeking medical attention.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Bambuterol?** It's advisable to avoid alcohol while taking Bambuterol.

* **Can I smoke while taking Bambuterol?**  Smoking should be avoided while taking Bambuterol.
