# Betamethasone + Neomycin
### Generic Name
Betamethasone + Neomycin

### Usage

Betamethasone and Neomycin combination is a topical corticosteroid and antibiotic cream or ointment used to treat various skin conditions characterized by inflammation and bacterial infection.  The betamethasone component reduces inflammation and itching, while neomycin combats bacterial infection.  This combination is primarily used for skin conditions like:

* **Infected eczema:**  Eczema (atopic dermatitis) often becomes infected with bacteria, leading to worsening symptoms. This combination addresses both the inflammation and the infection.
* **Infected psoriasis:** Similar to eczema, psoriasis can also be complicated by bacterial infection. This medication helps manage both the inflammation and infection associated with psoriatic plaques.
* **Infected dermatitis:**  Various forms of dermatitis (inflammation of the skin) can become infected, and this combination provides dual action.
* **Secondary bacterial skin infections:** This medication is often used to treat bacterial infections that occur secondary to other skin conditions, such as insect bites, burns (minor), or other skin trauma.


It's crucial to understand that this medication is for topical use only and should not be ingested.  It's not suitable for all skin infections, and the choice to use it should always be made in consultation with a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary depending on the specific formulation (cream, ointment), the affected area, and the severity of the condition.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Generally, a thin layer is applied to the affected area twice daily, or as directed.  

**Children:**  Use in children should be under strict medical supervision due to the potential for absorption of the corticosteroids. Dosage will be determined based on age, weight and affected area by the prescribing physician.

**Adults:** The usual adult dose is a thin film applied to the affected area twice daily.

**IV Administration:** Betamethasone and Neomycin combination is not available in an injectable (IV) form.  This combination is strictly for topical application.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Itching
* Skin dryness
* Skin irritation
* Redness

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Skin thinning (with prolonged use)
* Skin discoloration
* Stretch marks (striae)
* Increased risk of secondary infection (with prolonged use or improper hygiene)
* Suppression of the adrenal glands (with prolonged or extensive use)


If any of these side effects occur or worsen, consult a healthcare professional immediately.  Prolonged use should be avoided whenever possible, and treatment should be discontinued if no improvement is seen.

### How it Works

Betamethasone is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation by decreasing the activity of the immune system in the skin. This lessens swelling, redness, itching, and other inflammatory responses.  Neomycin is an antibiotic that inhibits the growth of susceptible bacteria, thereby helping to clear bacterial infection.  The combination tackles both the inflammatory and the infectious components of the skin condition.

### Precautions

* **Allergy:**  Do not use if you are allergic to betamethasone, neomycin, or any other component of the medication.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Consult a doctor before use.
* **Children:** Use in children should be under strict medical supervision.  Prolonged use should be avoided.
* **Wounds:** Avoid applying to open wounds or extensively broken skin.
* **Other Medications:** Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  Some interactions are possible.
* **Prolonged use:**  Prolonged use can lead to skin thinning, increased risk of infection, and other side effects.  Do not use for longer than prescribed.
* **Eyes:** Avoid contact with eyes. If accidental contact occurs, flush with plenty of water.
* **Large areas of the body:**  Do not use on large areas of the body without medical supervision, as this increases the risk of systemic absorption.
