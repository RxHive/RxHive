# Bacampicillin
### Generic Name
Bacampicillin

### Usage
Bacampicillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections.  Its primary use is combating infections affecting different parts of the body, including:

* **Skin and skin-structure infections:**  Such as cellulitis, abscesses, and impetigo.
* **Respiratory tract infections:**  This includes upper respiratory infections (like tonsillitis and pharyngitis) and lower respiratory infections (like bronchitis and pneumonia â€“ though its use in pneumonia is often limited to specific types).
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** Including cystitis and pyelonephritis (kidney infection).
* **Other infections:** Bacampicillin can also be used to treat typhoid and paratyphoid fever, biliary tract infections, and in some cases, more serious infections like endocarditis (heart valve infection), meningitis (brain infection), peritonitis (abdominal infection), and septicemia (blood infection).

While bacampicillin *can* be used against *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (the bacteria causing gonorrhea), it's generally not the preferred first-line treatment due to growing antibiotic resistance.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Most Bacterial Infections:** The typical oral dose is 400-800 mg, given two to three times daily.  The exact dose and frequency will depend on the severity of the infection and the patient's response to treatment.

* **Gonorrhea:** A single 1.6 g oral dose is sometimes used, often in combination with 1 g of probenecid.  However,  it's crucial to remember that bacampicillin is not a recommended first-line treatment for gonorrhea due to widespread resistance.

**Children and Adolescents:**

* **Most Bacterial Infections:**  The usual oral dose is 25-50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, divided into two to three doses. The maximum daily dose is 1200 mg.  Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on the child's weight and the specific infection.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (reduced creatinine clearance, CrCl).  The dosage interval should be extended (e.g., every 6-12 hours or every 12-24 hours) based on the CrCl level. This adjustment is crucial to prevent medication buildup. A doctor should determine the correct regimen.

* **Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for liver impairment. Bacampicillin should be used cautiously in such cases under close medical supervision.



### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash
* Headache
* Dizziness

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Pseudomembranous colitis (a severe bowel infection)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (a life-threatening skin condition)
* Blood disorders (e.g., anemia, leukopenia)
* Liver damage
* Kidney damage

If you experience any concerning side effects,  immediately contact a doctor or other healthcare professional.


### How it Works

Bacampicillin is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, ampicillin, in the body. Ampicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that works by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a vital component of bacterial cell walls.  By disrupting this process, ampicillin prevents bacteria from building and maintaining their cell walls, ultimately leading to their death.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Bacampicillin is contraindicated for individuals with known allergies to penicillins or cephalosporins (a related class of antibiotics).  A history of severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to any penicillin necessitates avoiding bacampicillin.

* **Interactions:** Bacampicillin can interact with several other drugs, including allopurinol, methotrexate, probenecid, and oral contraceptives.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions before taking bacampicillin if you are currently taking other medications.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Bacampicillin falls under pregnancy category B, indicating that studies in animals have not shown harm, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  Use during pregnancy should be based on a careful risk-benefit assessment by a healthcare professional. Bacampicillin is excreted in breast milk, and breastfeeding is generally not recommended while using this medication.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Individuals with impaired kidney or liver function require careful monitoring and possible dosage adjustments.

* **Other Precautions:** Avoid taking bacampicillin immediately before bed to minimize the risk of esophageal problems. Inform your doctor about any history of gastrointestinal issues or allergies before starting treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Bacampicillin with food?**  A:  Yes, you can. Taking it with food may help reduce stomach upset.

* **Q: How should I store Bacampicillin?**  A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Follow the specific storage instructions on the packaging.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The time it takes to notice improvement depends on the infection's severity and your body's response.  You'll usually see improvement within a few days, but it's essential to complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed, even if you feel better.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking Bacampicillin?**  A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication. Alcohol can potentially exacerbate some side effects.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have any concerns.
