# Benzylperoxide
### Generic Name
Benzoyl Peroxide

### Usage
Benzoyl peroxide is primarily used topically to treat mild to moderate acne vulgaris.  It works by killing the bacteria *Propionibacterium acnes* that contribute to acne breakouts.  While its main use is for acne, it's not typically used for severe or cystic acne.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in the formulation (available as a cleansing liquid or bar, lotion, cream, and gel) and the severity of the acne.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or on the product label.

**Adults and Adolescents:**  Generally, a small amount of benzoyl peroxide is applied to the affected areas once to three times daily after thoroughly washing the skin. The specific amount and frequency will be determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and response to treatment.

**Children:**  Use in children should be under strict medical supervision.  The dosage and frequency will be determined by the prescribing physician.  

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to start with a lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide and gradually increase it as tolerated to minimize skin irritation.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Skin dryness
* Irritation
* Redness
* Itching
* Burning sensation
* Peeling or flaking skin
* Swelling

Less common, but more serious side effects may include allergic reactions such as rash, hives, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any of these serious side effects.

### How it Works
Benzoyl peroxide works through a two-pronged mechanism:

1. **Antibacterial Action:** It releases free radicals that kill *P. acnes*, the bacteria responsible for much of the inflammation associated with acne.

2. **Keratolytic Effect:** It helps to loosen and shed dead skin cells, preventing pores from becoming clogged and reducing the formation of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads).

### Precautions
* **Allergy:** Avoid using benzoyl peroxide if you have a known allergy to it.
* **Sun Sensitivity:** Benzoyl peroxide can increase your skin's sensitivity to sunlight.  Use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, and limit sun exposure while using this medication.
* **Other Medications:**  Concurrent use with certain other acne medications (such as tretinoin, isotretinoin, and tazarotene) can increase irritation and reduce effectiveness. Consult your doctor before using benzoyl peroxide with other acne treatments.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Benzoyl peroxide is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are not fully understood.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using benzoyl peroxide if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Children:** Use in children should be under strict medical supervision.
* **Avoid Contact with Eyes, Mouth, or Open Wounds:** If accidental contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.
