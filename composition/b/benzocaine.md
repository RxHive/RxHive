# Benzocaine
### Generic Name
Benzocaine

### Usage

Benzocaine is a topical anesthetic used to temporarily relieve pain and itching from various minor skin irritations.  Its primary use is for the temporary relief of pain and itching associated with minor skin irritations such as cuts, scrapes, minor burns, sunburn, poison ivy, oak, or sumac, and insect bites.  It's also used for temporary relief of hemorrhoid symptoms and the pain associated with fever blisters and cold sores.  Additionally, benzocaine finds use as a topical anesthetic for oral or mucosal application, temporarily suppressing the gag reflex and relieving minor irritation and pain in the mouth and throat.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the product formulation (spray, ointment, gel, lozenge) and the area being treated.  Always follow the instructions on the product label.  Here's a general guideline:

**Adults:**

* **Dermal irritation (cuts, scrapes, burns, sunburn, insect bites):**  Ointments (5%) or sprays (5% or 20%): Apply or spray to the affected area up to four times daily as needed.  For bee stings, remove the stinger before application.
* **Poison ivy/oak/sumac:** Sprays (5%): Spray until the affected area is wet.
* **Hemorrhoids:** Ointments (20%): Apply to the affected area up to six times daily.
* **Mouth/gum irritation:** Gels/liquids (10% or 20%), ointments (20%), sprays (5%): Apply or spray to the affected area up to four times daily as needed.
* **Sore throat/mouth, gag reflex suppression:** Lozenges (10mg or 15mg): Allow one lozenge to dissolve slowly in the mouth, repeating every two hours as needed. Sprays (20%): Spray on the affected area 2-3 times or as needed, up to four times daily.
* **Topical anesthesia:** Gels or liquids (20%): Apply a small amount to the mucosa.

**Children:**

The use of benzocaine in children under 2 years old is generally not recommended due to the risk of methemoglobinemia (a serious blood disorder).  Always consult a pediatrician before using benzocaine on children.  For children aged 2 and older, dosages are generally lower and frequency less than for adults. Always refer to the specific product instructions for children's dosages.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and localized, including:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site.
* Mild redness or rash.
* Itching.
* Swelling.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (such as hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).
* Methemoglobinemia (a serious blood disorder that reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen).  Symptoms can include bluish discoloration of the skin, fatigue, headache, shortness of breath, and rapid heart rate.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, stop using benzocaine and consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Benzocaine is a local anesthetic that works by blocking nerve signals. It temporarily numbs the affected area by interfering with the transmission of pain and itching signals from the nerves to the brain.  This mechanism involves the blocking of sodium channels in nerve cell membranes, preventing the transmission of nerve impulses and thus reducing pain and itching sensations.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Do not use benzocaine if you are allergic to it, other "caine" anesthetics (like procaine or lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), or any other ingredient in the product. Do not apply to deep wounds, infections, serious burns, or lacerations.
* **Methemoglobinemia Risk:** Benzocaine carries a risk of causing methemoglobinemia, particularly in infants, young children, and individuals with certain enzyme deficiencies.  Use with extreme caution in these groups and strictly follow the dosage instructions.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Benzocaine may interact with other medications. Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of benzocaine during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a doctor, as its safety in these situations is not fully established.
* **Other Precautions:**  Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.  Some formulations may stain clothing. For oral use, avoid eating or drinking for an hour after application.
