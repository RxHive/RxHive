# Benzocaine

**Generic Name:** Benzocaine

**Usage:** Benzocaine is a local anesthetic used to numb the skin or mucous membranes.  It's commonly found in over-the-counter products for temporary relief of pain and itching associated with:

* Minor burns
* Sunburns
* Cuts
* Scrapes
* Insect bites
* Minor skin irritations
* Sore throats (in lozenges or sprays)
* Mouth ulcers (in topical gels or sprays)
* Hemorrhoids (in suppositories or creams)


**Side Effects:**  Benzocaine is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur, especially with prolonged use or large doses. These can include:

* **Mild side effects:**  Burning, stinging, or redness at the application site.
* **Allergic reactions:** These can range from mild skin rashes to more serious reactions like swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema), difficulty breathing, and a rapid heart rate.  **Methemoglobinemia**, a serious blood disorder, is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect, particularly in infants and those with certain genetic conditions.  Symptoms include bluish discoloration of the skin (cyanosis), shortness of breath, headache, and fatigue.
* **Other rare side effects:**  Headache, dizziness, drowsiness


**How it Works:** Benzocaine works by temporarily blocking the transmission of nerve impulses in the affected area.  This prevents pain signals from reaching the brain, resulting in a numbing or analgesic effect.  It's a local anesthetic that affects only the area where it's applied, not the entire body.


**FAQs:**

* **Is benzocaine safe for children?**  While benzocaine is available in some products for children, it should only be used as directed by a doctor or pharmacist.  Methemoglobinemia is a greater concern in infants.
* **Can I use benzocaine with other medications?**  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, before using benzocaine to avoid potential interactions.
* **How long does benzocaine last?** The duration of effect varies depending on the product and the area of application, but it typically lasts for 15-30 minutes.
* **What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?**  Stop using benzocaine immediately and seek medical attention.  Allergic reactions can be serious.
* **Can I use benzocaine on open wounds?**  It is generally not recommended to use benzocaine on deep wounds, or wounds with signs of infection, as this may interfere with healing.  Consult a doctor for deep or infected wounds.
* **What is methemoglobinemia?** Methemoglobinemia is a rare but serious condition where the blood's ability to carry oxygen is reduced. It's characterized by a bluish discoloration of the skin. If you experience this, seek immediate medical attention.
