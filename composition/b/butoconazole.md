# Butoconazole
### Generic Name
Butoconazole

### Usage
Butoconazole is an antifungal medication used topically to treat vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), commonly known as a yeast infection, caused by *Candida albicans*.  While primarily used for this condition,  it's crucial to understand that butoconazole is a topical treatment and is not effective against systemic fungal infections.  It's important to have a proper diagnosis from a healthcare professional to ensure butoconazole is the appropriate treatment.


### Dosage
**Adults (Vulvovaginal Candidiasis):**  The typical adult dose is a single application of one applicatorful (approximately 5 grams) of 2% butoconazole cream intravaginally.  For complicated infections (recurrent, severe, caused by non-*albicans Candida*, or in immunocompromised individuals), a longer treatment course might be necessary, as determined by a healthcare provider.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of butoconazole in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children unless specifically directed by a pediatrician.


**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, it's always best to discuss any pre-existing conditions with a doctor before starting any new medication.

### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

*   Abdominal cramps
*   Abdominal pain
*   Pelvic pain
*   Vulvovaginal burning
*   Vulvovaginal soreness
*   Vulvovaginal itching (pruritus)
*   Local swelling

Serious side effects are rare but can occur.  If you experience any unusual or severe side effects, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Butoconazole is an azole antifungal. It works by interfering with the production of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. By disrupting ergosterol synthesis, butoconazole alters the cell membrane's permeability, leading to fungal cell death or inhibited growth.  This effectively combats the *Candida* infection.

### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:** Butoconazole is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to butoconazole or any components of the formulation.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Butoconazole may interact with progesterone, potentially reducing its effectiveness. Concomitant use should be avoided or discussed with a doctor.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Butoconazole is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  While single-dose topical azoles are generally not recommended during pregnancy, longer-course topical azole treatments might be considered in certain circumstances. Consult a healthcare professional to weigh the risks and benefits. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution during breastfeeding and always discuss medication use with your doctor or lactation consultant.
*   **General Precautions:**  Insert the cream deep into the vagina using the provided applicator. Do not use a damaged applicator. The cream contains mineral oil, which may weaken latex condoms or diaphragms. Avoid using these products within 72 hours of treatment.  Recurrent or difficult-to-treat yeast infections might indicate an underlying condition like HIV, which should be investigated.

### FAQs

A: No. Butoconazole is specifically for topical treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. It is not effective against other fungal infections or systemic infections.  See a doctor for diagnosis and appropriate treatment of other fungal infections.
