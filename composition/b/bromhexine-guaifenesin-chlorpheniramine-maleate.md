# Bromhexine + Guaifenesin + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Bromhexine + Guaifenesin + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, the flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  Specifically, it addresses:

* **Cough:** Bromhexine helps to loosen mucus (expectorant) making it easier to cough up. Guaifenesin also acts as an expectorant, thinning and loosening phlegm.
* **Runny Nose/Sneezing:** Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that helps to dry up runny noses and reduce sneezing.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, constipation, headache.
* **Less Common:**  Blurred vision, upset stomach, vomiting, nervousness, insomnia, urinary retention.
* **Rare but Serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of possible side effects.  The likelihood and severity of side effects depend on the dosage and individual sensitivity.

**How it Works:**

* **Bromhexine:**  Reduces the stickiness of mucus in the airways, making it easier to expel. It does this by altering the mucus glycoprotein composition.
* **Guaifenesin:**  Thins and loosens mucus, facilitating its removal through coughing.  It increases the fluid content of the mucus.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This helps reduce symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
