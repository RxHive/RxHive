# Bromocriptine

**Generic Name:** Bromocriptine mesylate

**Usage:**

Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist, meaning it mimics the effects of dopamine in the brain.  Its primary uses include:

* **Treatment of hyperprolactinemia:** This is an excess of prolactin, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland.  Hyperprolactinemia can cause menstrual irregularities, infertility, galactorrhea (milk production in non-breastfeeding individuals), and decreased libido in women, and decreased libido and impotence in men.
* **Treatment of Parkinson's disease:** Bromocriptine can be used to reduce symptoms of Parkinson's disease, although it's generally not a first-line treatment. It's often used in combination with other medications or when other medications become less effective.
* **Treatment of prolactinomas:** These are tumors of the pituitary gland that produce excess prolactin.
* **Suppression of lactation (postpartum):** Although less common now, it can help suppress milk production after childbirth.
* **Acromegaly (off-label):** In some cases, it may be used to treat acromegaly, a condition caused by excess growth hormone.


**Side Effects:**

Bromocriptine can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and some rare.  The most common include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal cramps
* **Neurological:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, fatigue, lightheadedness
* **Cardiovascular:** Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up), palpitations
* **Psychiatric:** Hallucinations, confusion, depression, anxiety
* **Other:** Nasal congestion, dry mouth, leg cramps


More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* **Pulmonary hypertension:**  A serious condition affecting the blood vessels in the lungs.
* **Fibrosis:** Scarring of tissue in various organs.
* **Psychiatric disorders:** Worsening of pre-existing psychiatric conditions.


**How it Works:**

Bromocriptine works by stimulating dopamine receptors in the brain.  In the case of hyperprolactinemia, it inhibits the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland.  In Parkinson's disease, it helps to replace the dopamine that is deficient in the brain.


**FAQs:**

* **Is bromocriptine addictive?**  While not physically addictive in the same way as opioids, tolerance can develop, meaning higher doses may be needed over time to achieve the same effect.  Withdrawal symptoms can occur if the medication is stopped abruptly.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking bromocriptine?**  Alcohol can exacerbate the side effects of bromocriptine, particularly drowsiness and dizziness.  It's best to avoid alcohol or limit consumption while taking this medication.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.

* **Can bromocriptine be taken during pregnancy?**  Bromocriptine is generally avoided during pregnancy due to potential risks to the developing fetus.

* **How long does it take to work?** The time it takes for bromocriptine to show effects varies depending on the condition being treated and individual response.
