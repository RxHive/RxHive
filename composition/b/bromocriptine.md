# Bromocriptine
### Generic Name
Bromocriptine

### Usage

Bromocriptine is a medication primarily used to treat conditions related to excess prolactin production (hyperprolactinemia).  This includes prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas (tumors), which can cause symptoms like amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), galactorrhea (inappropriate milk production), hypogonadism (reduced sex hormone function), and infertility.  It's also used to treat acromegaly (a condition characterized by excessive growth hormone production), and as an adjunctive therapy (used in addition to other treatments) for Parkinson's disease. In specific formulations (like the quick-release tablet), it can be used as an adjunct to diet and exercise for improving glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's important to note that it's not used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.  Bromocriptine may also be used off-label in managing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction to antipsychotic medications.


### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the condition being treated and the individual patient.  Precise dosages should always be determined by a healthcare professional.  The following provides a general overview, and should *not* be considered a substitute for medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Acromegaly:**  Usually starts at 1.25-2.5 mg daily, gradually increased until an effective dose (often 20-30 mg daily) is reached. The maximum daily dose is 100 mg.

* **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Quick-Release Tablet Only):** Typically begins at 0.8 mg once daily, increasing in 0.8 mg increments weekly as tolerated.  The usual dose is 1.6-4.8 mg once daily, with a maximum of 4.8 mg daily.  Note that dosage may need adjustment with concurrent use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin).

* **Hyperprolactinemia:** Starts at 1.25-2.5 mg daily, increased by 2.5 mg every 2-7 days as tolerated, with a typical range of 2.5-15 mg daily.

* **Parkinsonism:**  Begins at 1.25 mg twice daily, with increases of 2.5 mg daily every 2-4 weeks as needed. The maximum daily dose is 100 mg.

* **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) (Off-Label):** Typically starts at 2.5 mg every 8-12 hours, orally or via gastric tube, with potential increases up to a maximum of 45 mg daily, depending on response.

**Children:** Dosage for children, particularly for hyperprolactinemia, is significantly lower and must be carefully determined by a pediatrician or endocrinologist, considering factors like age and weight.  Specific pediatric dosage guidelines should be consulted.

**Administration:**  Bromocriptine is usually administered orally, in tablet form.  For type 2 diabetes, the quick-release formulation is specifically recommended for timed morning administration.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Drowsiness
* Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing)
* Asthenia (weakness or fatigue)


Less common, but more serious side effects can involve cardiovascular problems (such as irregular heartbeat, high or low blood pressure, heart attack, stroke), gastrointestinal bleeding, visual or auditory hallucinations, and neurological issues.  Any unusual or concerning side effects require immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist, meaning it mimics the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter.  In conditions like hyperprolactinemia, it works by stimulating dopamine receptors in the pituitary gland, suppressing prolactin release. In Parkinson's disease, it helps improve motor function by affecting dopamine pathways in the brain.  For type 2 diabetes, its mechanism isn't fully understood but involves improving insulin sensitivity and glucose control.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Bromocriptine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or ergot alkaloids, uncontrolled hypertension, during breastfeeding, postpartum period in women with coronary artery disease or severe cardiovascular conditions, and in certain diabetes-related situations (type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis; for quick-release tablets).  Pregnancy is also a contraindication.
* **Interactions:**  Bromocriptine's effects can be altered by other medications.  Significant interactions may occur with erythromycin (increased Bromocriptine levels), alcohol (reduced tolerance to both substances), and antihypertensive drugs (potentiated effects).  Psychotropics should generally be avoided.
* **Warnings:**  Bromocriptine may cause cardiovascular side effects (hypotension, hypertension), CNS depression, hallucinations, impulse control disorders, and potentially, melanoma or fibrosis.  Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, hepatic impairment, peptic ulcers, and psychosis.  Gradual dosage reduction is recommended upon discontinuation, particularly after long-term use, to reduce the risk of withdrawal syndromes.

### FAQs

* **Can I take Bromocriptine with food?** Yes, taking it with food can help minimize gastrointestinal upset.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** For the quick-release tablet (Type 2 diabetes) wait until the next morning.  For other formulations, consult your healthcare provider.
* **How should I store Bromocriptine?** Store as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture.
* **Is Bromocriptine safe during pregnancy?** No, it is contraindicated during pregnancy.
* **Can I breastfeed while taking Bromocriptine?** No, it is contraindicated during breastfeeding.
* **What if I experience severe side effects?** Seek immediate medical attention.
