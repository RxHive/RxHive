# Budesonide + Glycopyrrolate + Formoterol fumarate
### Generic Name
Budesonide + Glycopyrrolate + Formoterol fumarate

### Usage
This triple combination medication is specifically indicated for the **maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** in adults.  It's crucial to understand that this combination is **not approved for the treatment of asthma**.  The medication works by combining the effects of three different active ingredients to improve lung function and reduce symptoms associated with COPD.


### Dosage
**Adults (COPD):** The recommended dose is Budesonide 320 mcg, Glycopyrrolate 18 mcg, and Formoterol fumarate 9.6 mcg, administered via oral inhalation. This is delivered as two inhalations (160 mcg Budesonide, 9 mcg Glycopyrrolate, and 4.8 mcg Formoterol fumarate per inhalation) twice daily (BID), once in the morning and once in the evening.  Do not exceed two inhalations per dose.

**Children:** This medication is not approved for use in children.  Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Patients with severe hepatic impairment may experience increased systemic exposure to Budesonide and Formoterol fumarate, requiring careful monitoring for signs of increased drug effects. In patients with severe renal impairment, use should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occur in >5% of patients):**

* Upper respiratory tract infection

**Less Common Side Effects (occur in <5% of patients):**

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
This medication combines three different mechanisms to manage COPD symptoms:

* **Budesonide (Inhaled Corticosteroid):**  Reduces inflammation in the airways.  It works by suppressing the activity of various inflammatory cells and mediators that contribute to airway narrowing and mucus production.

* **Glycopyrrolate (Anticholinergic):** Relaxes the muscles in the airways, leading to bronchodilation (widening of the airways). It achieves this by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that causes airway constriction.

* **Formoterol fumarate (Long-Acting Beta-2-Agonist):** Also relaxes airway muscles, causing bronchodilation. It works by stimulating beta-2 receptors in the lungs, leading to increased cyclic AMP levels and ultimately muscle relaxation.


The combined action of these three components helps to improve airflow, reduce shortness of breath, and decrease the frequency of exacerbations in COPD patients.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Budesonide, Glycopyrrolate, Formoterol fumarate, or any of the excipients.

**Warnings:**  This combination carries a risk of serious asthma-related events, oropharyngeal candidiasis, pneumonia, infections, hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, paradoxical bronchospasm, cardiovascular effects (increased blood pressure, pulse rate, cardiac arrhythmias), decreased bone mineral density, glaucoma, cataracts, worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma, worsening of urinary retention, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia.

**Use with Caution:** Use cautiously in patients with existing tuberculosis, ocular herpes simplex, fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; cardiovascular disorders; narrow-angle glaucoma; prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction; convulsive disorders; thyrotoxicosis; diabetes mellitus; ketoacidosis; or when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole), MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or other drugs that prolong the QTc interval.  Consider potential interactions with other medications, particularly beta-blockers, other adrenergic drugs, diuretics, xanthine derivatives, and other anticholinergics.
