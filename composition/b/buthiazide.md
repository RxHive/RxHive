# Buthiazide
### Generic Name
Buthiazide

### Usage

Buthiazide is a thiazide diuretic primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and edema (fluid retention).  Its diuretic action helps to lower blood pressure by increasing the excretion of sodium and water from the body.  Additionally, it has secondary uses in managing diabetes insipidus (a condition causing excessive thirst and urination), congestive heart failure (a condition where the heart can't pump enough blood), and as a preventative measure against calcium-containing kidney stones.


### Dosage

Dosage for buthiazide varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual's response.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's specific instructions.  Generally:

* **Adults:** For hypertension and edema, the initial dose is typically 5-15 mg per day, either once daily or twice daily. The maintenance dose may be adjusted to 10-15 mg every third day, depending on the patient's response and blood pressure readings. For diabetes insipidus, congestive heart failure, and kidney stone prevention, the starting dose is also usually 5-15 mg daily, possibly divided into two doses.

* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of buthiazide in children haven't been established, so it's not generally prescribed for pediatric use.

* **Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for patients with liver or kidney impairment in the manufacturer's labeling. However, caution is advised in such cases.  A healthcare professional will carefully monitor patients with compromised liver or kidney function and adjust the dose as needed.  The medication should be used cautiously in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function.

The medication is usually administered orally in tablet form.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Concentration difficulties
* Palpitations
* Perspiration
* Low blood pressure (especially at the start of treatment)
* Skin rash (urticaria)
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Changes in blood sugar levels
* Low potassium levels (hypokalemia)
* Low sodium levels (hyponatremia)
* Low magnesium levels (hypomagnesemia)
* Low chloride levels (hypochloremia)
* High calcium levels (hypercalcemia)
* Impotence
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal cramping
* Constipation or diarrhea
* Dry mouth
* Blood clots (thrombosis and emboli)
* Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity reactions)
* Worsening of existing nearsightedness (myopia)


Less common but serious side effects are possible.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Buthiazide is a thiazide diuretic. It works in the kidneys by blocking the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions from the tubules (small tubes in the kidneys). This increases the excretion of these ions, along with water, in the urine.  By reducing the amount of sodium and water in the body, buthiazide helps lower blood pressure and reduce edema.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Buthiazide should not be used by individuals with an allergy to buthiazide, any component of the medication, or sulfonamide-derived drugs.  It's also contraindicated in patients with anuria (absence of urine production).

* **Interactions:** Buthiazide can interact with numerous other medications, potentially leading to adverse effects.  Some important interactions involve medications like digoxin (increased risk of toxicity), ACE inhibitors (enhanced blood pressure lowering), and certain other drugs that can affect potassium levels.  It is crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.  Vitamin D coadministration with thiazide diuretics requires careful monitoring due to potential vitamin D deficiency.

* **Warnings:**  Buthiazide should be used cautiously in patients with electrolyte imbalances (like low potassium or sodium), diabetes, high uric acid levels (hyperuricemia), liver or kidney disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus.  Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and blood sugar is necessary in these situations.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare providers before taking this medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Buthiazide with other medications?**  A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you're taking to avoid dangerous interactions.

* **Q: How should I store Buthiazide?** A: Store it as directed on the label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking Buthiazide suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping Buthiazide can lead to rebound hypertension.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding tapering off the medication.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Buthiazide?** A: Long-term use can be associated with various side effects, including electrolyte imbalances and metabolic changes. Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential.  Any concerns regarding long-term use should be addressed with a doctor.
