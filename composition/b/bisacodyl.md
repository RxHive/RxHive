# Bisacodyl

**Generic Name:** Bisacodyl

**Usage:** Bisacodyl is a stimulant laxative used to treat constipation.  It's also sometimes used to cleanse the bowel before a medical procedure such as a colonoscopy.  It is available over-the-counter (OTC) and by prescription.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects of bisacodyl include:

* Abdominal cramps
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Rectal burning or irritation
* Dehydration (due to fluid loss from diarrhea)
* Dizziness

More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* Severe abdominal pain
* Rectal bleeding
* Electrolyte imbalance (especially potassium)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)


**How it Works:** Bisacodyl stimulates the muscles in the intestines, increasing the movement of the bowels and promoting bowel evacuation.  It works directly on the intestinal lining, increasing both the amount of water and electrolytes secreted into the intestine and the contractions of the intestinal muscles.

**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?** Bisacodyl tablets usually take 6-12 hours to produce a bowel movement. Suppositories typically work more quickly, within 15-60 minutes.
* **Can I take bisacodyl every day?** No, bisacodyl is not intended for daily use.  Long-term use can lead to dependence, electrolyte imbalances, and dehydration.  It should only be used occasionally to relieve constipation.  If you have chronic constipation, consult your doctor.
* **What are the interactions with other medications?** Bisacodyl can interact with certain medications, particularly those that affect electrolyte balance (like diuretics or heart medications).  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Is bisacodyl safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered after consultation with a healthcare professional, as its safety hasn't been fully established.
* **What should I do if I experience severe side effects?**  If you experience severe abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or other serious side effects, stop taking bisacodyl and seek medical attention immediately.
* **Can I take bisacodyl with other laxatives?** Generally, it's best to avoid combining bisacodyl with other laxatives without consulting your doctor or pharmacist.
* **How should I store bisacodyl?** Store bisacodyl at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep it out of reach of children.
