# Binimetinib
### Generic Name
Binimetinib

### Usage

Binimetinib is a medication primarily used to treat unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  This means it's used for melanoma that cannot be surgically removed or has spread to other parts of the body.  Crucially, its use is limited to patients whose melanoma has a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, as confirmed by an FDA-approved test.  It is always used in combination with another medication, encorafenib.  While not officially approved for these uses, Binimetinib is sometimes used off-label in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab for metastatic or refractory colorectal cancer, specifically those with a RAS wild-type or BRAF V600E mutation.  However, it's important to note that off-label uses are not as rigorously studied and carry additional considerations.  Always consult a healthcare provider for guidance on treatment options.

### Dosage

Dosage information for Binimetinib should always come directly from your prescribing healthcare professional.  The following information is for general knowledge and should not substitute professional medical advice.

**Adult Dosage:**  For unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, the typical dosage is 45 mg twice daily (BID), approximately 12 hours apart, in combination with encorafenib, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. For off-label use in colorectal cancer (as mentioned above), the dosage is also typically 45 mg BID, but given in combination with both encorafenib and cetuximab.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Binimetinib have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary based on factors such as liver and kidney function, as well as the occurrence of side effects.  Severe liver impairment may require a dose reduction to 30 mg BID.  Renal impairment usually does not necessitate dose changes, and Binimetinib is not removed through hemodialysis.  Dose reductions or interruptions may be necessary if side effects such as elevated liver enzymes, cardiac issues, skin reactions, or eye problems occur. These adjustments should be guided by a healthcare provider, who will monitor you closely.

### Side Effects

**Important Note:** This list isn't exhaustive.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor or other healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Binimetinib is a type of medication called a kinase inhibitor.  Specifically, it targets MEK (mitogen-activated extracellular signal-related kinase) 1 and 2 enzymes.  These enzymes are part of a signaling pathway (the MAPK/ERK pathway) that's often overactive in cancers with BRAF mutations. By inhibiting MEK, Binimetinib helps to slow or stop the growth and spread of cancer cells.  It's most effective when used in combination with a BRAF inhibitor (encorafenib), leading to a synergistic effect.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** There are no specific contraindications listed by the manufacturer.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Binimetinib may interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Binimetinib can harm a developing fetus. Women of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days after the final dose. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment or for three days after the final dose.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment. Renal (kidney) impairment usually doesn't require dose changes.
* **Cardiac Risk:** Binimetinib may affect the heart, so regular monitoring of heart function is necessary.  Individuals with pre-existing heart conditions should be closely monitored.
* **Other Warnings:**  Be aware of the potential for eye problems, skin reactions, and other side effects.  Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor immediately.
