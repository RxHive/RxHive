# Beclometasone + Fusidic Acid
### Generic Name
Beclometasone + Fusidic Acid

### Usage
Beclometasone dipropionate and fusidic acid is a combination medication used to treat skin conditions involving inflammation and bacterial infection.  It's primarily prescribed for eczema (dermatitis) that has become infected with bacteria, often manifesting as weeping, crusting, or intensely itchy sores.  The beclometasone component is a corticosteroid, which reduces inflammation and itching.  The fusidic acid component is an antibiotic that targets and kills bacteria commonly responsible for skin infections in eczema.  While primarily used for eczema, it may also be used to treat other bacterial skin infections accompanied by inflammation, but this should always be under the guidance of a doctor.  This is not a first-line treatment for uncomplicated bacterial skin infections; it's specifically indicated when inflammation is a significant factor.

### Dosage
Dosage depends on the specific formulation (cream, ointment), the affected area's size, and the severity of the condition.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage and application frequency.  Generally, a thin layer is applied to the affected area twice daily, or as directed by the physician.  It's crucial to avoid applying it to large areas of skin or for prolonged periods without medical supervision, due to the potential side effects of the corticosteroid.  There is no standard pediatric dosage differing greatly from adult dosage; application is tailored to the size of the affected area rather than the patient's age.  This medication is for external use only and should not be ingested or applied to broken skin or open wounds.  Intravenous or oral administration is not applicable for this combination.

### Side Effects
* **Common Side Effects:** Skin thinning, itching, burning, stinging at the application site, skin dryness, skin discoloration (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation), acneiform eruptions.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but warrant immediate medical attention.  They include allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), fungal or viral skin infections (secondary infections), worsening of the underlying skin condition, and systemic effects from prolonged or excessive use (such as elevated blood sugar levels).


### How it Works
Beclometasone dipropionate, a corticosteroid, works by reducing inflammation in the skin.  It does this by suppressing the immune response that causes swelling, redness, and itching.  Fusidic acid, an antibiotic, works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, thus preventing the bacteria from multiplying and spreading the infection.  The combination of these two active ingredients tackles both the inflammatory and infectious aspects of the skin condition.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used if you have a known allergy to either beclometasone dipropionate or fusidic acid.  It should also be used with caution in patients with skin conditions such as rosacea or perioral dermatitis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Although relatively few direct drug interactions are documented, inform your doctor about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies.
* **Warnings:**  Avoid applying to the face for extended periods.  Avoid getting the medication in the eyes.  Do not use it for longer than recommended by your doctor.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using this medication.  Children should be under close supervision when applying this cream or ointment.  Long-term or widespread application can lead to systemic absorption of the corticosteroid, resulting in potential side effects.
