# Beclometasone + Fusidic Acid

**Generic Name:** Beclometasone dipropionate + Fusidic acid

**Usage:** This combination is a topical treatment for skin conditions involving both inflammation and bacterial infection.  It's commonly used for eczema that has become secondarily infected with bacteria, or other inflammatory skin conditions with bacterial involvement.  The specific conditions will vary by country and prescribing physician but may include:

* Eczema (atopic dermatitis) with a secondary bacterial infection
* Psoriasis with a secondary bacterial infection
* Impetigo
* Other inflammatory skin conditions with bacterial infection

**Important Note:** This is a potent combination and should *only* be used as directed by a doctor. It is not suitable for all skin conditions and inappropriate use can lead to adverse effects and complications.  Self-treating can be harmful.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **At the application site:** Burning, itching, stinging, redness, dryness, thinning of the skin, skin irritation, folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles), acne-like eruptions, skin atrophy (thinning and weakening of the skin).  Prolonged use can lead to skin changes like striae (stretch marks) and hypopigmentation (loss of skin color).
* **Systemic side effects (less common but possible with prolonged use or large areas of application):** These are less frequent but can include suppression of the adrenal glands (especially in children), increased blood glucose levels, cataracts, glaucoma (although these are rare).

**How it Works:**

* **Beclometasone dipropionate:** This is a corticosteroid. It works by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune response in the skin, thereby relieving itching, redness, and swelling.
* **Fusidic acid:** This is an antibiotic. It works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria that are causing the secondary infection.  The combination addresses both the inflammatory component and the bacterial infection simultaneously.
