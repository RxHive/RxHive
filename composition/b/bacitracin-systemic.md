# Bacitracin (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Bacitracin (Systemic)

### Usage
Bacitracin (systemic) is a polypeptide antibiotic primarily used to treat pneumonia and empyema (pus accumulation in the pleural space) in infants caused by susceptible staphylococci bacteria.  Its use is very limited due to significant risks.  Off-label uses, such as treating *Clostridioides difficile*-associated diarrhea and eradicating vancomycin-resistant *Enterococcus faecium*, exist but are not standard practice and should only be considered under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Bacitracin systemic administration carries a significant risk of nephrotoxicity (kidney damage).  Dosage should be determined and closely monitored by a physician.

* **Infants with Staphylococcal Pneumonia and Empyema:**
    * Infants weighing ≤2.5 kg: 900 units/kg/day intramuscularly (IM) in 2-3 divided doses.
    * Infants weighing >2.5 kg: 1000 units/kg/day IM in 2-3 divided doses.
    * Children and adolescents: 800-1200 units/kg/day IM in divided doses every 8 hours.

* **Off-label uses (e.g., *C. difficile* infection):**  Dosage varies considerably and is not standardized. The physician will determine the appropriate dosage based on individual patient factors.  Oral administration is common in these instances. One example cited is 25,000 units four times a day (QID) for 7-10 days.

**Administration:**  Intramuscular (IM) injection is the standard route for systemic bacitracin.  For off-label uses, oral administration may be used.  Always follow the instructions provided by your physician or pharmacist.


### Side Effects

**Common:**

* Skin rash
* Nausea and vomiting
* Pain at the injection site

**Serious (but less common):**

* Albuminuria (albumin in the urine)
* Azotemia (increased nitrogenous waste products in the blood)
* Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage, potentially leading to renal failure)
* Casts in urine (indicative of kidney damage)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)

**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Bacitracin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis. It works by preventing the incorporation of mucopeptides into the growing bacterial cell wall, ultimately inhibiting bacterial growth and leading to bacterial cell death.  This mechanism is specific to bacteria; it does not affect human cells in the same way.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Bacitracin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to bacitracin or any component of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** Bacitracin may interact with several medications, including anesthetics, BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccine, other nephrotoxic drugs (such as aminoglycosides), neuromuscular-blocking agents, and sodium picosulfate. Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Renal Impairment:** Bacitracin is nephrotoxic and should be discontinued if any signs of renal dysfunction occur.  Careful monitoring of renal function is essential.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Bacitracin is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the risks to the fetus are not fully understood. Its use during pregnancy should be carefully evaluated by a physician. Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **General Precautions:**  Maintain adequate fluid intake to help prevent kidney damage.  The systemic use of Bacitracin should only occur in settings with appropriate laboratory monitoring and close patient supervision.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Bacitracin administered?** A: Systemically, Bacitracin is usually administered via intramuscular injection.  Off-label oral administration may be used under a doctor's direction.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the infection and dosage. Improvement may be seen within a few days, but treatment courses typically last several days to a week.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Bacitracin if I feel better?** A: No, it's crucial to complete the entire course of treatment prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better, to prevent the risk of recurrence and ensure complete eradication of the infection.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on how to proceed if you miss a dose.

* **Q: How should I store Bacitracin?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by the manufacturer on the product label.  Generally, this involves storing it at room temperature and away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Is Bacitracin safe for children?** A: Its use in children is restricted to specific indications (like staphylococcal pneumonia and empyema in infants) and requires careful monitoring due to the risk of nephrotoxicity.  Use should only be under a physician's strict supervision.
