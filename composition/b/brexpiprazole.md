# Brexpiprazole
### Generic Name
Brexpiprazole

### Usage
Brexpiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic medication primarily used in two ways:

*   **Adjunctive treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):**  It's used alongside antidepressants to improve the symptoms of MDD in adults who haven't responded adequately to antidepressants alone.  This means it works best when combined with other treatments for depression.

*   **Treatment of Schizophrenia:** Brexpiprazole is also approved for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia in adults.  Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects a person's thinking, feelings, and behavior. Brexpiprazole helps manage the positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) and negative symptoms (lack of motivation, social withdrawal) of this condition.

It's important to note that Brexpiprazole is not a first-line treatment for either MDD or schizophrenia. It's typically used when other treatments haven't been fully effective.  Off-label use, meaning use for conditions not officially approved by regulatory bodies, may include managing agitation and aggression in patients with severe dementia, though this should only be considered under strict medical supervision due to significant risks.

### Dosage

Dosage of Brexpiprazole varies depending on the condition being treated and individual patient factors.  Always follow your doctor's prescription exactly.

**Schizophrenia:**

*   **Adults:** The initial dose is typically 1 mg once daily for the first four days. The dose is then gradually increased to a target of 2–4 mg once daily, depending on individual response and tolerance.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 4 mg.

**Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):**

*   **Adults:** Treatment starts with 0.5 mg or 1 mg once daily. The dose is adjusted upward to a target of 2 mg once daily over several weeks, based on the patient's response and tolerance. The maximum recommended daily dose is 3 mg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with:

*   **Hepatic impairment (liver problems):**  Reduced maximum doses are recommended for moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
*   **Renal impairment (kidney problems):**  Reduced maximum doses are recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of less than 60 mL/min.
*   **CYP2D6 poor metabolizers:** Patients who are poor metabolizers of the CYP2D6 enzyme may require a significantly reduced dose.  This is further reduced if they are also taking strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.
*   **CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers:** Dose adjustments are also necessary for patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, affecting how the body processes the medication. Consult your doctor for the correct adjusted dose.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Brexpiprazole have not been established in children.

**Administration:** Brexpiprazole is typically administered orally in tablet form.

### Side Effects

Brexpiprazole, like other antipsychotics, can cause side effects.  The frequency and severity of these vary between individuals.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

*   Akathisia (restlessness)
*   Increased triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood)
*   Weight gain

**Less Common but Potentially Significant Side Effects (occurring in 1–10% of patients):**

*   Drowsiness, dizziness, insomnia, headache, fatigue
*   Nausea, constipation, vomiting
*   Tremor, muscle aches
*   Blurred vision
*   Increased appetite

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (occurring in less than 1% of patients):**

*   Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) - a rare but life-threatening condition.
*   Tardive dyskinesia -  involuntary movements that can be permanent.
*   Suicidal thoughts or behaviors.
*   Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing).
*   Seizures

**Post-marketing surveillance has identified additional potential side effects such as:** Impulse control disorders (e.g., pathological gambling), hyperglycemia, and diabetes mellitus.

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Brexpiprazole's exact mechanism of action in treating MDD and schizophrenia isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to work by affecting several neurotransmitters in the brain:

*   **Partial agonist at serotonin 5-HT1A receptors:** This action helps modulate serotonin levels, potentially improving mood and reducing anxiety.
*   **Partial agonist at dopamine D2 receptors:**  This balances dopamine activity.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with several mental health functions.  The partial agonism is thought to minimize the risk of certain side effects associated with full dopamine blockage.
*   **Antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors:** This action helps reduce some of the symptoms associated with schizophrenia and depression.

By influencing these neurotransmitters, Brexpiprazole helps to restore a better balance in brain chemistry, potentially alleviating symptoms of both MDD and schizophrenia.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Brexpiprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to the drug.
*   **Increased Mortality Risk:** There's an increased risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotics.  Brexpiprazole is not approved for this use.
*   **Suicidal Ideation:** Antipsychotics, including Brexpiprazole, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, particularly in young adults. Close monitoring is essential.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Brexpiprazole's metabolism can be affected by other medications, especially strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of Brexpiprazole during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration of the potential risks to the fetus or infant.
*   **Elderly Patients:** Elderly patients may be more susceptible to side effects like orthostatic hypotension.
*   **Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary.
*   **Patients with Diabetes or Cardiovascular Disease:** Brexpiprazole can affect glucose metabolism and may worsen pre-existing conditions.

### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I stop taking Brexpiprazole suddenly?** A: No, always gradually reduce the dose under your doctor's supervision to prevent withdrawal symptoms.

*   **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Brexpiprazole?** A: It's best to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking Brexpiprazole, as it can increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects.

*   **Q: How should I store Brexpiprazole?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and light.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Never double up on doses.

*   **Q:  Is Brexpiprazole habit-forming?** A: Brexpiprazole is not considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids. However, it can be psychologically habituating.  This means that stopping suddenly might produce a desire to continue use.  Always follow the medical plan for discontinuing the medication.

*   **Q: Can Brexpiprazole affect driving ability?** A: Drowsiness is a possible side effect, so you should avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you.
