# Bentoquatam
### Generic Name
Bentoquatam

### Usage
Bentoquatam is a topical skin protectant primarily used to prevent allergic contact dermatitis caused by exposure to urushiol, the oily resin found in poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac.  It acts as a barrier, preventing urushiol from contacting and penetrating the skin.  This is a preventative measure; it does not treat existing reactions.

### Dosage
**Adults and Children â‰¥ 6 years:**

* **Topical Lotion (5%):** Apply a thin layer to clean, dry skin at least 15 minutes before anticipated exposure to poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac. Reapply every 4 hours, or more frequently if needed, for continued protection.  Wash off thoroughly with soap and water after potential exposure has ended.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are rare but may include:

* Erythema (redness)

Serious side effects are uncommon.  However, allergic reactions are possible. If any adverse reactions occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider.


### How it Works
Bentoquatam is an organoclay that works by physically binding to urushiol.  By creating a protective barrier on the skin, it prevents urushiol from coming into contact with skin cells, thus preventing the allergic reaction.  It's important to note that bentoquatam does not neutralize urushiol already on the skin; it prevents further contact.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Bentoquatam is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to bentoquatam or any component of the formulation, and should not be applied to open wounds or broken skin (e.g., existing rash).
* **Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of bentoquatam during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.  Consult a healthcare professional before use.
* **General Precautions:** For external use only. Flammable; keep away from heat and open flame. Shake well before use. Avoid contact with eyes.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Bentoquatam to work?** A: Bentoquatam works immediately upon application as a barrier to urushiol.  The protection lasts until the lotion is washed off or significantly rubbed away.

* **Q: Can I use Bentoquatam if I already have a rash?** A: No. Bentoquatam is for prevention only and should not be applied to existing rashes or open wounds.  Treat any existing rash with appropriate medications as directed by a healthcare professional.

* **Q: How should I store Bentoquatam?** A: Store at room temperature, away from heat and open flame, and out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?** A: Stop using Bentoquatam immediately and contact your doctor or other healthcare provider.
