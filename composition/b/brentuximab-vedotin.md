# Brentuximab Vedotin
### Generic Name
Brentuximab Vedotin

### Usage
Brentuximab vedotin is a targeted cancer therapy used to treat several types of lymphoma and mycosis fungoides.  Its primary use is in treating various forms of lymphoma, specifically those expressing the CD30 protein on their surface. These include:

* **Systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (sALCL):**  This is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin is used both for previously untreated sALCL and for cases that have relapsed or become resistant to other treatments.
* **Primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (pcALCL):** A less common type of lymphoma affecting the skin.  It's used in cases that have relapsed after prior systemic therapy.
* **Classical Hodgkin lymphoma:**  This is another type of lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin is used in several scenarios:  patients who haven't received prior treatment, those who have relapsed or become resistant after previous chemotherapy, and as consolidation therapy after autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) to reduce the risk of relapse.
* **CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL):** This includes angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and PTCL not otherwise specified. It is used for previously untreated cases.
* **CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides:** A type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.  Treatment is for patients who have received prior systemic therapy.


### Dosage
The dosage of Brentuximab vedotin varies greatly depending on the specific type of lymphoma being treated, whether it's a first-line treatment or a later-line treatment, and the patient's overall health. It's always administered intravenously (IV).  Precise dosing and schedules are determined and closely monitored by a healthcare professional.  

Here is a summary of general dosage ranges. **This information is not a substitute for the prescribing information provided by a qualified healthcare professional.**  The specific dosage, frequency, and duration of treatment will be determined by the oncologist based on individual patient factors.

* **Dosage typically ranges from 1.2 mg/kg to 1.8 mg/kg of body weight.**
* **Administration frequency:**  This can be every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks, depending on the specific treatment regimen.
* **Total number of doses:** The total number of treatments depends on the patient's response to the medication and the presence of side effects. It can range from 6-8 doses to 16 cycles.
* **Combination therapy:** In some cases, Brentuximab vedotin is used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs.
* **Maximum dose:**  The maximum single dose is usually between 90 mg and 180 mg, dependent on the regimen.
* **Pediatric use:** The safety and effectiveness of Brentuximab vedotin have not been established in children.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Neuropathy (nerve damage), particularly peripheral sensory neuropathy (numbness, tingling, pain in the extremities) and peripheral motor neuropathy (muscle weakness).
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Decreased appetite
* Constipation
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
*  Pruritus (itching)
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects may include:

* Pulmonary toxicity (lung problems)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Infusion reactions (allergic reactions during infusion) including anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction).
* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) – a rare and serious brain infection.
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (severe skin reactions)

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). It consists of an antibody that specifically targets the CD30 protein found on the surface of certain lymphoma cells, linked to a powerful anticancer drug (monomethyl auristatin E or MMAE).

The antibody acts like a homing device, delivering the MMAE directly to the cancerous cells. Once inside the cell, MMAE disrupts the microtubules—essential components of the cell's structure and function—leading to cell death (apoptosis).  This targeted approach minimizes damage to healthy cells, although some side effects are still possible.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Brentuximab vedotin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or any of its components.
* **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML):** This is a serious and potentially fatal brain infection. Brentuximab vedotin is contraindicated in patients with PML and should be used with extreme caution in those at increased risk.
* **Pulmonary Toxicity:**  Concurrent use with bleomycin is contraindicated due to increased risk of pulmonary toxicity.  Monitor closely for any lung issues.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment.  Brentuximab vedotin should be avoided in patients with moderate to severe hepatic or renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Certain medications can affect the levels of Brentuximab vedotin in the blood, so it's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.  
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Brentuximab vedotin is categorized as pregnancy category D (potential risk to the fetus).  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not use this medication.  Effective contraception is essential for women of childbearing age during treatment and for at least six months after.
* **Fertility:** Brentuximab vedotin may impair male fertility.
