# Befunolol
### Generic Name
Befunolol

### Usage
Befunolol is primarily used to treat ocular hypertension (high pressure inside the eye) and open-angle glaucoma.  These conditions can damage the optic nerve, leading to vision loss. Befunolol helps lower intraocular pressure, thereby reducing the risk of vision impairment.  It's important to note that Befunolol does not cure glaucoma or ocular hypertension, but rather helps manage these conditions.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For both ocular hypertension and open-angle glaucoma, the usual dose is one drop of Befunolol ophthalmic solution (available in 0.25%, 0.5%, or 1% concentrations) in the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID). The specific concentration will be determined by your doctor.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Befunolol in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children unless specifically directed by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised when using Befunolol in patients with liver problems. Always consult with your doctor before using this medication if you have liver or kidney disease.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of Befunolol may include:

* Headache
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Conjunctival hyperemia (redness of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inside of the eyelid)
* Burning sensation in the eye
* Stinging
* Blurred vision
* Blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelid)
* Keratitis (inflammation of the cornea)
* Contact dermatitis, urticaria (hives), eczema, and pruritus (itching)
* Asthma (in susceptible individuals)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious adverse reactions.


### How it Works
Befunolol is a non-selective beta-blocker. It works by decreasing the production of aqueous humor, the fluid within the eye. By reducing the amount of fluid produced, the pressure inside the eye (intraocular pressure) is lowered. This helps to protect the optic nerve from damage.


### Precautions
Befunolol is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to Befunolol or any component of the formulation
* Sinus bradycardia (slow heart rhythm)
* Cardiogenic shock (shock caused by heart failure)
* Overt cardiac failure (severe heart failure)
* Second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (a type of heart block)
* Bronchial asthma or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)


Use with caution in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to other beta-blockers
* Diabetes mellitus
* Congestive heart failure
* Existing or a history of depression
* Hepatic impairment
* Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)
* Myasthenia gravis (a neuromuscular disorder)
* Peripheral vascular disease (PVD)
* Mild-to-moderate pulmonary impairment (e.g., bronchitis and emphysema)


Befunolol may mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and hyperthyroidism.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, as interactions can occur.  The safety of Befunolol during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Consult your physician before using Befunolol if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
