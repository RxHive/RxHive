# Boric Acid + Chlorbutol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Sodium Chloride + Sulphacetamide

This combination of Boric Acid + Chlorbutol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Sodium Chloride + Sulphacetamide is not a standard, pre-approved pharmaceutical formulation with a single generic name.  Therefore, providing detailed information in the requested format is impossible.  Each ingredient has its own uses and side effects, and the combination's effects depend entirely on the specific ratios and intended application.  This is likely a compounded preparation, meaning it's mixed by a pharmacist based on a doctor's prescription for a specific patient need.

To get accurate information, you **must consult the prescribing physician or pharmacist** who prepared the medication. They can explain the specific intended use, possible side effects, and mechanism of action based on the exact formulation.
