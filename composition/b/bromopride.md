# Bromopride
### Generic Name
Bromopride

### Usage
Bromopride is primarily used as an antiemetic to treat nausea and vomiting.  Its applications span various conditions, including postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), nausea and vomiting associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD or GORD), and nausea associated with gastrointestinal motility disorders.  It's also employed to prepare patients for endoscopy or radiographic examinations of the gastrointestinal tract.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the route of administration (oral, intramuscular (IM), or intravenous (IV)) and the patient's age and renal function.

**Adults:**

* **Gastroesophageal reflux, gastrointestinal motility disorders, nausea and vomiting, radiological procedures (gastrointestinal):**
    * IM/IV: 10-20 mg/day.
    * Oral: 10 mg every 8-12 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 60 mg.

**Children (over 1 year of age and adolescents):**

* **Gastroesophageal reflux, gastrointestinal motility disorders, nausea and vomiting, radiological procedures (gastrointestinal):**
    * IM/IV: 0.5-1 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum daily dose of 10-20 mg.
    * Oral (solution): 0.5-1 mg/kg/day (or 3-6 drops/kg/day using a 4 mg/mL solution) in three divided doses, with a maximum daily dose of 60 mg.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by manufacturers.
* **Renal Impairment:** For creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 40 mL/minute, no dosage adjustment is needed.  For CrCl < 40 mL/minute, reduce the initial dose by 50%, and adjust further based on clinical response.


### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Lassitude
* Restlessness

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Extrapyramidal reactions (more frequent in children and young adults) –  These involve involuntary muscle movements.
* Headache
* Insomnia
* Movement disorders
* Skin rash
* Urticaria (hives)
* Galactorrhea (breast milk production in non-lactating individuals)
* Gynecomastia (breast development in males)
* Hot flashes
* Gastrointestinal issues (worsening of existing gastrointestinal problems, nausea)

If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Bromopride is a dopamine antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, at receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. By blocking dopamine in the GI tract, it enhances gut motility—increasing the strength and frequency of stomach contractions—and relaxes the pyloric sphincter (the muscle between the stomach and small intestine), leading to faster gastric emptying.  It also increases the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter, helping to prevent acid reflux.


### Precautions
Bromopride is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to bromopride or any component of the formulation.

Use caution in patients with:

* Breast cancer
* Diabetes
* Glaucoma
* Hypertension
* Parkinson's disease
* Renal impairment

Bromopride is not recommended for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to insufficient data on its safety.

Bromopride may interact with lithium, potentially increasing lithium toxicity.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking bromopride?**
A:  Bromopride can cause drowsiness; therefore, driving or operating machinery should be avoided until you know how the medication affects you.
