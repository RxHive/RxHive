# Bromelain + Trypsin + Rutoside

**Generic Name:** Bromelain + Trypsin + Rutoside (Combination)

**Usage:**  This combination is typically used to reduce inflammation and swelling, particularly after surgery, injury, or in conditions like osteoarthritis.  Each component contributes to this effect: bromelain is a proteolytic enzyme from pineapple stems, trypsin is a digestive enzyme, and rutoside (a bioflavonoid) improves capillary permeability and reduces inflammation.  The exact use and dosage will depend on the specific formulation and the prescribing physician's judgment.  It's crucial to note that this combination is not FDA-approved for all uses and is often used off-label.

**Side Effects:** Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort. This is more likely with higher doses.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Skin rashes, itching, swelling.  This is particularly possible with bromelain, as it's a plant-derived enzyme.
* **Bleeding:**  Trypsin and bromelain have anti-coagulant properties; therefore, it may increase bleeding risk, especially when combined with anticoagulant medications.
* **Interactions with medications:**  May interact with anticoagulants (blood thinners), aspirin, and other medications affecting blood clotting or digestion.

**How it Works:**

* **Bromelain:**  Reduces inflammation by inhibiting certain inflammatory mediators. It also has fibrinolytic properties, meaning it can break down blood clots.
* **Trypsin:**  A proteolytic enzyme that breaks down proteins, potentially reducing inflammation and swelling by breaking down damaged tissue.  It also reduces the formation of fibrin.
* **Rutoside:**  A bioflavonoid that strengthens capillary walls, reducing permeability and leakage, thus decreasing swelling and inflammation.  It also possesses antioxidant properties.

The combination synergistically enhances the anti-inflammatory and anti-edema effects of each individual component.
