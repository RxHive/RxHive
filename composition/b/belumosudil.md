# Belumosudil
### Generic Name
Belumosudil

### Usage
Belumosudil is a medication used to treat chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) in adults and children aged 12 years and older.  It's specifically indicated for patients who haven't responded well to at least two other systemic therapies for cGVHD.  cGVHD is a serious complication that can occur after a stem cell transplant, where the transplanted cells attack the recipient's body.  Belumosudil helps to manage the symptoms and progression of this condition.  Currently, it does not have other approved uses.


### Dosage

**Adults and Children (â‰¥12 years):** The usual dose is 200 mg taken orally once daily.  Treatment continues until the cGVHD progresses to the point where additional systemic therapy is required, or until intolerable side effects occur.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. For those with severe hepatic impairment, the risks and benefits of using belumosudil should be carefully considered by a healthcare professional.  If liver enzyme levels (AST or ALT) rise significantly during treatment, the medication may need to be temporarily stopped or permanently discontinued, depending on the severity.

* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustments are typically recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  For patients with severe renal impairment, a careful assessment of risks and benefits is necessary before starting belumosudil.

* **Drug Interactions:** The dose of belumosudil may need to be increased to 200mg twice daily if it is used with strong CYP3A4 inducers (medications that increase the breakdown of belumosudil) or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

### How it Works

Belumosudil is a kinase inhibitor.  It primarily works by selectively inhibiting ROCK2 (a type of enzyme called rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase).  By inhibiting ROCK2, belumosudil helps to regulate the immune system, reducing the inflammatory and fibrotic processes associated with cGVHD.  Specifically, it downregulates STAT3 phosphorylation, decreases Th17 transcription factors, and upregulates STAT5, ultimately helping to restore a balance within the immune system and reduce the harmful effects of cGVHD.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Belumosudil can harm a developing fetus.  Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant should not use this medication.  Effective contraception is necessary during treatment and for at least one week after the last dose.

* **Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown whether belumosudil is excreted in breast milk.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for at least one week after the last dose.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Belumosudil's metabolism can be affected by other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Patients with liver or kidney problems may require careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I crush or chew the belumosudil tablet?** A: No, the tablet should be swallowed whole.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day and continue with your regular schedule the following day.  Do not double the dose.
