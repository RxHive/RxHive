# Bamifylline
### Generic Name
Bamifylline

### Usage

Bamifylline is primarily used to treat bronchial asthma and other pulmonary (lung) diseases that involve bronchospasm (constriction of the airways).  This includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a spastic component and asthmatic bronchitis.  It helps relax the muscles around the airways, making breathing easier.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Bronchial Asthma (Oral):**  The starting dose is typically 600-900 mg per day, divided into 2-3 doses. This may be increased to a maximum of 2800 mg per day in 3 divided doses if needed, based on individual response and physician recommendation.
* **Bronchial Asthma (Intravenous/Intramuscular):** 600 mg per day in two divided doses.
* **Bronchitis/COPD (Oral):** 600 mg twice daily (BID).


**Children:**  Dosage for children is significantly different and depends on age and weight.  Always follow the precise instructions given by a doctor or pharmacist.

* **Children under 2 years old (Bronchial Asthma/Pulmonary Diseases with Bronchospasm):**  Rectal suppositories (250 mg) – half a suppository twice daily.  Avoid giving doses too close together.
* **Children 2 years and older (Bronchial Asthma/Pulmonary Diseases with Bronchospasm):**  Rectal suppositories (250 mg) – one suppository twice daily. Avoid giving doses too close together.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Use in such cases should be approached with caution, under close medical supervision.

### Side Effects

* **Common (1-10%):** Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), dehydration, increased urination (diuresis), agitation, hives (urticaria), itching, rash, dermatitis, and headache.
* **Less Common (but Serious):** While less frequent, serious side effects are possible.  It's crucial to seek immediate medical attention if any unusual or worsening symptoms occur.

### How it Works

Bamifylline is a methylxanthine derivative that acts as a selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist. It also non-selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). By inhibiting phosphodiesterase, bamifylline increases cAMP levels. Increased cAMP levels lead to relaxation of the smooth muscles surrounding the airways, thereby relieving bronchospasm and improving airflow.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Bamifylline is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to bamifylline or other xanthines, and in those with acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).

**Warnings/Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using bamifylline in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, newborns and infants, advanced heart failure, severe arterial hypertension (high blood pressure), gastric ulcers, and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).

**Other Considerations:** Bamifylline should not be taken simultaneously with other xanthine preparations.  Caution is also advised when using it with ephedrine or other sympathomimetic bronchodilators.  Oral administration is recommended before meals.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take bamifylline with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking. Some interactions may occur, particularly with other xanthine derivatives or sympathomimetic bronchodilators.

* **Q: How should I store bamifylline?** A: Store bamifylline as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is close to the time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: Is bamifylline safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** A: Use of bamifylline is not recommended during the first months of pregnancy, the last few days of pregnancy, or during lactation (breastfeeding).  Consult your doctor for advice on alternative treatments.
