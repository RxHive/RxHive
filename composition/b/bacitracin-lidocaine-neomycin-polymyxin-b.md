# Bacitracin + Lidocaine + Neomycin + Polymyxin B
### Generic Name
Bacitracin + Lidocaine + Neomycin + Polymyxin B


### Usage

This combination drug is a topical antibiotic ointment used to treat minor bacterial skin infections.  It's primarily used for cuts, scrapes, burns (minor), and other wounds that are susceptible to infection. The combination of antibiotics targets a broad range of bacteria commonly causing such infections.  Lidocaine, a local anesthetic, is included to numb the area and reduce pain upon application.  It's crucial to remember that this ointment is for *superficial* skin infections only and is not suitable for deep wounds, puncture wounds, or serious infections requiring systemic antibiotics.


### Dosage

This medication is for topical use only.  Apply a thin layer to the affected area 2-3 times daily.  Clean the wound thoroughly before applying the ointment.  

* **Adults and Children:** Dosage is based on the size of the affected area. A small amount is generally sufficient to cover the wound. Avoid overapplication.

* **Oral administration is not applicable** as this is a topical ointment.

* **Intravenous (IV) administration is not applicable.** This medication is formulated exclusively for topical use.

Different formulations may exist (e.g., varying concentrations of the active ingredients), so always follow the instructions provided on your specific product packaging.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Mild stinging or burning sensation upon application, temporary redness, rash.  These usually resolve quickly.

* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis – difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue), skin irritation, hypersensitivity.  

**If you experience any allergic reaction or unusual side effects, discontinue use immediately and contact a healthcare professional.**


### How it Works

This combination ointment works by fighting against bacterial infections. Bacitracin, neomycin, and polymyxin B are all antibiotics that interfere with bacterial growth and reproduction in different ways.  They target a broad spectrum of bacteria, preventing further infection.  Lidocaine, a local anesthetic, provides temporary pain relief by blocking nerve impulses in the treated area.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Do not use if you are allergic to any of the components (bacitracin, lidocaine, neomycin, polymyxin B) or any other similar antibiotics (aminoglycosides).  An allergy to one aminoglycoside may indicate potential allergy to others.

* **Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women:** Consult your doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

* **Children:** Use only as directed by a doctor.

* **Large or Deep Wounds:**  This is not suitable for severe or deep wounds.  Seek medical attention for these.

* **Drug Interactions:**  While unlikely with topical application, inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking, especially other topical medications applied to the same area.

* **Long-Term Use:** Prolonged use may lead to the growth of resistant bacteria.  If your symptoms don't improve after a few days, or if they worsen, consult a doctor.

* **Do not apply to eyes or mucous membranes.**
