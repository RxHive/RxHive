# Bacitracin + Lidocaine + Neomycin + Polymyxin B

**Generic Name:** Bacitracin/Lidocaine/Neomycin/Polymyxin B topical ointment (various brand names exist)

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical antibiotic used to treat minor cuts, scrapes, burns, and other skin wounds to prevent infection.  Lidocaine provides temporary pain relief.  It is typically applied topically to the affected area.  **Important Note:**  This medication is for external use only and should not be applied to deep wounds, serious burns, or puncture wounds.  Always consult a doctor before using this medication on children or if the wound shows signs of significant infection (e.g., increasing pain, swelling, redness, pus).

**Side Effects:** Common side effects may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Mild skin irritation (redness, itching, rash)
* Allergic reactions (rare but possible, potentially serious):  Symptoms can include hives, swelling, difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.


**How it Works:**

* **Bacitracin:** A polypeptide antibiotic that interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis, preventing bacterial growth.  It is effective against Gram-positive bacteria.
* **Neomycin:** An aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, also preventing bacterial growth.  Effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
* **Polymyxin B:** A polypeptide antibiotic that disrupts bacterial cell membranes, leading to bacterial cell death.  Effective against Gram-negative bacteria.
* **Lidocaine:** A local anesthetic that blocks nerve impulses, providing temporary pain relief at the application site.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long should I use this medication?**  A:  Generally, use as directed by your doctor or for a few days until the wound shows signs of healing. Prolonged use is not recommended, as it could lead to resistance.
* **Q: Can I use this on my face?** A: It's best to avoid using it on the face unless specifically directed by a doctor. The face is sensitive skin.
* **Q: Can I use a bandage over the ointment?** A: Yes, you may use a sterile bandage to cover the treated area, especially for open wounds. This helps protect the wound and keep the ointment in place.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: This medication is typically applied as needed. There's no need to worry about missed doses.  However, continue using it as prescribed for the duration of treatment.
* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally ingest some of the ointment?** A: If ingestion occurs, contact your doctor or a poison control center immediately.
* **Q:  What if my symptoms don't improve or worsen?** A:  Consult your doctor.  The wound may require different treatment.  Worsening symptoms may indicate a more serious infection.
* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A: While rare with topical application, it's always best to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies.
