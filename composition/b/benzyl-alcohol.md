# Benzyl Alcohol
### Generic Name
Benzyl Alcohol

### Usage

Benzyl alcohol is a versatile topical medication with two primary uses:

1. **Treatment of Head Lice:**  It's used as a pediculicide (a substance that kills lice) in a lotion formulation (typically 5%) for head lice infestations in individuals aged 6 months and older.  Benzyl alcohol works by interfering with the respiratory system of lice, leading to their death.  It's important to note that it doesn't kill lice eggs (nits), so a thorough combing is usually necessary to remove these.

2. **Relief of Oral Pain:**  In gel (typically 10%) or ointment (typically 1%) formulations, benzyl alcohol provides temporary relief from pain and discomfort associated with various oral conditions. These include cold sores, fever blisters, canker sores, mouth sores, and gum irritations.  It's approved for use in individuals aged 2 years and older for this purpose.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the formulation and the condition being treated:

**Head Lice Infestation (Lotion, 5%):**

* **Adults and children (6 months and older):** The amount of lotion needed depends on hair length.  The product label will provide specific guidance, but generally, more lotion is needed for longer hair.  Apply to dry hair until saturated, leave on for 10 minutes, then rinse thoroughly.  Repeat the treatment after 7 days.

**Oral Pain:**

* **Gel (10%):** For adults and children (2 years and older), apply a small amount to the affected area up to four times daily.  Do not exceed 7 days of use unless directed by a healthcare professional.
* **Ointment (1%):** Apply a small amount to the affected area as needed.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Pruritus (itching)
* Erythema (redness)
* Local irritation
* Local pain
* Eye irritation (if contact occurs)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects:

* Contact dermatitis
* Skin rash
* Swelling
* Allergic reactions

**If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe or persistent ones, consult a healthcare professional immediately.**

### How it Works

**Head Lice:** Benzyl alcohol acts as a pediculicide by disrupting the respiratory system of lice, effectively suffocating them.  This is achieved by blocking the lice's spiracles (tiny openings used for breathing).

**Oral Pain:** The mechanism of action for pain relief isn't fully understood but is likely related to its local anesthetic properties, which can temporarily numb the affected area.

### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Avoid use if you have a known allergy to benzyl alcohol or any other ingredients in the formulation.
* **Eye Contact:** Avoid contact with eyes.  If contact occurs, flush thoroughly with water.
* **Infants and Children:** Use with caution in infants and young children, particularly for head lice treatment in infants under 6 months old, due to the potential for increased absorption.  For oral pain, gel formulations are not recommended for children under 2 years old.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While considered a Category B drug (lotion formulation) for pregnancy, it's best to consult your doctor before using benzyl alcohol if you're pregnant or breastfeeding.  The excretion of benzyl alcohol lotion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Other Medications:**  There are no known significant interactions with other medications, but it's always advisable to inform your healthcare professional about all medications you are taking.
* **Duration of Use:**  Do not use for more than 7 days unless directed by a healthcare professional.  If symptoms worsen or don't improve, discontinue use and seek medical advice.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: For head lice, it typically takes 10 minutes of application time, followed by rinsing. For oral pain, relief is generally quick, but the duration depends on the formulation and the severity of the condition.

* **Q: How should I store benzyl alcohol?** A: Store according to the instructions on the product label.  Generally, this means storing in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat.

* **Q: Is it safe to use with other lice treatments?** A: It's crucial to follow the instructions on the product label.  Don't mix benzyl alcohol with other lice treatments without consulting a healthcare professional.

* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally ingest benzyl alcohol?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if accidental ingestion occurs.

* **Q: Can I use this on my pets?** A: No, benzyl alcohol is intended for human use only.  Do not use on animals.
