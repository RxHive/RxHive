# Brimonidine + Stabilized Oxychloro

The combination of brimonidine and stabilized oxychloro is not a standard, approved combination drug.  Brimonidine and oxytetracycline (the active ingredient in some formulations of oxychloro) are used separately in ophthalmology, but not typically together in a single preparation.  Therefore, I cannot provide details about a generic "Brimonidine + Stabilized Oxychloro" as such a product doesn't exist in commonly available pharmaceutical markets.

To offer helpful information, I can provide details on brimonidine and oxytetracycline separately:
