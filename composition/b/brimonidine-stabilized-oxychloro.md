# Brimonidine + Stabilized Oxychloro
### Generic Name
Brimonidine Tartrate + Timolol Maleate (Fixed Combination)

**Note:**  There is no single generic medicine called "Brimonidine + Stabilized Oxychloro."  Brimonidine is often combined with Timolol Maleate, not Oxychloro, to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension.  This information describes the common combination of Brimonidine Tartrate and Timolol Maleate.  "Stabilized Oxychloro" is not a recognized pharmaceutical term.


### Usage

Brimonidine Tartrate/Timolol Maleate is a fixed combination ophthalmic solution primarily used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with:

* **Open-angle glaucoma:** A condition where the fluid drainage channels in the eye become clogged, causing a buildup of pressure.
* **Ocular hypertension:**  Elevated IOP without the characteristic damage to the optic nerve seen in glaucoma.  Lowering IOP helps prevent or delay the onset of glaucoma-related vision loss.


This combination therapy is typically prescribed when a single medication isn't sufficient to control IOP.  Brimonidine and Timolol work through different mechanisms, providing a synergistic effect in lowering IOP.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions are crucial and should always be followed exactly as prescribed by an ophthalmologist.  This information is for general knowledge and does not substitute professional medical advice.

**Typical Dosage (Ophthalmic Solution):**

* **Adults:**  One or two drops in the affected eye(s) once or twice daily, depending on the physician's instructions.  The exact dosage depends on individual response and the severity of the condition.
* **Children:** The safety and efficacy of this combination in children haven't been established, so it's generally not recommended for pediatric use.  Alternative treatments would be considered.

**Administration:**

* Gently pull down the lower eyelid to create a pocket.
* Instill the prescribed number of drops into the pocket.
* Close the eye gently and apply gentle pressure to the inner corner of the eye (near the nose) for about one minute to prevent the medication from draining into the tear duct.
* Wait at least 5-10 minutes between applying different eye drops to avoid interactions.
* Wash your hands before and after administering the medication.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye
* Eye redness
* Eye dryness
* Itching
* Blurred vision
* Headache
* Fatigue

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (such as swelling of the face, lips, or throat)
* Changes in heart rate or blood pressure (more likely with Timolol)
* Breathing problems (more likely with Timolol, especially in patients with asthma or COPD)
* Depression


**If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

Brimonidine Tartrate is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist. It works by decreasing the production of aqueous humor (the fluid inside the eye) and increasing its outflow, thus lowering IOP.

Timolol Maleate is a beta-blocker. It reduces IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous humor.  The combination of these two drugs provides a more effective reduction in IOP than either drug alone.



### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:** Do not use if you are allergic to brimonidine, timolol, or any other ingredients in the formulation.
* **Heart Conditions:** Timolol can worsen certain heart conditions. Discuss your heart health with your doctor before using this medication.
* **Lung Conditions:**  Timolol can worsen lung conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Discuss this with your physician.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established. Consult your doctor.
* **Other Medications:** Inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  Interactions can occur.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Blurred vision is a possible side effect. Use caution when driving or operating machinery.
* **Contact Lenses:**  Remove contact lenses before applying the eye drops and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The effect on IOP usually begins within an hour and reaches its peak within 2-4 hours.  The full benefit may take several weeks to develop.
* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store the medication at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: Can I stop using it suddenly?** A: No, stopping abruptly can cause a sudden increase in IOP.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for discontinuation.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember.  If it's almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I use this medication with other eye drops?** A:  Discuss with your doctor before using other eye drops concurrently.  Allow sufficient time between different eye drop applications to avoid dilution and reduced efficacy.
