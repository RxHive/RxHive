# Benzyl Benzoate
### Generic Name
Benzyl Benzoate

### Usage
Benzyl benzoate is primarily used topically to treat infestations of scabies mites (*Sarcoptes scabiei*) and lice (pediculosis).  While effective, it's not always the first-line treatment for scabies due to its potential for skin irritation.  Its use in lice treatment is more common.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the condition and the patient's age.  Always follow the instructions on the product label or your healthcare provider's guidance.

**Scabies:**

* **Adults and Children:** A 25% lotion is typically applied three times at 12-hour intervals over the entire body.  Special attention should be paid to skin folds, creases, and areas between fingers and toes. The skin must be thoroughly washed and dried before each application.

**Pediculosis (Lice):**

* **Adults and Children:**  A 25% lotion is applied to the affected area(s) and left on for 24 hours before rinsing.  For head lice, wrapping a towel around the hair after application may be helpful. A fine-toothed comb should be used to remove dead lice and nits.  Retreatment may be necessary after 7 and 14 days if the infestation persists.


**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specified in standard manufacturer's labeling. Always consult a doctor if you have liver or kidney problems before using this medication.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Burning sensation, skin rash (erythematous rash), contact dermatitis, application site irritation.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), eye irritation, nasal mucosa irritation.

If any adverse effects occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
The exact mechanism of benzyl benzoate's action isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to affect the nervous system of the parasites (mites and lice), leading to their death and ultimately eliminating the infestation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Benzyl benzoate should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to benzyl benzoate.  Avoid application to broken skin (wounds, burns) as absorption may be increased.

* **Cautions:** Use with caution in individuals with a history of allergic reactions to other topical products.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using this medication. While generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding (according to WHO guidelines), individual assessments are important.

* **Children:**  Dilution may be recommended for children under 12 years old. Always follow a healthcare professional's guidance for pediatric use.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The effectiveness of benzyl benzoate varies, but relief from symptoms of scabies and lice should be observed within days of starting treatment.  Complete eradication might take longer, possibly requiring retreatment.

* **Q: Can I use it on my face?** A:  Use caution when applying near the eyes or mucous membranes.  If application to the face is necessary, avoid contact with the eyes and nose.

* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store benzyl benzoate at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: For scabies treatment, try to apply the medication as close to the scheduled time as possible. If you miss a dose significantly, consult your doctor for advice on how to proceed. For lice, adhering to the recommended schedule is important, but missing a single application might not significantly affect the outcome if subsequent treatments are given.

* **Q:  What should I do if I have an allergic reaction?** A: Stop using benzyl benzoate immediately and seek medical attention.  Allergic reactions can range in severity, and prompt medical care is crucial.
