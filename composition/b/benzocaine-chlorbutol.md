# Benzocaine + Chlorbutol

**Generic Name:** Benzocaine + Chlorobutanol

**Usage:**

Benzocaine + Chlorobutanol is a combination of a local anesthetic (benzocaine) and a preservative (chlorobutanol).  It's commonly found in topical preparations for relieving pain and discomfort associated with minor skin irritations, such as:

* Minor burns
* Sunburns
* Minor cuts and scrapes
* Insect bites and stings
* Sore throats (in lozenges or sprays)


**Side Effects:**

* **Local Reactions:** The most common side effects are localized to the application site and can include burning, stinging, redness, itching, and swelling.  Allergic contact dermatitis is possible.
* **Rare but Serious Reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions can occur, ranging from mild hives to severe reactions like anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction).  These require immediate medical attention.
* **Systemic Effects:**  Absorption of benzocaine through the skin can rarely lead to methemoglobinemia, a condition where the blood's ability to carry oxygen is reduced. This is more likely with large application areas or prolonged use. Symptoms include bluish discoloration of the skin (cyanosis), shortness of breath, headache, and fatigue.  Chlorobutanol can cause drowsiness or dizziness, though these are less common with topical applications.

**How it Works:**

* **Benzocaine:**  This is a local anesthetic that works by blocking nerve signals in the affected area, preventing pain sensations from reaching the brain.
* **Chlorobutanol:**  This acts as a preservative, preventing the growth of bacteria and fungi in the product, extending its shelf life and maintaining its sterility.

* **What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?**  Stop use immediately and seek medical attention.  Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.
