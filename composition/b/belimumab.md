# Belimumab
### Generic Name
Belimumab

### Usage
Belimumab is a prescription medication used to treat adults and children (5 years and older) with active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  It's particularly useful for those already receiving standard therapy.  Belimumab is also indicated for adults with active lupus nephritis (kidney inflammation caused by lupus), again in conjunction with standard therapy.  It's important to note that Belimumab is *not* recommended for patients with severe active central nervous system (CNS) lupus or when used in combination with other biologic medications.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Premedication before intravenous administration is often considered to help prevent hypersensitivity and infusion reactions.

**Adults:**

* **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):**
    * **Intravenous (IV):** Initial dose of 10 mg/kg every two weeks for three doses, followed by a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg every four weeks.
    * **Subcutaneous (SubQ):** 200 mg once weekly.  Switching from IV therapy: The first subcutaneous dose should be administered 1-4 weeks after the last intravenous dose.

* **Lupus Nephritis:**
    * **Intravenous (IV):** Initial dose of 10 mg/kg every two weeks for three doses, followed by a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg every four weeks.
    * **Subcutaneous (SubQ):** 400 mg once weekly for four doses, then 200 mg once weekly thereafter. Switching from IV therapy: Administer the first 200 mg SubQ dose 1-2 weeks after the last IV dose; switch to SubQ after two IV doses.


**Pediatric Patients (≥5 years):**

* **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):**
    * **Intravenous (IV):**  Initial dose of 10 mg/kg every two weeks for three doses, followed by a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg every four weeks.  For adolescents aged 18 and older, subcutaneous administration may be an option.
    * **Subcutaneous (SubQ):** 200 mg once weekly (preferably on the same day each week). Switching from IV therapy:  The first subcutaneous dose should be administered 1-4 weeks after the last intravenous dose.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### How it Works

Belimumab is a BLyS-specific inhibitor.  BLyS (B-lymphocyte stimulator) is a protein that helps B cells (a type of immune cell) survive.  Belimumab works by blocking BLyS, preventing it from binding to its receptors on B cells. This reduces the number of B cells, including those that might be contributing to the autoimmune activity in SLE and lupus nephritis, thereby lessening the inflammation and damage associated with these conditions.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Belimumab is contraindicated in patients who have had an anaphylactic reaction to it.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients taking Belimumab have an increased risk of serious and fatal infections, acute hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and death), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), depression and suicidality, infusion reactions, and malignancy.  It can also interfere with the response to immunizations.
* **Use with Caution:**  Use cautiously in patients with severe or chronic infections and in elderly patients.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Belimumab is generally not recommended during pregnancy and should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.  Effective contraception is advised during treatment and for at least four months afterward. Belimumab is excreted in breast milk; careful consideration should be given to the risks and benefits of breastfeeding while on this medication.  Infants of treated mothers should be monitored for B-cell reduction and other immune dysfunction.
