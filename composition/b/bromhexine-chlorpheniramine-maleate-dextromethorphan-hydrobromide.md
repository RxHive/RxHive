# Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Generic Name:** Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of the common cold or flu.  It typically treats coughs, runny nose, and sneezing.  Specifically:

* **Bromhexine:** A mucolytic agent that helps to thin and loosen mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that helps to dry up runny nose and reduce sneezing.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive) that helps to reduce the urge to cough.

This combination is often used for symptoms that include a productive cough (cough with phlegm) accompanied by a runny nose and sneezing.  It's important to note that it does *not* treat the underlying infection causing the cold or flu, only the symptoms.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness, headache, nausea, constipation.
* **Less Common:**  Blurred vision, nervousness, insomnia, upset stomach, vomiting.
* **Rare but Serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Bromhexine:** Works by reducing the stickiness of mucus, allowing it to be more easily expelled from the lungs.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This reduces the symptoms of a runny nose and sneezing.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
