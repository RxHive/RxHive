# Budesonide (Topical)
### Generic Name
Budesonide (Topical)

### Usage
Budesonide topical, in the form of rectal foam or enema, is primarily used to induce remission in adults with mild to moderate distal ulcerative colitis.  This refers to inflammation of the large intestine's lining, specifically affecting the lower portion (up to 40 cm from the anus).  It's crucial to understand that Budesonide topical is not for treating all forms of colitis or other gastrointestinal issues. Its use is specifically targeted at this particular condition and severity.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Ulcerative Colitis (Rectal Foam):** The usual starting dose is 2 mg (one metered dose) twice daily (BID) for two weeks.  This is followed by a maintenance dose of 2 mg once daily (OD) in the evening for four weeks.

* **Ulcerative Colitis (Rectal Enema):**  The typical initial dose is approximately 2 mg (one enema) once daily at night for four weeks. If remission isn't achieved, treatment might continue for another four weeks.  Total treatment duration with enemas usually doesn't exceed eight weeks.

**Pediatric Dosage:**
The safety and effectiveness of topical budesonide in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For mild impairment, no dosage adjustment is typically needed.  For moderate or severe impairment, the manufacturer doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for rectal foam or enemas, largely due to the low systemic absorption. However, close monitoring for signs of hypercortisolism (excess cortisol) is essential, and treatment should be stopped if such signs appear.

* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for either rectal foam or enemas due to the low systemic absorption.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  Decreased plasma cortisol levels (a hormone produced by the adrenal glands) is a common side effect, even exceeding 10% of cases.  Other side effects occurring in 1-10% of cases include nausea.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Less frequent, but potentially serious side effects include adrenal insufficiency (adrenal gland failure), HPA-axis suppression (suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis), hypercortisolism (excess cortisol), and various other reactions such as acne, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), mood changes (anxiety, depression), gastrointestinal issues (diarrhea, flatulence), and skin rashes.

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.  The list above is not exhaustive.


### How it Works

Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid, a type of steroid hormone. It works by reducing inflammation in the affected area of the bowel.  This happens at a cellular level by influencing the body's immune response, impacting protein synthesis, and affecting the movement and activity of cells involved in the inflammatory process.  In simpler terms, it helps to calm the inflamed bowel lining and reduce the symptoms of ulcerative colitis.  It has potent glucocorticoid activity but weak mineralocorticoid activity, meaning it primarily affects inflammation and less so the body's salt and water balance.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Budesonide topical is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to budesonide or any formulation components. It is also contraindicated in cases of imminent bowel perforation, obstruction, abscess, other pyogenic infections, fresh intestinal anastomoses, extensive fistulas, and sinus tracts, as well as active tuberculosis or systemic/local bacterial, fungal, or viral infections.

* **Increased Risk:**  Use increases the risk of adrenal suppression, immunosuppression, and psychiatric disturbances. Patients transferred from other glucocorticoids may experience impaired adrenal suppression.

* **Cautious Use:**  Exercise caution in patients with hypertension, acute coronary disease, limited cardiac reserve, diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, hepatic impairment, myasthenia gravis, cataracts/glaucoma, osteoporosis, and the elderly.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Concurrent use with aldesleukin (an immune system stimulant) should be avoided.  Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (medications that inhibit a specific liver enzyme) may increase budesonide serum concentrations, necessitating caution or avoidance.  Grapefruit juice should also be avoided due to its interaction with this enzyme.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take to see results?**
A:  The time to see improvement varies among individuals.  It's typically assessed after the initial two to four weeks of treatment.

**Q: Can I use this medication if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**
A: Budesonide is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the risks are not fully established.  Consult your doctor before using it during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  While corticosteroids are generally considered compatible with breastfeeding for inflammatory bowel disease, cautious monitoring is warranted.

**Q: How should I store Budesonide topical?**
A: Follow the storage instructions on the product label.  Generally, this involves storing it at room temperature away from moisture and direct sunlight.

**Q: Can I stop taking Budesonide topical suddenly?**
A: No, you should never stop using budesonide topical abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms and potential complications.

**Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
