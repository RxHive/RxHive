# Bentazepam
### Generic Name
Bentazepam

### Usage
Bentazepam is a thienodiazepine, a type of benzodiazepine analog.  Its primary use is in managing anxiety, whether it stems from functional or organic disorders. This includes various mental behavioral changes like restlessness, fear, nervousness, irritability, social phobia, and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  While not its primary indication, bentazepam's sedative properties may also offer secondary benefits in certain situations where calmness and relaxation are needed. However, it's crucial to understand that bentazepam is not a first-line treatment for all anxiety disorders and should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage
Dosage for bentazepam varies depending on the individual and the severity of their condition.  Generally, for adults experiencing anxiety, the oral dosage is 25mg three times daily (TID), with a maximum daily dose of 150mg.  It's essential to start with the lowest effective dose and gradually increase it only if necessary, under medical supervision. Treatment duration should be kept as short as possible, ideally not exceeding 8-12 weeks, including a gradual tapering-off period to avoid withdrawal symptoms.  

For elderly patients or those with impaired liver or kidney function, a lower dose (1-2 tablets daily) is typically recommended.  Similarly, patients with chronic respiratory failure should receive reduced doses due to the risk of respiratory depression.  There is no specific pediatric dosage information provided in this context.  Always consult a physician for appropriate dosage and duration of treatment.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of bentazepam can include:

* Dry mouth
* Somnolence (sleepiness)
* Asthenia (weakness)
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Muscle weakness
* Ataxia (lack of coordination)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include:

* Severe liver damage (hepatitis)
* Drug-induced lymphocytic colitis
* Drowsiness
* Blunted affect (reduced emotional expression)
* Confusion
* Fatigue
* Diplopia (double vision)
* Changes in libido
* Skin reactions
* Anterograde amnesia (inability to form new memories)
* Restlessness
* Agitation
* Irritability
* Aggressiveness
* Delirium
* Fits of anger
* Nightmares
* Hallucinations
* Psychosis
* Inappropriate behavior


If any of these, or other unusual effects occur, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Bentazepam is a thienodiazepine, structurally similar to phenothiazines but with a thiophene ring replacing the benzene ring found in other benzodiazepines. It primarily works by enhancing the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve impulses in the brain.  By facilitating GABA's binding to its receptors, bentazepam reduces neuronal excitability, leading to its anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing), sedative, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects.


### Precautions
Bentazepam is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines or any component of the formulation; myasthenia gravis; sleep apnea syndrome; severe respiratory failure; and severe liver failure.

It should be used cautiously in patients with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those with a history of mental or physical drug dependency.  

Bentazepam can interact with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as antipsychotics, hypnotics, sedatives, antidepressants, narcotic analgesics, antiepileptics, anesthetics, and sedative antihistamines, potentially increasing the risk of CNS depression.  Concomitant use with narcotic analgesics may also enhance euphoric effects and increase the risk of dependence.

Use during pregnancy, especially the last trimester, is associated with the risk of physical dependence in the newborn.  Bentazepam is excreted in breast milk, making breastfeeding contraindicated during treatment.  Elderly patients and those with hepatic or renal impairment require careful dose adjustments or may be contraindicated altogether.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for bentazepam to work?** A: The onset of effects can vary, but it usually takes effect within a short time after administration.  However, the full therapeutic effect might take several days or weeks.

* **Q: Can I stop taking bentazepam suddenly?** A: No, abrupt cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms. Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually reducing the dose to avoid withdrawal.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking bentazepam?** A: No, alcohol can severely potentiate the CNS depressant effects of bentazepam, leading to dangerous consequences.  Alcohol should be strictly avoided.

* **Q: How should I store bentazepam?** A: Store as directed by your physician or pharmacist, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Is bentazepam habit-forming?** A: Like other benzodiazepines, bentazepam has a potential for dependence, especially with prolonged use.  It's crucial to adhere to the prescribed dosage and duration of treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.  Consult your doctor if you have concerns about missed doses.
