# Brivudine
### Generic Name
Brivudine

### Usage
Brivudine is primarily used for the early treatment of acute herpes zoster (shingles) infections in immunocompetent adults.  This means it's effective in adults with healthy immune systems who have recently developed shingles.  Treatment should ideally begin within 72 hours of the first skin manifestations (rash onset) or 48 hours of the appearance of the first blister for optimal results. It's important to note that Brivudine is not suitable for treating other viral infections.


### Dosage
**Adults (Herpes Zoster):** The recommended dose is 125 mg once daily (OD) for 7 days. Treatment should commence as early as possible, preferably within 72 hours of the onset of the rash or 48 hours after the appearance of the first blister.  Brivudine is administered orally in tablet form.

**Children:** Brivudine is contraindicated (not recommended) in children under 18 years of age due to a lack of established safety and efficacy data.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised when using Brivudine in patients with chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis.

### How it Works
Brivudine is a nucleoside analog of thymidine.  This means it's a molecule structurally similar to thymidine, a building block of DNA. Brivudine gets incorporated into the viral DNA of the herpes zoster virus, interfering with the action of DNA polymerases.  DNA polymerases are enzymes crucial for viral replication. By inhibiting these enzymes, Brivudine effectively blocks the virus from making copies of itself, thus suppressing the infection.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Brivudine is contraindicated in the following situations:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Brivudine or any component of the formulation.
* Patients undergoing or recently having undergone cancer chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or similar drugs.
* Patients currently using or recently having used antifungal therapy with flucytosine.
* Immunocompromised patients (weakened immune systems), such as those undergoing cancer chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy.
* Children under 18 years of age.
* Pregnant women.
* Breastfeeding women.

**Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with chronic liver disease such as hepatitis.


**Drug Interactions:** Avoid concomitant (simultaneous) use of Brivudine with fluorouracil.
