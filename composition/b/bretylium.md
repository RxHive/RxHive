# Bretylium
### Generic Name
Bretylium

### Usage
Bretylium is a class III antiarrhythmic drug primarily used to treat life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.  This means it's used in emergency situations where the heart's lower chambers are beating irregularly or too fast, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.  Specifically, its primary use is in cases of ventricular fibrillation (a chaotic, ineffective heartbeat) and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (a rapid heartbeat that doesn't pump blood effectively).  It's typically reserved for situations where other, more standard treatments haven't been successful.  Bretylium can be used prophylactically (preventatively) in some situations to reduce the risk of recurrence of these dangerous arrhythmias.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The dosage of Bretylium is highly dependent on the severity and type of arrhythmia and patient response.  It is usually administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM) by a healthcare professional in a hospital setting.

* **Ventricular Fibrillation and Hemodynamically Unstable Ventricular Tachycardia:**
    * **IV:** The initial dose is typically 5 mg/kg given over one minute.  If the arrhythmia persists, the dose may be increased to 10 mg/kg over one minute and repeated every 15-30 minutes as needed, up to a total dose of 30-35 mg/kg. For continuous suppression, a diluted solution may be used at a rate of 1-2 mg/min or 5-10 mg/kg over at least 8 minutes every 6 hours.
    * **IM:** For life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias other than ventricular fibrillation and unstable ventricular tachycardia, the initial dose is 5-10 mg/kg given over more than 8 minutes.  This may be repeated every 1-2 hours as needed.  Maintenance doses are typically 5-10 mg/kg every 6-8 hours (IM) or by IV infusion over at least 8 minutes every 6 hours at a rate of 1-2 mg/min.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Bretylium in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  While manufacturer labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, a longer dosing interval may be considered for those with renal impairment.  Always consult a medical professional for guidance on dose adjustments based on individual patient factors.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Hypotension (low blood pressure) is a very common side effect.
* **Other Possible Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, lightheadedness,  bradycardia (slow heart rate), syncope (fainting), and various other cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and neurological effects are possible.  Rarely, more serious side effects like psychosis can occur.

**Important Note:** This list is not exhaustive.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Bretylium is a class III antiarrhythmic agent. It works by prolonging the action potential duration and the effective refractory period in the heart's ventricles (lower chambers).  In simpler terms, it slows down the electrical signals that trigger the heart to contract, helping to restore a more regular rhythm.  Bretylium also affects the release of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that influences heart rate and blood pressure. While initially causing a release of norepinephrine (which can slightly raise blood pressure), it ultimately reduces norepinephrine release, contributing to its blood pressure-lowering effect.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Bretylium is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with digitalis-induced arrhythmias.
* **Interactions:** Bretylium can interact with numerous other medications, including other antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, cardiac glycosides, and drugs that prolong the QT interval.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications being taken.
* **Warnings:**  Bretylium can cause significant hypotension, and caution should be exercised in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, renal impairment, or in elderly patients.  It should be used cautiously in patients with bradycardia (slow heart rate). Pregnant and breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare provider before taking this medication.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take Bretylium to work?** A: The onset of action can vary but generally takes between 20 minutes and several hours.

* **Q: Can I take Bretylium at home?** A: No. Bretylium is usually only administered in a hospital setting by trained medical professionals because it requires close monitoring due to the risk of severe side effects like hypotension.

* **Q: How should Bretylium be stored?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above.
