It's crucial to understand that providing detailed information on a supplement combining Beta Carotene, Calcium Ascorbate, Coenzyme Q10, Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), Lycopene, Piperine, Selenium Dioxide, Vitamin B complex (which is itself a group of vitamins), Wheat Germ Oil, and Zinc Sulfate requires significant caution.  This is not a standardized formula, and the efficacy and safety depend heavily on the specific dosages and the interactions between these numerous ingredients.  **This information is for general knowledge only and should not be considered medical advice. Consult a healthcare professional before using any supplement.**
