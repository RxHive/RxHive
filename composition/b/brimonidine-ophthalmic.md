# Brimonidine (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Brimonidine (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Brimonidine ophthalmic solution is primarily used to lower elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in individuals with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  This reduction in IOP helps to protect the optic nerve and prevent vision loss associated with these conditions.  Additionally, brimonidine is available over-the-counter (OTC) in lower concentrations for the temporary relief of redness in the eye caused by minor irritations.  It's important to understand that the OTC formulation is for short-term symptom relief and does not address underlying eye conditions.


### Dosage

**Elevated Intraocular Pressure:**

* **Adults:** The dosage varies depending on the concentration of the solution.  For 0.1% or 0.15% solutions, the typical dose is one drop in the affected eye(s) three times daily (approximately every 8 hours). For 0.2% solutions, one drop in the affected eye(s) can be administered three times daily or twice daily (every 8-12 hours).

* **Children (≥2 years):**  One drop in the affected eye(s) three times daily (approximately every 8 hours) is generally recommended for all concentrations (0.1%, 0.15%, or 0.2%).  Brimonidine is contraindicated in children under 2 years of age.


**Ocular Redness (OTC, 0.025% solution):**

* **Adults and Children (≥5 years):** One drop in the affected eye(s) every 6-8 hours, up to four times daily.


**Important Administration Guidelines:**

* Always wash your hands before applying the drops.
* Tilt your head back and pull down your lower eyelid to create a pocket.
* Gently squeeze one drop into the pocket.
* After instilling the drops, gently press on the inner corner of your eye (near your nose) for about one minute to help prevent the medication from entering your bloodstream.
* Avoid touching the tip of the bottle to your eye or any surface.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Allergic conjunctivitis
* Conjunctival hyperemia (redness)

If you experience any significant or concerning side effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Brimonidine is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. This means it works by activating specific receptors in the eye, primarily reducing the production of aqueous humor (the fluid that fills the space between the cornea and the lens). This reduction in fluid production, along with increased outflow of aqueous humor, leads to a decrease in IOP.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Brimonidine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to brimonidine or any component of the formulation, neonates and infants under 2 years of age, and those currently using monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

* **Drug Interactions:**  Brimonidine can interact with hypotensive agents (blood pressure-lowering medications) and MAOIs.  Concurrent use with MAOIs is contraindicated.  Consult with a healthcare professional regarding potential interactions with other medications.

* **Specific Populations:** Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, coronary insufficiency, orthostatic hypotension, thromboangiitis obliterans, Raynaud phenomenon, depression, hepatic impairment, and renal impairment.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be approached with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

* **Other Warnings:**  Do not wear soft contact lenses while using this medication.  Wait at least 10-15 minutes after application before reinserting them.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if experiencing drowsiness or visual disturbances.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for brimonidine to work?** A: The effect on IOP usually starts within an hour, but the full effect may take longer.

* **Q: How should I store brimonidine?** A: Store brimonidine at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I use brimonidine with other eye drops?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist.  It's generally recommended to administer different eye drops at least 5 minutes apart.

* **Q:  Can I use brimonidine if I have other medical conditions?** A:  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions and medications before using brimonidine.
