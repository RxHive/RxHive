# Bempedoic acid + Rosuvastatin
### Generic Name
Bempedoic acid + Rosuvastatin

### Usage

Bempedoic acid and rosuvastatin is a combination medication used to lower high cholesterol levels in adults.  It's primarily prescribed for people who haven't reached their cholesterol goals with rosuvastatin alone or who can't tolerate higher doses of rosuvastatin.  This combination therapy works by targeting cholesterol production in the liver through two different mechanisms, providing a more effective approach to managing high cholesterol than either drug alone. The specific condition treated is hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol).  While this combination is not typically used in children, it’s crucial to consult a doctor to determine its suitability in specific cases.


### Dosage

Dosage of bempedoic acid/rosuvastatin should always be determined and supervised by a physician. There is no standard dosage range that applies universally. The prescription will be tailored to your individual needs and response to the medication.  Generally:

* **Oral:** The combination is administered orally, usually once daily, with or without food. The specific dose of each component (bempedoic acid and rosuvastatin) will be determined by your doctor based on your individual cholesterol levels and response to treatment.  Dosage forms typically combine a set amount of each medication per tablet.
* **IV Administration:** This combination is not administered intravenously (IV).  Bempedoic acid and rosuvastatin are oral medications.

**Variations:**  Dosage will vary depending on factors such as your current cholesterol levels, kidney function, and other medications you are taking.  Adjustments may be made based on your response to therapy.  Never alter your dosage without consulting your doctor.  Children should not typically take this medicine.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Muscle aches (myalgia)
* Headache
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Back pain

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* Rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle breakdown—seek immediate medical attention)
* Liver damage (jaundice, unusual fatigue)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

**Important:** If you experience any concerning side effects, especially muscle pain, weakness, or dark urine, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Bempedoic acid and rosuvastatin work together to reduce cholesterol levels in the body.  Bempedoic acid inhibits an enzyme (ATP-citrate lyase) involved in cholesterol production in the liver. This reduces the liver’s ability to create cholesterol. Rosuvastatin is a statin, which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, another key enzyme in cholesterol production.  By blocking these two enzymes in different steps of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, the combination provides a more potent effect than either drug alone, resulting in a more significant reduction in cholesterol levels. This leads to lowered levels of "bad" LDL cholesterol and improved overall lipid profile.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with severe liver disease, pre-existing muscle disorders (myopathies), or hypersensitivity to bempedoic acid or rosuvastatin. Pregnancy and breastfeeding are also contraindications.
* **Drug Interactions:** Bempedoic acid and rosuvastatin can interact with several other medications, including some antifungals, antibiotics, and other lipid-lowering drugs.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Close monitoring of liver and kidney function is necessary, particularly in individuals with pre-existing conditions.  Muscle pain or weakness should be reported to your doctor immediately.  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  A:  While moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, excessive alcohol intake can increase the risk of liver damage, which is already a potential side effect of this combination.  Consult your doctor.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the medication at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A:  No, never stop taking this medication abruptly.  Stopping it suddenly could lead to a rebound increase in cholesterol levels.  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: Is this medication safe for pregnant women?** A: No, this medication is contraindicated during pregnancy.
