# Benzocaine + Chloramphenicol

**Generic Name:** Benzocaine + Chloramphenicol

**Usage:** This combination is typically used as a topical anesthetic and antimicrobial agent for the treatment of minor skin infections, burns, and wounds that are accompanied by pain and inflammation.  It's often found in ointments or creams.  *Important Note:*  The specific formulation and intended use can vary depending on the manufacturer and the country of origin.  Always consult the product labeling for accurate information.  The use of this combination is becoming less common due to concerns regarding chloramphenicol.

**Side Effects:**

* **Benzocaine:**  Allergic reactions (ranging from mild skin irritation to severe anaphylaxis), methemoglobinemia (a serious blood disorder), dizziness, drowsiness.
* **Chloramphenicol:**  Aplastic anemia (a rare but potentially fatal blood disorder), bone marrow suppression, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes.  It's crucial to note that chloramphenicol's serious side effects heavily outweigh its benefits in many cases, making its inclusion in topical preparations questionable.


**How it Works:**

* **Benzocaine:**  This is a local anesthetic that works by blocking nerve signals in the affected area, providing temporary pain relief.  It numbs the area, making it less sensitive to pain and other stimuli.
* **Chloramphenicol:** This is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, thereby stopping the growth and reproduction of bacteria.
