# Bethanechol
### Generic Name
Bethanechol

### Usage

Bethanechol is primarily used to treat urinary retention, specifically the nonobstructive (functional) type that occurs after surgery or childbirth.  It's also used to manage neurogenic bladder atony, a condition where the bladder doesn't contract properly, leading to urine retention.  While not its primary indication, Bethanechol has seen off-label use in managing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and mitigating some side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and phenothiazines.  However, it's crucial to remember that these are off-label uses, and a doctor should always be consulted before using Bethanechol for anything beyond its approved indications.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Urinary Retention/Neurogenic Bladder (Oral):** The initial dose is typically 5-10 mg three or four times daily (TID or QID).  This dose may be increased by 5-10 mg hourly as needed, up to a maximum of 10-50 mg TID or QID.  Some individuals might require higher doses (50-100 mg QID), but this should only be determined by a physician.  Remember, higher doses can lead to cumulative cholinergic effects.

* **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) - Off-Label (Oral):**  A common off-label dosage is 25 mg QID.

* **Minimizing TCA/Phenothiazine Side Effects - Off-Label (Oral):** 25 mg TID or QID is often used off-label.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Dosage for children and adolescents varies depending on the condition and route of administration.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions.

* **Urinary Retention (Oral):**  0.3-0.6 mg/kg/day divided into three to four doses. The maximum single dose for children is 10 mg.

* **Urinary Retention (Subcutaneous Injection):** 0.12-0.2 mg/kg/day, given three to four times daily.

* **GERD - Off-Label (Oral):** 0.1-0.2 mg/kg per dose, four times daily, taken 30-60 minutes before meals and at bedtime.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  A doctor should always be consulted to determine appropriate dosage in these situations.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal cramps
* Diarrhea
* Increased salivation
* Flushing
* Sweating (Diaphoresis)
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Urinary urgency
* Bronchospasm (in individuals with asthma or similar conditions)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include seizures, and worsening of asthma or other respiratory conditions.  If any concerning side effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Bethanechol is a parasympathomimetic agent, meaning it mimics the actions of the parasympathetic nervous system.  It works by directly stimulating muscarinic receptors in the bladder, causing increased bladder muscle tone and contractions, which facilitates urination. Similarly, it affects the gastrointestinal tract, promoting increased tone and peristalsis.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Bethanechol is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components; mechanical obstructions of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts; conditions where increased muscle activity in these tracts could be harmful (e.g., post-surgery); hyperthyroidism; peptic ulcer disease; active or latent asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease; pronounced bradycardia or hypotension; vasomotor instability; coronary artery disease; epilepsy; bladder neck obstruction; spastic gastrointestinal disturbances; acute inflammatory lesions of the gastrointestinal tract; marked vagotonia; peritonitis; and Parkinsonism.

* **Interactions:**  Bethanechol's effects can be enhanced by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and beta-blockers.  Concurrent use requires careful monitoring.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Bethanechol is categorized as pregnancy category C.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown.  Healthcare professionals should carefully weigh the benefits and risks before prescribing it to pregnant or breastfeeding women.

* **Other Precautions:**  Patients should be advised to rise slowly to minimize dizziness and to avoid hazardous activities after taking Bethanechol. Abrupt withdrawal should be avoided.
