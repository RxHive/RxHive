# Belzutifan
### Generic Name
Belzutifan

### Usage

Belzutifan is a medication used to treat adults with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease.  Specifically, it's indicated for patients who need treatment for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) associated with VHL disease and where immediate surgery isn't necessary.  Belzutifan targets the underlying genetic abnormality in VHL disease, offering a systemic approach to managing multiple tumor types arising from this condition.  It's important to note that Belzutifan doesn't cure VHL disease but helps control tumor growth and associated symptoms.


### Dosage

The standard adult dose of Belzutifan is 120 mg taken orally once daily.  This dosage continues until the disease progresses, or until intolerable side effects occur.  

**Important Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For patients with mild hepatic impairment (slightly elevated liver enzymes), no dosage adjustment is typically needed.  However, there's no specific guidance from the manufacturer for moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  Close monitoring by a healthcare professional is crucial.

* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher, no dosage adjustment is necessary.  Again, guidance for lower eGFR levels is not provided by the manufacturer, necessitating careful monitoring.


* **Adverse Reaction Management:**  Dose reduction is recommended for certain side effects. A first dose reduction might involve lowering the dose to 80mg daily, a second reduction to 40mg daily, and a third would require discontinuation of the medication. Specific guidelines exist for managing anemia and hypoxia, both requiring dose adjustments or cessation of treatment based on severity.


There is no established dosage for children.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Abdominal pain
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Increased blood glucose levels
* Weight gain
* Anemia (including severe anemia)
* Leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count)
* Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Visual impairment
* Increased creatinine levels (kidney function indicator)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Hypoxia (low blood oxygen)
* Upper respiratory tract infections


Less common, but serious side effects include:  Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), retinal detachment, central retinal vein occlusion, and dehydration.  

**Important:** If you experience any concerning side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Belzutifan is a hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2α) inhibitor.  HIF-2α is a protein that plays a key role in the development of tumors associated with VHL disease.  In individuals with VHL disease, HIF-2α is abnormally active, promoting tumor growth. Belzutifan works by binding to HIF-2α, blocking its activity and thus hindering tumor growth and angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels that feed tumors).


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Belzutifan can cause harm to a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age must use effective non-hormonal birth control during treatment and for at least one week after the last dose.  Belzutifan may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.

* **Breastfeeding:**  It's unknown whether Belzutifan passes into breast milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for one week after the final dose.

* **Drug Interactions:** Belzutifan can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Specific interactions are noted with certain enzyme inhibitors and substrates.


* **Other precautions:**  Monitor liver and kidney function regularly while on Belzutifan.  Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and oxygen saturation is necessary to detect anemia and hypoxia early.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Belzutifan with food?** A: Yes, Belzutifan can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day. Do not take an extra dose to make up for the missed one. Resume your regular schedule the following day.

* **Q: How should I store Belzutifan?** A: Store Belzutifan as directed on the product label.

* **Q: Are there long-term effects of Belzutifan?** A: Long-term effects are not fully known, but ongoing monitoring is vital for detection of any potential long-term complications.  Discuss concerns with your healthcare provider.

* **Q: Can Belzutifan cure VHL disease?** A: No, Belzutifan does not cure VHL disease; it manages the tumor growth associated with the condition.
