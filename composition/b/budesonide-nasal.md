# Budesonide (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Budesonide (Nasal)

### Usage
Budesonide nasal spray is a corticosteroid medication primarily used to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in adults and children aged 6 years and older.  This includes both seasonal allergic rhinitis (triggered by pollen, etc.) and perennial allergic rhinitis (year-round allergies). It effectively relieves symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, and nasal congestion.  

Beyond allergic rhinitis, budesonide nasal spray is also used to treat nasal polyps, and to help prevent the recurrence of nasal polyps after surgery to remove them (polypectomy).


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation of budesonide nasal spray (different strengths are available), the condition being treated, and the patient's age.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions carefully.  The following information is for general guidance only and should not replace professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Allergic Rhinitis:** Dosages range from one to four sprays per nostril once or twice daily, depending on the severity of symptoms and the specific budesonide product.  The doctor will determine the appropriate starting dose and may adjust it as needed.  Maximum doses can be substantially higher.
* **Nasal Polyps:**  Typically, one to two sprays per nostril twice daily. Again, the specific dosage will be determined by your healthcare provider.

**Children (6 years and older):**

* **Allergic Rhinitis:** Dosages are generally lower than for adults and start with one spray per nostril once daily, potentially increasing to two sprays per nostril once daily if needed.  Close monitoring is necessary, and the maximum daily dose should be strictly adhered to.  Long-term use in children may require monitoring of growth.
* **Nasal Polyps:**  Dosage will be prescribed by the physician and depends on the child's age and condition.


**Important Administration Notes:**

* Always shake the nasal spray bottle gently before use.  
* Follow the instructions provided with your specific medication for priming the spray (initial activations to ensure proper delivery).  
* Clear your nasal passages before each use.
* Gently tilt your head back slightly when spraying.
* Hold the spray bottle upright and spray into each nostril.

### How it Works

Budesonide is a corticosteroid.  Corticosteroids reduce inflammation by influencing various cells and chemicals involved in the inflammatory response. In allergic rhinitis, it suppresses the activity of cells that release inflammatory substances like histamine, thereby reducing symptoms.  In nasal polyps, it reduces the inflammation and swelling that contribute to polyp formation.  The effect is primarily local within the nasal passages, resulting in limited systemic absorption.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Budesonide nasal spray should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to budesonide or any of its ingredients.
* **Infections:**  Avoid using budesonide if you have an active infection in your nose or sinuses, particularly untreated bacterial, fungal, or viral infections.  
* **Tuberculosis:** Budesonide is contraindicated in patients with active or latent tuberculosis.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, consult your doctor to weigh the benefits and risks before using it.
* **Children:**  Use in children under 6 years of age is generally not recommended unless specifically prescribed by a physician and carefully monitored.
* **Drug Interactions:** Some medications can interact with budesonide, so inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.  Specifically, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase budesonide blood levels.
* **Long-Term Use:** Long-term use may increase the risk of certain side effects, particularly in children (e.g., growth retardation) and may require monitoring of the adrenal gland function (HPA axis suppression).
