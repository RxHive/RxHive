# Buformin
### Generic Name
Buformin

### Usage
Buformin is an oral antidiabetic medication belonging to the biguanide class.  Its primary use is in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It works by improving the body's sensitivity to insulin and decreasing the liver's production of glucose.  While it was used in the past, it's important to note that buformin has been withdrawn from the market in many countries due to concerns about a higher-than-acceptable risk of lactic acidosis (a serious build-up of lactic acid in the blood).  Therefore, it is rarely prescribed today.


### Dosage
Because buformin is largely unavailable due to safety concerns, providing specific dosage information would be irresponsible.  If you are considering buformin, or any medication for diabetes, it is crucial to only consult a healthcare professional for proper guidance and dosage determination.  They can assess your individual health status and determine the safest and most effective treatment plan.  Dosage would have varied depending on the individual's condition, other medications they were taking, and their response to the drug.


### Side Effects
While the precise frequency of side effects for buformin is limited due to its withdrawal from the market, some commonly reported side effects included:

* Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain)
* Metallic taste in the mouth
* Weakness
* Lactic acidosis (a serious but rare side effect characterized by fatigue, muscle pain, and shortness of breath; this is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention)

**Important Note:** This list is not exhaustive.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported immediately to a doctor.


### How it Works
Buformin works through several mechanisms to help control blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.  It primarily reduces glucose production in the liver and improves how the body's cells utilize glucose.  Additionally, it can decrease glucose absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.  These actions contribute to lower fasting and post-meal blood sugar levels.


### Precautions
Due to the significant risk of lactic acidosis, buformin is generally not prescribed.  The risk of lactic acidosis is increased in individuals with:

* Kidney disease
* Liver disease
* Heart failure
* Severe infections
* Dehydration
* Alcohol abuse
* Any condition that can impair oxygen delivery to tissues

Buformin should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Interactions with other medications are possible, so it's critical to inform any healthcare provider of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal supplements) being taken.  This includes any potential interactions with metformin, another biguanide, given their similar mechanisms of action and potential for overlapping side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is buformin still available?**  A: Buformin is not widely available in many countries due to safety concerns regarding lactic acidosis.

* **Q: What are the alternatives to buformin?** A: Several other medications are used to treat type 2 diabetes, such as metformin, sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists. A doctor can help determine the most appropriate alternative based on individual needs.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Immediately contact a healthcare professional if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, especially symptoms suggestive of lactic acidosis (fatigue, muscle pain, shortness of breath).

* **Q: How should I store buformin?** A:  Since buformin is largely unavailable, storage instructions are not relevant.  However, for any diabetes medication, always follow the storage guidelines provided by your physician or pharmacist.
