# Bezlotoxumab
### Generic Name
Bezlotoxumab

### Usage
Bezlotoxumab is a medication used to prevent the recurrence of *Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDI) in adults (18 years and older).  It's crucial to understand that Bezlotoxumab is *not* a treatment for CDI itself; it's given alongside antibiotics that are actively fighting the infection.  It's reserved for patients at high risk of experiencing a repeat CDI episode. This high-risk group typically includes individuals aged 65 or older who have had a second CDI episode within the past six months, those who are immunocompromised, or those who experienced severe CDI (defined by a high white blood cell count or elevated creatinine levels).  Bezlotoxumab works by targeting and neutralizing *C. difficile* toxin B, a major contributor to the severity and recurrence of CDI.  It does not affect toxin A.

### Dosage
Bezlotoxumab is administered intravenously (IV) as a single 10 mg/kg dose during the course of antibiotic treatment for CDI.  The safety and efficacy of repeat doses haven't been established.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment aren't specified in the manufacturer's labeling, as studies haven't shown clinically significant differences in drug exposure between individuals with these conditions and those with normal liver and kidney function.  The medication is not approved for use in children under 18.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include cardiac failure.

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include headache, nausea, fever, and infusion-related reactions (such as nausea, fatigue, fever, dizziness, headache, shortness of breath, and high blood pressure).

Rare, but serious side effects, including ventricular tachyarrhythmia (a rapid heart rhythm), have been reported in post-marketing surveillance.  Any concerning side effect warrants immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Bezlotoxumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody. This means it's a laboratory-made protein designed to mimic the body's natural immune response.  Specifically, it binds to and neutralizes *C. difficile* toxin B. By preventing this toxin from damaging the intestinal lining, it reduces the likelihood of the infection returning.  It's important to remember that Bezlotoxumab only targets toxin B; it doesn't affect toxin A, another toxin produced by *C. difficile*.

### Precautions
While no specific contraindications are listed, Bezlotoxumab should be used cautiously in patients with a history of heart failure.  The benefits must be carefully weighed against the potential risks in such cases. There's a reported interaction with belimumab;  avoid combining these medications.  Information regarding Bezlotoxumab's use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is limited.  Potential placental transfer is possible, and excretion in breast milk is unknown. Healthcare providers should consider these factors when prescribing Bezlotoxumab to pregnant or breastfeeding individuals.
