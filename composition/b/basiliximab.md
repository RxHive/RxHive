# Basiliximab
### Generic Name
Basiliximab

### Usage
Basiliximab is a monoclonal antibody primarily used to prevent acute organ rejection in kidney transplant recipients.  It's administered intravenously (IV) in combination with other immunosuppressant drugs like cyclosporine and corticosteroids.  While its primary use is in kidney transplantation, basiliximab is also used off-label in other organ transplants, such as heart and liver transplants, to help prevent rejection.  Additionally, it has seen off-label use in treating refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), a serious complication that can occur after stem cell transplantation.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Kidney Transplant Rejection Prophylaxis:** A 20 mg IV dose is given within 2 hours before the transplant surgery, followed by a second 20 mg dose 4 days post-transplant. The second dose is withheld if complications arise after the first dose, such as severe hypersensitivity or graft loss.
* **Heart Transplant Rejection Prophylaxis (Off-Label):**  A similar two-dose regimen of 20 mg IV is typically used, with the first dose given on the day of transplant (immediately before or within the first few hours after) and the second dose 4 days later.
* **Liver Transplant Rejection Prophylaxis (Off-Label):**  The dosage mirrors that of heart transplant prophylaxis—a 20 mg IV dose on the day of transplant and another 20 mg IV dose 4 days later.
* **Refractory Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGVHD) (Off-Label):**  A 20 mg IV dose is given on days 1 and 4.  The dose may be repeated if aGVHD recurs.  Administration should occur over 30 minutes.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

For kidney transplant rejection prophylaxis in children and adolescents, the dose is weight-based:

* **Under 35 kg:** 10 mg IV before transplant and 10 mg IV four days post-transplant.
* **35 kg or over:** 20 mg IV before transplant and 20 mg IV four days post-transplant.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are specified in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  Headache, insomnia, pain, hypertension, peripheral edema, dyspnea, upper respiratory infection, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, acne, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and anemia.

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  Anaphylaxis, severe hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, cardiac failure, and pulmonary edema), cytokine release syndrome, new-onset diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, lymphoproliferative disorders, opportunistic infections.


**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Basiliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets the alpha chain of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor. This receptor is found on activated T-lymphocytes, which are key players in the immune response responsible for organ rejection. By blocking this receptor, basiliximab prevents the activation of these T-cells, thereby suppressing the immune system's attack on the transplanted organ.  This reduces the risk of organ rejection.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Basiliximab is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.  Careful monitoring is crucial during administration, as severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur.
* **Infections:**  Because basiliximab suppresses the immune system, patients are at increased risk of infections.  Careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection is essential.  Avoid live vaccines during and for a period after treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Basiliximab is a Category B drug during pregnancy.  Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception before, during, and for four months after treatment. The excretion of basiliximab in breast milk is unknown.
* **Re-exposure:** Extreme caution should be exercised when administering subsequent courses of Basiliximab to patients who have received it previously.
* **Other immunosuppressants:** Basiliximab is used in conjunction with other immunosuppressive agents.  The combined effects of these drugs should be considered.
* **Experienced Physician:** Basiliximab should only be prescribed and administered by physicians experienced in managing organ transplant patients and immunosuppression therapy.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is basiliximab administered?** A: Basiliximab is given intravenously (IV) as a bolus or infusion.
* **Q: How long does basiliximab treatment last?** A: Typically, basiliximab is given as two doses before and after transplant surgery.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately to discuss rescheduling or alternative management.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking basiliximab?** A: It’s generally recommended to avoid alcohol while on immunosuppressants.
* **Q: How should I store basiliximab?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of basiliximab?** A: Long-term effects can vary and are best discussed with your doctor.  Continued monitoring for infections and other complications is necessary.
