# Basiliximab

**Generic Name:** Basiliximab

**Usage:**

Basiliximab is a monoclonal antibody used to prevent organ rejection in kidney transplant recipients.  It's administered intravenously, usually within 2 hours before transplantation and then again 4 days post-transplant.  It's not used for other types of organ transplants.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can range from mild to severe. Common side effects include:

* **Infections:** Increased susceptibility to infections is a significant risk, including serious ones like pneumonia or sepsis.
* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  May require medication adjustments.
* **Fluid retention (edema):** Swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet.
* **Headache:**  Often mild and manageable.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Usually mild and temporary.
* **Allergic reactions:** These can range from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction).  This is a crucial reason for close post-administration monitoring.
* **Tremor:** Shaking or trembling.


**Less common but more serious side effects include:**

* **Kidney problems:** Worsening of kidney function.
* **Heart problems:**  Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).
* **Neurological problems:**  Including seizures in rare instances.


**How it Works:**

Basiliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) on the surface of activated T lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).  These T cells are crucial in the immune response that leads to organ rejection.  By binding to the IL-2R, basiliximab blocks the signal that activates these T cells, thus suppressing the immune response and reducing the risk of organ rejection.  Essentially, it helps prevent the body from attacking the newly transplanted kidney.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long do I need to take basiliximab?**  A: Basiliximab is typically given only as two doses around the time of transplantation. It's not a long-term immunosuppressant.  Other immunosuppressant drugs are required for ongoing rejection prevention.

* **Q: Can I take other medications with basiliximab?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions may occur.  Basiliximab is frequently used alongside other immunosuppressants.

* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe allergic reactions (difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue), severe infections, significant changes in kidney function, or chest pain.

* **Q: Is basiliximab safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  The safety of basiliximab during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your doctor to discuss the risks and benefits.

* **Q:  Is basiliximab a cure for kidney failure?** A: No, basiliximab is an immunosuppressant used to prevent organ rejection; it doesn't treat the underlying kidney disease that led to the need for a transplant.
