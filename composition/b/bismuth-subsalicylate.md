# Bismuth Subsalicylate
### Generic Name
Bismuth Subsalicylate

### Usage

Bismuth subsalicylate is primarily used to treat diarrhea, including traveler's diarrhea. It's also sometimes used to alleviate symptoms of dyspepsia (indigestion).  While not its primary indication, it plays a role in some regimens to eradicate *Helicobacter pylori*, a bacterium responsible for stomach ulcers.  It's important to note that the use of bismuth subsalicylate for *H. pylori* eradication and as a prophylactic against traveler's diarrhea is considered off-label.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Diarrhea/Dyspepsia:** The typical adult dose is 524 mg every 30-60 minutes, or 1050 mg every 60 minutes, as needed, for up to two days.  The maximum daily dose is 4200 mg.
* **Traveler's Diarrhea (Treatment):**  Similar to diarrhea/dyspepsia treatment, 524 mg every 30-60 minutes, or 1050 mg every 60 minutes, as needed. The maximum daily dose remains 4200 mg.
* **Traveler's Diarrhea (Prophylaxis - Off-label):**  524 mg four times daily (QID) with meals and at bedtime during the period of risk.  Use should not exceed three weeks.
* ***Helicobacter pylori* Eradication (Off-label):**  As part of quadruple therapy, 300 mg QID in combination with other antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor for 10-14 days.  This dosage and regimen must be prescribed by a physician.


**Children:**

Dosage for children varies significantly depending on age and formulation (regular strength vs. extra strength).  Always follow the specific instructions provided by the child's doctor and the medication labeling.  The information below is for guidance only and should not replace professional advice. For children under 12, consult a physician before administering this medication.  

* **Children ≥ 12 years:**  Dosages are similar to adults, but the maximum daily dose should be carefully monitored.

* **Children < 12 years:** Dosage varies greatly with age and weight and needs to be determined by a healthcare professional.


**Administration:**  Liquid formulations should be shaken well before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed thoroughly; non-chewable tablets should be swallowed whole with water.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Darkening of the stool (grayish-black) and tongue. These are generally harmless and resolve once the medication is stopped.

* **Less Common, but Potentially Serious:**  These include neurological effects (anxiety, confusion, depression, headache, slurred speech); gastrointestinal issues (beyond stool and tongue discoloration); muscle spasms or weakness; and hearing problems (tinnitus, hearing loss).


**If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Bismuth subsalicylate's mechanism of action in treating diarrhea isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work through several pathways.  It may bind to toxins in the intestines, helping to prevent their absorption. It can also reduce intestinal inflammation and slow down bowel movements, allowing the body more time to absorb fluids and electrolytes.  The salicylate component may also have an anti-inflammatory effect.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Bismuth subsalicylate is contraindicated in individuals with known allergies to bismuth, aspirin, or other salicylates; those with active GI bleeding or ulcers; those with certain bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand disease, hemophilia); children recovering from or with chickenpox or influenza (risk of Reye's syndrome).

* **Interactions:**  Bismuth subsalicylate can interact with several medications, including carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, methotrexate, and some NSAIDs.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Bismuth can interfere with some gastrointestinal imaging procedures.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Bismuth subsalicylate should generally be avoided during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.  Its use during breastfeeding requires careful consideration and consultation with a healthcare provider due to the salicylate component.
