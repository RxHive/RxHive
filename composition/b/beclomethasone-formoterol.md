# Beclomethasone + Formoterol
### Generic Name
Beclomethasone + Formoterol

### Usage

This combination medication is used for the long-term maintenance treatment of asthma.  It's particularly beneficial for individuals whose asthma isn't adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids alone or those requiring frequent use of a separate, fast-acting rescue inhaler.  The Beclomethasone component, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation in the airways, while Formoterol, a long-acting beta-2 agonist, helps relax the muscles surrounding the airways, improving airflow.

This combination is also used in patients with severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) who experience frequent exacerbations (worsening of symptoms) despite treatment with other long-acting bronchodilators.  It's important to note that this combination is *not* intended for the immediate relief of acute asthma attacks or sudden shortness of breath.  A separate, rapid-acting bronchodilator should be used for such emergencies.


### Dosage

**Important Note:** The information below is for general knowledge and should not replace guidance from a healthcare professional.  Dosage should be tailored to individual needs and medical history.

**Adults:**

* **Asthma (Maintenance Therapy):**  Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (e.g., Beclomethasone 100 mcg/Formoterol 6 mcg or 200 mcg/6 mcg).  Your doctor will prescribe the appropriate dose, typically ranging from 1-2 inhalations twice daily (BID) up to a maximum of 4 inhalations per day. A separate, rapid-acting bronchodilator should be used for acute symptoms.

* **Asthma (Maintenance and Reliever Therapy):**  Again, dosage depends on the formulation. The regimen might involve 1 inhalation BID for maintenance, with additional inhalations as needed for symptom relief. The maximum daily dose is usually 8 inhalations.

* **COPD:** The typical dosage is 2 inhalations BID using a formulation containing Beclomethasone 100 mcg/Formoterol 6 mcg.


**Children and Adolescents:** The safety and efficacy of this combination in individuals under 18 years of age have not been established.


**Administration:** The medication is administered via inhalation using either a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or a dry powder inhaler (DPI).  Always follow the instructions provided with your specific inhaler carefully.  Rinsing the mouth with water after each use is recommended to minimize the risk of oral thrush (candidiasis).


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are routinely recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, but individual assessment by a healthcare provider is vital.



### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Voice changes (hoarseness)
* Sore throat (pharyngitis)
* Oral thrush (candidiasis)

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (Frequency not always defined or less than 1%):**

* Behavioral changes (especially in children), anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances,  aggressiveness
* Adrenal suppression
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Heart problems (irregular heartbeat, increased heart rate, chest pain)
* Low potassium levels
* Increased blood sugar
* Vision problems (blurred vision, cataracts, glaucoma)
* Bone thinning (osteoporosis)
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing)

If you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Beclomethasone, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation in the airways by suppressing the activity of immune cells that contribute to airway swelling and narrowing.  This helps to prevent asthma attacks and COPD exacerbations.

Formoterol, a long-acting beta-2 agonist, works by relaxing the muscles surrounding the airways, making breathing easier.  Its long duration of action ensures sustained relief.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to beclomethasone, formoterol, or any of the inhaler's components.

* **Interactions:**  This combination can interact with certain medications, particularly those that can prolong the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), affect potassium levels, or interact with beta-adrenergic drugs. Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your doctor before starting this treatment.

* **Warnings:**  This combination should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (such as heart failure or high blood pressure), diabetes, low potassium levels, glaucoma, cataracts, osteoporosis, or those at increased risk of pneumonia.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a doctor before starting this medication, as the effects on the fetus and infant are not fully known.  Close monitoring is essential for patients with existing conditions. Regular monitoring of lung function, blood glucose, and potassium levels might be recommended.

* **Special Populations:**  Use in children and adolescents is not recommended due to a lack of established safety and efficacy. Elderly patients might require careful monitoring due to an increased risk of side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use this inhaler for immediate relief of an asthma attack?** A: No. This medication is for long-term control, not acute relief. Use a separate, fast-acting bronchodilator for sudden breathing problems.

* **Q: How should I store my inhaler?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and excessive heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
