# Beclometasone + Salicylic Acid
### Generic Name
Beclometasone + Salicylic Acid

### Usage
Beclometasone dipropionate and salicylic acid combination is a topical corticosteroid and keratolytic medication primarily used to treat inflammatory skin conditions, especially those involving scaling and thickening of the skin.  Its primary use is in the management of psoriasis and eczema (atopic dermatitis), particularly when these conditions are accompanied by plaques or scaling.  It can also be used to treat other inflammatory dermatoses responding well to topical corticosteroids with the added benefit of salicylic acid's keratolytic action.  This combination therapy works synergistically; the beclometasone reduces inflammation and itching, while the salicylic acid helps soften and remove scales, improving penetration of the corticosteroid and overall treatment efficacy.  It's important to note that this combination is for topical use only and should not be ingested.

### Dosage
Dosage depends on the specific formulation (cream, ointment, lotion), the affected area, and the severity of the condition.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage and frequency of application.  Generally, a thin film is applied to the affected area once or twice daily, as directed by a physician.  Specific instructions will be provided on the medication label. There are no established pediatric or adult IV formulations of this combination drug.  Always follow your doctor's instructions and never exceed the recommended dosage.   Children should only use this medication under strict medical supervision due to the risk of corticosteroid absorption through the skin.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site. These may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Skin dryness
* Itching
* Redness
* Thinning of the skin (with prolonged use)
* Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles)
* Skin atrophy (thinning and loss of elasticity)

Less common but more serious side effects, while rare with topical application, can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)
* Skin infections
*  Increased susceptibility to skin infections
* Cushingâ€™s syndrome (with prolonged or extensive use, especially in children)  


If any adverse effects occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Beclometasone dipropionate is a potent corticosteroid that reduces inflammation by binding to intracellular receptors, suppressing the production of inflammatory mediators.  This leads to decreased redness, swelling, itching, and scaling. Salicylic acid is a keratolytic agent, meaning it helps soften and remove the thickened, scaly skin.  By removing the scale, salicylic acid improves the penetration of the beclometasone, allowing it to work more effectively. The combined action of these two ingredients makes the treatment more effective than using either one alone for conditions characterized by inflammation and scaling.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to beclometasone dipropionate, salicylic acid, or any other components of the formulation.  It should be avoided on infected skin.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Limited data exists on significant interactions with other medications when used topically. However, inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, you are using.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Children:** Use in children requires careful monitoring due to increased risk of systemic absorption and potential side effects like adrenal suppression.
* **Elderly:**  Elderly individuals may have thinner skin, potentially increasing the risk of side effects.  Close monitoring is recommended.
* **Extensive or Prolonged Use:** Avoid prolonged or widespread application to prevent systemic absorption and potential side effects.  Always apply a thin layer only to the affected area.
