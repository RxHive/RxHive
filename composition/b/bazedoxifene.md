# Bazedoxifene
### Generic Name
Bazedoxifene

### Usage

Bazedoxifene is primarily used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis in women who have a high risk of fractures.  It's a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), meaning it acts like estrogen in some parts of the body and blocks estrogen in others.  This targeted action helps to increase bone density and reduce the risk of fractures, a common complication of osteoporosis. Bazedoxifene is *not* indicated for use in premenopausal women or for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer.


### Dosage

**Adults (Postmenopausal Women):** The standard dosage is one 20 mg tablet taken orally once daily.  It can be taken with or without food.

**Children:** Bazedoxifene is not approved for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Bazedoxifene is not recommended for individuals with hepatic impairment (liver problems).
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for those with mild to moderate renal impairment (kidney problems).  However, caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment, and a doctor's careful evaluation is necessary.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Hot flashes
* Leg cramps and muscle cramps


**Less Common but Notable Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin rash and hives (urticaria)
* Increased triglyceride levels
* Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT and AST)
* Hypersensitivity reactions


**Rare but Serious Side Effects (Less than 1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Venous thromboembolism (blood clots in veins, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism)
* Retinal thrombosis (blood clots in the eye)
* Various eye-related problems (blepharospasm, blurred vision, etc.)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Bazedoxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).  It acts differently depending on the tissue. In bone, it acts as an agonist (mimicking estrogen's effects), reducing bone breakdown and increasing bone density. Conversely, in the uterus and breast tissue, it acts as an antagonist (blocking estrogen), reducing the risk of endometrial hyperplasia (thickening of the uterine lining) and potentially reducing the risk of certain cancers.


### Precautions

**Contraindications (Bazedoxifene should NOT be used in these cases):**

* Allergy to bazedoxifene or any of its ingredients.
* Unexplained uterine bleeding.
* Signs or symptoms of endometrial cancer.
* Active or history of venous thromboembolic events (blood clots).
* Pregnancy or possibility of pregnancy (Bazedoxifene is only for postmenopausal women).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Bazedoxifene may increase the risk of blood clots, so it should be used cautiously in patients with risk factors for blood clots.
* Patients with hypertriglyceridemia (high levels of triglycerides) should be carefully monitored.
* Use with caution in patients with severe kidney problems.
* Regular monitoring of lipid profiles (blood fats) may be recommended.

**Drug Interactions:**  Bazedoxifene's effects can be altered by certain medications, particularly those that induce liver enzymes (like carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin).  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking to avoid potential interactions.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Bazedoxifene with food?** A: You can take it with or without food.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The full benefits of Bazedoxifene on bone density may not be seen for several months. Regular monitoring is essential.

* **Q: How should I store Bazedoxifene?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking Bazedoxifene suddenly?** A: No. Always consult your doctor before stopping treatment.  Stopping abruptly may not be advisable.
