# Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ephedrine + Guaifenesin

This combination of Bromhexine, Chlorpheniramine Maleate, Ephedrine, and Guaifenesin is not a standard, pre-approved fixed-dose combination in most countries.  Pharmacies may compound such a combination based on a doctor's prescription, but it's crucial to understand that the safety and efficacy of this specific combination haven't been extensively studied in clinical trials as a single product.  The information below reflects the individual actions of each drug. Using this combination requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional.

**Generic Name:** Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ephedrine + Guaifenesin (Note: This is not an officially recognized single drug name)

**Usage:** This combination is *potentially* used to treat symptoms of the common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections.  Each ingredient targets different aspects:

* **Bromhexine:**  A mucolytic agent that thins and loosens mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that reduces allergy symptoms like runny nose and sneezing.
* **Ephedrine:** A sympathomimetic decongestant that shrinks swollen nasal membranes, relieving stuffiness.  Note: Ephedrine's use is increasingly restricted due to potential side effects and abuse potential.
* **Guaifenesin:** An expectorant that helps thin and loosen mucus.

**Side Effects:** The side effects listed below are potential side effects of *each individual drug*. The combination may result in more or less pronounced effects and could even lead to drug interactions.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist.

* **Bromhexine:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, skin rash.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision.
* **Ephedrine:** Increased heart rate, high blood pressure, anxiety, insomnia, nervousness, headache.
* **Guaifenesin:** Nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, headache.

**How it Works:**

* **Bromhexine:** Reduces the viscosity of mucus by altering the mucus glycoproteins.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks histamine receptors, reducing the effects of histamine release during allergic reactions.
* **Ephedrine:** Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal passages, causing vasoconstriction and reducing swelling.
* **Guaifenesin:** Increases respiratory tract fluid secretion, thinning the mucus and facilitating expectoration.
