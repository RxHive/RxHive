# Bictegravir + Emtricitabine + Tenofovir Alafenamide
### Generic Name
Bictegravir + Emtricitabine + Tenofovir Alafenamide

**Note:** This combination drug is often referred to by its brand name, Biktarvy.  This information applies to the generic form of the medication.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific information regarding your prescription.


### Usage

Bictegravir + Emtricitabine + Tenofovir Alafenamide is a fixed-dose combination medication used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (approximately 77 lbs). It's a complete regimen, meaning it contains all the necessary components to suppress the virus.  This combination targets different stages of the HIV lifecycle, making it highly effective at reducing the viral load and improving the CD4 cell count (a measure of immune function).  The primary use is as first-line treatment for HIV-1, meaning it's often the initial choice for patients starting antiretroviral therapy (ART).  It's also sometimes used in subsequent treatment lines if other regimens have failed or are no longer tolerated.  It is *not* a cure for HIV; consistent use is vital for controlling the virus and preventing progression to AIDS.


### Dosage

**Adults and Adolescents (â‰¥35 kg):**  The usual dose is one tablet taken orally once daily with food.  There are no specific dosage adjustments based on weight within this population, but it's crucial for individuals to take the medication exactly as prescribed.

**Children:** This combination is not approved for use in children under the age of 12 or weighing less than 35kg.  Separate medications for HIV treatment may be necessary for this population.


**IV Administration:** This medication is not available in an intravenous (IV) form. It is administered orally only.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Abnormal dreams
* Rash

Less common but serious side effects can include:

* Liver problems (elevated liver enzymes)
* Kidney problems (decreased kidney function)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Depression
* Anxiety


If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Bictegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). It works by blocking the HIV integrase enzyme, preventing the virus from integrating its genetic material into the DNA of human cells. This stops the virus from replicating.

Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). They interfere with reverse transcriptase, an enzyme HIV uses to convert its RNA into DNA.  By inhibiting this process, they prevent the virus from replicating.

The combination of these three drugs acts synergistically, targeting different stages of the viral life cycle and achieving potent suppression of HIV replication.



### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:** Individuals with a known allergy to any of the components of this medication should not take it.
* **Liver Disease:**  This medication should be used with caution in patients with existing liver problems. Liver function tests may be required before and during treatment.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Tenofovir alafenamide can affect kidney function.  Patients with pre-existing kidney disease require careful monitoring and may need dose adjustments or alternative therapies.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While generally safe during pregnancy, healthcare providers will carefully consider the benefits and risks.  This medication is generally not recommended for breastfeeding mothers, as it can be transmitted through breast milk.
* **Drug Interactions:** This medication can interact with other drugs.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Bone Health:** Some patients experience decreases in bone mineral density. Your doctor might recommend monitoring your bone health.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol use should be avoided as it can negatively impact liver function.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Is this medication a cure for HIV?** A: No, it is not a cure.  It suppresses the virus and helps to prevent progression to AIDS, but lifelong treatment is typically required.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of taking this medication?** A: Long-term effects vary, and regular monitoring by a healthcare provider is essential to detect and manage potential problems such as kidney or bone issues.
