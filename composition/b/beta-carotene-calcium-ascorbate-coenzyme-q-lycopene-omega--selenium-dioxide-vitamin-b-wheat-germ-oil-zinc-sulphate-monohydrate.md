### Generic Name
Multivitamin and Antioxidant Supplement (Beta Carotene + Calcium Ascorbate + Coenzyme Q10 + Lycopene + Omega-3 Fatty Acids + Selenium Dioxide + Vitamin B Complex + Wheat Germ Oil + Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate)


Note:  This is a combination product. There isn't one single "generic name" as it combines several active ingredients.  The above is a descriptive name reflecting the components.  Each individual component would have its own generic name (e.g., Beta Carotene, Calcium Ascorbate, etc.).


### Usage

This combination supplement provides a range of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants intended to support overall health and well-being.  It's not intended to treat or cure any specific disease, but rather to supplement dietary intake of these essential nutrients.  The individual components have various roles:

* **Beta-carotene:** A precursor to Vitamin A, important for vision, immune function, and cell growth.
* **Calcium ascorbate:** A form of Vitamin C, a potent antioxidant crucial for immune function, collagen synthesis, and iron absorption.
* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):** An antioxidant that plays a role in energy production within cells.  It's often used to support heart health.
* **Lycopene:** A carotenoid with antioxidant properties, associated with potential benefits for cardiovascular and prostate health.
* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Essential fatty acids with anti-inflammatory properties, important for heart health, brain function, and reducing the risk of certain diseases.
* **Selenium Dioxide:** A trace mineral with antioxidant properties, supporting thyroid function and immune system health.
* **Vitamin B Complex:** A group of B vitamins crucial for energy metabolism, nerve function, and red blood cell formation.
* **Wheat Germ Oil:**  A source of Vitamin E and other antioxidants, potentially beneficial for skin health.
* **Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate:** A form of Zinc, an essential mineral involved in immune function, wound healing, and cell growth.


This supplement is often used by individuals seeking to improve their antioxidant intake, support their immune system, or address potential nutrient deficiencies in their diet.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using this or any supplement, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation of the supplement.  The product label will specify the amount of each ingredient per serving, and the recommended daily intake.  There is no standard dosage across all products containing these ingredients.  **Always follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.**  It is crucial to avoid exceeding the recommended dosage.  This supplement is generally taken orally. IV administration is not applicable for this combination product.  Children's dosages would vary based on age and weight and should be determined by a pediatrician or healthcare provider.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (though infrequent and usually mild) can include:

* Upset stomach

* Allergic reactions (skin rash, itching)

Serious side effects are rare but can include:

* Liver damage (rare, primarily associated with high doses of certain vitamins)

### How it Works

This combination supplement works by providing the body with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These nutrients participate in a wide array of biochemical processes within the body. The antioxidants help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, while the vitamins and minerals support various bodily functions, contributing to overall health.  The mechanisms of action are specific to each individual component. For example, Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant, while Zinc is involved in enzyme function and immune response. Omega-3 fatty acids are incorporated into cell membranes and exert their effects through multiple pathways.
