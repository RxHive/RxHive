# Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Menthol

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or other upper respiratory tract infections.  It combines several active ingredients to address different aspects of these illnesses:

* **Bromhexine:**  A mucolytic agent that helps to thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that helps to relieve runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive) that reduces the urge to cough.
* **Menthol:** A topical analgesic that provides a cooling sensation and may help to relieve nasal congestion.


**Side Effects:**  The side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage.  Common side effects may include:

* **Drowsiness or sedation:** This is a common side effect of both chlorpheniramine and dextromethorphan.
* **Dry mouth:** A frequent side effect of antihistamines.
* **Constipation:**  Possibly caused by antihistamines.
* **Nausea or vomiting:** Though less common.
* **Headache:**  A possible side effect.
* **Dizziness:**  Especially with higher doses.
* **Irritability:** Particularly in children.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions, including skin rash, itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing, can occur.


**How it Works:**

The medication works through a combination of mechanisms:

* **Bromhexine:** Reduces the stickiness of mucus by breaking down the chemical bonds in the mucus. This makes it easier to expectorate (cough up) the phlegm.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction or infection. This reduces symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.  It's particularly effective for a dry, non-productive cough.
* **Menthol:** Creates a cooling sensation, providing temporary relief from nasal congestion and potentially soothing irritated throat tissues.  It works topically, rather than systemically like the other ingredients.
