# Bucillamine
### Generic Name
Bucillamine

### Usage
Bucillamine is primarily used to manage chronic rheumatoid arthritis.  It's classified as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).  While its main application is in rheumatoid arthritis,  it's crucial to understand that this medication should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician due to its potential side effects.  It's not a first-line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and is typically considered after other medications have been tried.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Rheumatoid Arthritis):**

* **Oral:** The initial dose is usually 100 mg three times a day (TID).  The doctor may adjust the dosage based on the patient's response and how well they tolerate the medication.  The usual maintenance dose ranges from 100-300 mg per day, with a maximum recommended dose of 300 mg per day.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Bucillamine is contraindicated in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with liver problems.  However, caution is advised, and careful monitoring is essential.
* **Renal Impairment:** Bucillamine is contraindicated in patients with kidney impairment.


### Side Effects
Bucillamine can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially more serious.  It's vital to report any concerning symptoms to your doctor immediately.

**Common Side Effects (Frequency 1-10% or more):** Increased serum bilirubin levels.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** The following side effects, while less frequent, can be severe.  Immediate medical attention is required if you experience any of these:

* **Nervous System:** Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, malaise, myasthenia (muscle weakness), numbness in fingers, severe myasthenia.
* **Cardiovascular:** Edema (swelling), hypersensitivity angiitis (inflammation of blood vessels), shock.
* **Dermatological:** Alopecia (hair loss), erythematous rash (red rash), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (severe skin reaction), toxic epidermal necrolysis (life-threatening skin reaction), yellow nail syndrome.
* **Endocrine & Metabolic:** Gynecomastia (breast enlargement in males).
* **Gastrointestinal:** Constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, dysgeusia (altered taste), nausea, stomach pain, vomiting, xerostomia (dry mouth).
* **Genitourinary:** Breast hypertrophy (breast enlargement), hematuria (blood in urine), proteinuria (protein in urine).
* **Hematologic:** Agranulocytosis (low white blood cell count), anemia, aplastic anemia (bone marrow failure), erythrocytopenia (low red blood cell count), pancytopenia (deficiency of all blood cell types).
* **Hepatic:** Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), increased levels of liver enzymes (ALP, ALT, AST).
* **Hypersensitivity:** Anaphylactoid reaction (severe allergic reaction), hypersensitivity reaction.
* **Neuromuscular & Skeletal:** Polymyositis (muscle inflammation).
* **Ophthalmic:** Blurred vision, eye pain.
* **Renal:** Acute renal failure, renal insufficiency.
* **Respiratory:** Eosinophilic pneumonitis (lung inflammation), flu-like symptoms, nonproductive cough, pleurisy (lung inflammation), respiratory distress.
* **Other:** Fever.


**Very Rare Side Effects (Less than 1%):**  Interstitial pneumonitis (lung inflammation), nephrotic syndrome (kidney damage), pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).  These are often reported post-marketing or based on case reports.


### How it Works
Bucillamine is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). Its active metabolites, SA679 and SA981, possess antioxidant properties and inhibit the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein involved in blood vessel formation and inflammation.  By reducing VEGF production, Bucillamine helps to control the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis.  The metabolite SA981 also displays immunosuppressive activity, further contributing to its therapeutic effect.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Bucillamine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, hematologic disorders, bone marrow suppression, renal impairment, and children.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients using Bucillamine have an increased risk of developing hematologic disorders (like aplastic anemia, bone marrow suppression, pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia) and renal effects (such as acute renal failure, renal impairment, nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, and hematuria).
* **Caution:**  Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, debilitated patients, those who have recently undergone surgery, and older adults.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Bucillamine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  It's generally recommended to avoid use during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, and to carefully weigh the risks and benefits if use is considered during breastfeeding.  Alternative medications may be preferable.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Bucillamine to work?** A: Bucillamine has a slow onset of action. It may take several months to see a noticeable improvement in symptoms. If thereâ€™s no improvement after 6 months, the treatment should be reviewed.
