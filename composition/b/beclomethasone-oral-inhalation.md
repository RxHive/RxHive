# Beclomethasone (Oral Inhalation)
### Generic Name
Beclomethasone (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage

Beclomethasone oral inhalation is a corticosteroid primarily used for long-term control of asthma in patients aged 5 years and older.  It's a preventative medication, meaning it helps prevent asthma attacks and reduces the frequency and severity of symptoms, but it does *not* provide immediate relief during an acute asthma episode (like an inhaler with albuterol).  Beclomethasone is also used off-label in the management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as part of a combination therapy.  It's crucial to remember that beclomethasone is not a rescue medication for sudden shortness of breath.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the patient's age, the severity of their asthma or COPD, and their previous treatment history.  There are significant differences in dosing recommendations from various sources (manufacturer's labeling, national guidelines, etc.). Always follow your doctor's prescription and instructions.  Here's a summary, but it shouldn't replace individualized guidance from a healthcare provider:

**Adults (Asthma):** Doses range from 80 mcg to 1000 mcg per day, administered in divided doses (e.g., twice daily).  The starting dose is usually lower and adjusted based on response.  Maximum doses are typically capped at 320 mcg to 400 mcg twice daily or even higher in certain cases, but this needs to be strictly determined by a doctor.  Different inhalers deliver varying amounts of beclomethasone per puff, adding to the complexity.

**Adults (COPD):** The dose for COPD is typically in a lower range, usually 50-400 mcg daily as part of a combination therapy, again based on the clinical judgment of the physician.

**Children (Asthma):** Dosing for children is significantly lower and varies greatly depending on age (typically starting at 40 mcg twice daily for younger children and increasing gradually) and asthma severity.  Again, these must be determined in coordination with a physician.


**Forms:** Beclomethasone for oral inhalation comes in various inhaler forms, including metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) with different strengths per actuation.  Always follow the specific instructions for your prescribed inhaler.

**Administration:**  Proper inhaler technique is crucial for effective delivery. Your doctor or pharmacist will provide specific instructions.  Many forms require "priming" the inhaler before the first use or after periods of non-use.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Oral thrush (candidiasis) – rinse your mouth with water after each use.
* Cough
* Hoarseness

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

*  Adrenal suppression (reduced cortisol production by the adrenal glands) – especially with high doses or prolonged use
*  Increased risk of infections
*  Osteoporosis (weakening of the bones), especially in long-term use, particularly pertinent to children and older adults.
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties) – a rare but serious reaction requiring immediate medical attention
* Vision changes (e.g., cataracts, glaucoma)
* Psychological effects (e.g., mood changes, depression, anxiety).
* Growth retardation in children


**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Beclomethasone is a corticosteroid, a type of anti-inflammatory medication. It works by reducing inflammation in the airways, making it easier to breathe.  The exact mechanisms are complex, but it involves reducing the activity of inflammatory cells and the release of inflammatory mediators in the lungs.  This helps to prevent the narrowing of the airways that occurs in asthma and COPD.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Do not use beclomethasone if you are allergic to it or any of its components.
* **Acute Asthma Attacks:** Beclomethasone is not for treating acute asthma attacks; use a fast-acting bronchodilator for that purpose.
* **Infections:** Beclomethasone may mask the symptoms of infections or worsen existing infections.
* **Other Medications:** Beclomethasone may interact with other medications. Inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Beclomethasone is a Category C pregnancy medication.  Consult with your doctor about the risks and benefits of using this medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Children:**  Close monitoring of growth is important in children using beclomethasone.
* **Bone Health:** Long-term use may increase the risk of osteoporosis. Discuss this with your physician, especially if you have risk factors for osteoporosis.
* **Glaucoma and Cataracts:** Beclomethasone can increase the risk of glaucoma or cataracts in some individuals. Eye exams may be recommended.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking beclomethasone suddenly?**  A: No.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a worsening of your condition.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.
* **Q: How should I store beclomethasone?** A: Store according to the instructions on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and extreme temperatures.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I use beclomethasone with other asthma medications?** A:  Yes, it's often used in combination with other medications, such as bronchodilators.  Your doctor will determine the best combination for you.
* **Q: Can I use beclomethasone if I have a cold or flu?** A: Consult your doctor.  It's generally safe to continue using beclomethasone for asthma/COPD management, but if you have a severe infection you may require alternative treatment.
