# Bicalutamide
### Generic Name
Bicalutamide

### Usage
Bicalutamide is primarily used in combination with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog to treat metastatic prostate cancer (stage D2).  This combination therapy works by blocking the effects of androgens, hormones that fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells.  While not officially approved for this use, bicalutamide is sometimes used as a monotherapy (alone) for locally advanced prostate cancer with a high risk of recurrence.  It's crucial to understand that bicalutamide should only be used under the strict guidance of a healthcare professional, and its use outside of approved indications carries potential risks.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** The standard dosage for metastatic prostate cancer is a 50mg tablet once daily, always taken in conjunction with an LHRH analog.  For off-label use in locally advanced prostate cancer, a higher dose of 150mg once daily may be prescribed, but this should only be considered under a doctor's supervision.  The medication is available as a tablet and should be taken at approximately the same time each day, regardless of food intake.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Bicalutamide is not approved for use in children due to safety and efficacy not being established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustment is usually needed for patients with renal impairment.  However, for those with hepatic (liver) impairment,  close monitoring is essential.  If the serum ALT level exceeds twice the upper limit of normal (ULN) or jaundice develops, the medication should be discontinued immediately.  Even in patients with mild to moderate liver problems at the start of treatment, caution is warranted as clearance may be delayed.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:**

* Pain
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Constipation, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* Hot flashes
* Gynecomastia (breast enlargement)
* Mastalgia (breast pain)
* Pelvic pain
* Anemia
* Back pain
* Weakness
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Infection

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage) –  This is a serious side effect that requires immediate medical attention.
* Hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, urticaria) – These allergic reactions can be life-threatening.
* Interstitial lung disease – This can cause significant breathing problems.
* QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm)
* Decreased glucose tolerance (worsening of diabetes)


Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor promptly.


### How it Works
Bicalutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen. This means it works by competitively blocking the binding of androgens (like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) to their receptors within prostate cancer cells. By preventing these hormones from binding, bicalutamide inhibits the growth and proliferation of prostate cancer cells.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Bicalutamide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or any of its components, women (including pregnant women), children, and patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing watchful waiting.

**Interactions:** Bicalutamide can interact with various medications.  Specifically, it may increase the risk of QT prolongation when co-administered with certain antiarrhythmics, methadone, some antipsychotics, or moxifloxacin.  It can also enhance the anticoagulant effects of warfarin.  Furthermore, it can interact with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes (like cimetidine and ketoconazole) leading to increased side effects.  Consult a doctor about all medications before taking bicalutamide.

**Warnings:**  Bicalutamide can cause gynecomastia, breast pain, anemia, and liver damage (hepatotoxicity).  It may also affect fertility in men and is categorized as pregnancy category X, meaning it's contraindicated in pregnant women.  Patients with hepatic impairment require close monitoring.
