# Beractant
### Generic Name
Beractant

### Usage
Beractant is a lung surfactant primarily used to prevent and treat Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in premature newborns.  RDS is a serious condition affecting the lungs of premature babies, causing breathing difficulties due to a lack of surfactantâ€”a substance that keeps air sacs in the lungs open.  Beractant is given to babies born weighing less than 1250 grams or showing signs of surfactant deficiency (prophylactic use, ideally within 15 minutes of birth). It's also used to treat RDS in newborns already showing signs of the condition, requiring mechanical ventilation (therapeutic use, within 8 hours of birth). Beractant is not indicated for use in adults.


### Dosage
Beractant is administered intravenously via the endotracheal tube.  Dosage is determined by the infant's weight and the reason for administration (prophylactic or therapeutic).

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Prophylactic Treatment (Prevention):** 4 mL/kg (100 mg phospholipids/kg) as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 15 minutes. Up to four doses may be given within the first 48 hours, at least 6 hours apart.  The need for additional doses depends on the baby's continued respiratory distress and oxygen requirements.

* **Therapeutic Treatment (Treatment):** 4 mL/kg (100 mg phospholipids/kg) as soon as RDS is diagnosed.  The dose may be repeated, but no more frequently than every 6 hours, with a maximum of four doses in the first 48 hours. Similar to prophylactic treatment, additional doses are determined based on ongoing respiratory distress and oxygen needs.

**Administration:** Beractant should be allowed to reach room temperature (20 minutes) before administration.  It should be gently swirled, not shaken, to mix if settling occurs. The dose is typically given in four 1 mL/kg aliquots, with each aliquot administered over 2-3 seconds, followed by at least 30 seconds of manual ventilation to allow for even distribution. The baby's position should be changed between each aliquot to facilitate even distribution.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10%): Transient bradycardia (slow heart rate).

Less common side effects (1-10%): Oxygen desaturation (low blood oxygen levels).

Rare side effects (<1%, post-marketing reports): Apnea (breathing pauses), emphysema (lung damage), hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide levels), hypertension (high blood pressure), hypotension (low blood pressure), increased susceptibility to infection, low blood carbon dioxide levels, endotracheal tube obstruction, pallor (paleness), pneumothorax (collapsed lung), and vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels).

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Beractant is a synthetic lung surfactant that mimics the natural surfactant produced by healthy lungs.  Surfactant reduces surface tension within the alveoli (tiny air sacs in the lungs), preventing them from collapsing during exhalation. This ensures that the lungs can efficiently exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide, improving breathing and oxygen levels in the baby.  In premature babies with RDS, surfactant is deficient or ineffective, leading to respiratory distress.  Beractant replaces this deficient surfactant, improving lung function.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling. However, careful consideration should be given to the risks versus benefits for extremely low birth weight infants.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Drugs that cause bradycardia (slow heart rate) may increase the risk of bradycardia when administered with Beractant.  Monitor the infant carefully for this side effect.  Bretylium is another drug known to interact negatively with Beractant.

* **Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of post-treatment nosocomial sepsis (hospital-acquired infection).  Transient episodes of bradycardia and decreased oxygen saturation can occur.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Beractant is not indicated for use in pregnant or breastfeeding women.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Beractant stored?** A:  Storage instructions should be followed as indicated on the product label.

* **Q: What should I do if my baby experiences bradycardia or decreased oxygen saturation?** A: Stop administration immediately and contact a healthcare professional for appropriate management.  These are serious side effects that require immediate attention.

* **Q: Is Beractant safe for all premature infants?** A: While Beractant is beneficial for many premature infants with RDS, its use in infants with extremely low birth weights (<600 grams) and those weighing more than 1750 grams requires careful consideration.

* **Q: How long does it take for Beractant to work?** A:  Beractant typically produces rapid improvements in lung oxygenation and compliance, often within minutes of administration.

* **Q:  What happens if my child shows signs of airway obstruction after administration?** A:  If there are signs of airway obstruction after administration, suctioning may be necessary.  If the obstruction is not removed, immediate replacement of the endotracheal tube may be required.
