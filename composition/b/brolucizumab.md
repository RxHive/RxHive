# Brolucizumab
### Generic Name
Brolucizumab

### Usage
Brolucizumab is a medication used to treat two serious eye conditions:

* **Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD):**  This is a condition where abnormal blood vessels grow behind the retina, leading to vision loss. Brolucizumab helps to slow or stop the growth of these vessels.

* **Diabetic macular edema (DME):** This is swelling in the macula (the central part of the retina) caused by diabetes.  Brolucizumab helps to reduce this swelling and improve vision.


### Dosage

Brolucizumab is administered as an intravitreal injection (directly into the eye) by a healthcare professional.  Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated:

**Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD):**

* The typical treatment begins with a 6 mg injection once a month for three months.  Following this initial phase, the frequency is reduced to an injection every 8-12 weeks (2-3 months), as determined by the ophthalmologist based on individual patient response.

**Diabetic macular edema (DME):**

* Treatment usually starts with a 6 mg injection every 6 weeks for 5 doses.  After this, the frequency is adjusted to an injection every 8-12 weeks (2-3 months), again based on the individual patient's response and physician's assessment.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of brolucizumab in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are needed for patients with liver or kidney problems.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:** The most common side effect is the development of antibodies against brolucizumab. Other side effects can include:


* Abnormal sensation in the eyes
* Blurred vision
* Eye pain
* Increased eye pressure
* Eye redness (conjunctival hyperemia)
* Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  While less frequent, some serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

*   Endophthalmitis (a serious eye infection)
*   Retinal detachment
*   Retinal vein occlusion
*   Arterial thromboembolic events (blood clots in arteries, such as stroke or heart attack)
*   Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)


If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Brolucizumab is a type of medication called a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor. VEGF is a protein that stimulates the growth of new blood vessels. In both wet AMD and DME, abnormal blood vessel growth contributes to vision loss. Brolucizumab works by binding to and blocking VEGF, thereby preventing the formation of these abnormal vessels and reducing swelling. This helps to preserve vision and, in some cases, even improve it.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Brolucizumab should not be used in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to the medication or any of its components, active ocular (eye) or periocular (around the eye) infections, or active intraocular inflammation.

* **Interactions:**  Currently, no clinically significant drug interactions with brolucizumab have been reported.  However, it's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Brolucizumab may harm a developing fetus.  Pregnant women, or those who could become pregnant, should use highly effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the final dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least one month after the final dose due to the potential for harm to the infant.

* **Increased Intraocular Pressure:**  Brolucizumab may increase intraocular pressure, so monitoring is crucial.

* **Other Risks:** There is an increased risk of endophthalmitis (serious eye infection), retinal detachment, retinal vasculitis/retinal vascular occlusion, and arterial thromboembolic events.



### FAQs

* **Q: How long does treatment with brolucizumab last?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the individual response and the treating ophthalmologist's assessment.  Treatment may continue for an extended period to maintain vision.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your ophthalmologist immediately to reschedule your injection. Do not attempt to adjust the dosage yourself.

* **Q: How is brolucizumab stored?** A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with your medication. Generally, it should be refrigerated.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of brolucizumab?** A: The long-term effects are not fully understood, but ongoing monitoring is essential. Discuss potential long-term risks with your doctor.

* **Q:  Can I drive after receiving an injection?** A: You may experience temporary visual disturbances. Do not drive or operate machinery until your vision has fully recovered.
