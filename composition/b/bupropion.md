# Bupropion
### Generic Name
Bupropion

### Usage
Bupropion is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) and seasonal affective disorder (SAD).  It's also a significant aid in smoking cessation.  Furthermore, it can be used off-label as an alternative treatment for individuals experiencing sexual dysfunction as a side effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants.  Other off-label uses include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar depression (as an adjunct to mood stabilizers).

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Bupropion is available as hydrochloride and hydrobromide salts.  These are not directly interchangeable;  dosage should be specified in the salt form prescribed.  Consult the specific product labeling for details on salt conversion.

Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific formulation (immediate-release, 12-hour extended-release, 24-hour extended-release), the condition being treated, and the patient's response and tolerability.  The information below is a summary and should not replace the guidance of a prescribing healthcare professional.  Always follow the physician's prescribed dosage instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Major Depressive Disorder:** Dosage typically starts low and is gradually increased.  Immediate-release formulations begin at 100mg twice daily, increasing to 100mg three times daily after a few days.  Extended-release formulations often begin at 150mg once daily, increasing to 150mg twice daily or higher, depending on response and tolerability. Maximum doses vary depending on the formulation.

* **Seasonal Affective Disorder:**  Similar to MDD, treatment begins with a low dose of the extended-release formulation and is adjusted based on response.

* **Smoking Cessation:** Extended-release formulations are commonly used.  Treatment begins at least a week before the target quit date, usually with a gradual dose increase.  Maintenance therapy may be considered for up to a year.

* **Off-label uses (ADHD, Bipolar Depression, SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction):** Dosage regimens for off-label use are variable and require careful titration under medical supervision.


**Children and Adolescents:**

Bupropion use in children and adolescents is generally limited to specific situations and formulations (primarily for depression refractory to SSRIs or smoking cessation in adolescents).  Dosage is determined by weight and age, and always requires careful monitoring by a physician.  Immediate-release and extended-release forms may be used.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are often necessary for individuals with hepatic or renal impairment.  Lower doses and/or less frequent administration might be recommended in these cases.  Caution is also advised when transitioning to or from MAO inhibitor antidepressants.

### How it Works

Bupropion is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). This means it works by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain. These neurotransmitters are involved in mood regulation, motivation, and attention. By increasing their levels in the brain, bupropion helps alleviate symptoms of depression and improve mood. Its mechanism of action in smoking cessation is not fully understood, but it may involve reducing nicotine withdrawal symptoms and cravings.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Bupropion is contraindicated in individuals with a history of seizures, eating disorders (anorexia nervosa/bulimia nervosa), hypersensitivity to bupropion, or those currently taking or recently discontinued MAO inhibitors.  It's also contraindicated in patients receiving linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.

* **Interactions:** Bupropion can interact with many other medications, potentially increasing or decreasing their effectiveness or side effects.  Examples include other antidepressants, certain antipsychotics, stimulants, and medications metabolized by the liver.

* **Warnings:** Bupropion can increase the risk of seizures, especially at higher doses.  Patients with conditions that lower the seizure threshold should use it with extreme caution.  There is also a risk of worsening psychiatric symptoms, including suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Close monitoring is crucial, particularly in younger adults.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration and should be discussed with a healthcare professional.
