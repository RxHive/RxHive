# Benztropine
### Generic Name
Benztropine

### Usage
Benztropine, also known as benztropine mesylate, is primarily used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) caused by medications, particularly antipsychotics.  EPS are a group of movement disorders that can include muscle stiffness, tremors, restlessness, and involuntary muscle spasms (dystonia).  Benztropine helps alleviate these symptoms by counteracting the effects of dopamine-blocking agents.  It's also used as an adjunctive therapy (meaning it's used alongside other medications) in the management of Parkinson's disease, helping to control tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slow movement).  It's important to note that benztropine is *not* used to treat tardive dyskinesia, a different type of movement disorder.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and their response to the medication.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  The following is general information and should not substitute for professional medical advice:

**Drug-induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms (Adults):**

* **Acute Treatment (IM, IV, or Oral):** Initial dose is typically 1-2 mg twice or three times daily.  For dystonic reactions, a higher initial dose may be given (1-2 mg) followed by oral doses. The maximum daily dose is 6 mg, and adjustments should be made gradually under medical supervision.

* **Prevention (IM or IV):** 1-2 mg may be administered before a potentially problematic drug (like an antipsychotic).

**Parkinsonism (Adults):**

* **Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease or Postencephalitic Parkinsonism (IM, IV, or Oral):**  Initial dose is usually lower (0.5-1 mg daily), typically given at bedtime or in divided doses. The dose is then gradually increased (in 0.5 mg increments every 5-6 days) until the desired effect is achieved, with a maximum daily dose of 6 mg.  Older or thinner patients might need a lower starting dose.

**Drug-induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms (Children >3 years):**

* Oral, IM, or IV: 0.02-0.05 mg/kg per dose, once or twice daily.  (Note: Benztropine is generally contraindicated in children under 3 years, except in life-threatening situations.)

**Parkinsonism (Children >3 years):**

* Oral, IM, or IV:  Starting dose is usually 0.5-1 mg at bedtime, gradually increased in 0.5 mg increments as needed.  The maximum daily dose is 6 mg.

**Important Note:**  The information above is a summary.  Your healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dosage and administration route for your specific situation.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Urinary retention
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Nausea
* Confusion
* Restlessness


Less common, but more serious side effects, include:

* Tachycardia (rapid heartbeat)
* Heat stroke (especially in hot environments)
* Hallucinations
* Psychotic symptoms (worsening of existing symptoms)


If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Benztropine is an anticholinergic drug.  It works primarily by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the brain. By reducing the activity of acetylcholine, it helps to restore the balance between acetylcholine and dopamine,  which is disrupted in extrapyramidal disorders and Parkinson's disease.  This balance restoration helps improve motor control and alleviate the associated symptoms.  Benztropine also possesses some antihistaminic properties, though their clinical significance is not fully established.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Benztropine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it, and generally not used in children under 3 years old (unless absolutely necessary).

* **Drug Interactions:** Benztropine can interact with many other drugs, including other anticholinergic medications, CNS depressants, and certain antidepressants. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.

* **Specific Populations:**  Older adults and those with certain pre-existing conditions (e.g., glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, bowel obstruction) may be at increased risk of adverse effects. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before using benztropine.

* **Heat Intolerance:**  Benztropine can impair the body's ability to regulate temperature, making individuals susceptible to heat stroke.  Avoid excessive heat and strenuous activity.

* **Impaired Alertness:** This medicine can cause drowsiness and impair cognitive function.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take benztropine with alcohol?**  A: No, alcohol can intensify the sedative effects of benztropine and increase the risk of side effects.  Avoid alcohol while taking this medication.

* **Q: How should I store benztropine?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking benztropine suddenly?** A:  No, you should gradually reduce the dosage under your doctor's guidance to avoid potential withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: Is benztropine habit-forming?** A: Benztropine is not typically considered habit-forming in the same way as opioids or other substances of abuse. However, it's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and treatment duration.
