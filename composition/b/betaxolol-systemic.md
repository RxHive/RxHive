# Betaxolol (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Betaxolol (Systemic)

### Usage
Betaxolol is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). It can be used alone or in combination with other blood pressure-lowering medications, especially thiazide diuretics.  While its primary indication is hypertension, betaxolol also has off-label uses including:  rate control in atrial fibrillation, prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery, and treatment of chronic stable angina.  These off-label uses require careful consideration and monitoring by a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Hypertension (primary use):**

* **Adults:** The initial oral dose is typically 5-10 mg once daily.  Elderly patients may start with a lower dose of 5 mg daily. After 7-14 days, the dose can be increased to a maximum of 20 mg once daily, depending on individual response and blood pressure control.

* **Children:** The safety and efficacy of betaxolol in children have not been established.


**Off-Label Uses (Atrial fibrillation, Postoperative atrial fibrillation prevention, Chronic stable angina):** The typical dose for these off-label uses is 20 mg once daily.  However, this requires careful medical supervision and should only be used under the guidance of a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:**  In patients with severe renal impairment, the initial dose should be 5 mg once daily, with gradual increases (every 2 weeks) to a maximum of 20 mg daily. This applies to patients on hemodialysis as well; supplemental doses are not necessary.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are generally not required for patients with hepatic impairment.


**Administration:** Betaxolol is administered orally as a tablet.  It should be taken as directed by a healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Betaxolol is a cardioselective beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocker.  This means it primarily affects beta-1 receptors located in the heart, slowing down the heart rate and reducing the force of its contractions.  This decreases the workload on the heart and helps lower blood pressure. It has minimal effects on beta-2 receptors found in the lungs and other parts of the body, minimizing the risk of bronchospasm (constriction of the airways).

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Betaxolol is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to betaxolol or any component of the formulation
* Sinus bradycardia (abnormally slow heart rate)
* Second- or third-degree heart block (except those with a pacemaker)
* Cardiogenic shock
* Uncompensated heart failure

**Warnings/Use with Caution:** Betaxolol should be used cautiously in patients with:

* History of severe anaphylaxis
* Bronchospastic disease (e.g., asthma)
* Cerebrovascular insufficiency
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Slow heart rate
* Diabetes mellitus
* Compensated heart failure
* Myasthenia gravis
* Renal impairment
* Peripheral vascular disease or Raynaud's phenomenon

**Drug Interactions:** Betaxolol can interact with many other medications, including but not limited to: other beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, and certain antidepressants.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications and supplements you are taking.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Betaxolol is categorized as pregnancy category C.  Other antihypertensive medications are preferred during pregnancy unless there are compelling reasons to use betaxolol. Betaxolol is excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised if used by breastfeeding mothers.
