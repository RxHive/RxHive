# Biperiden
### Generic Name
Biperiden

### Usage
Biperiden is a medication primarily used as an adjunctive treatment for various forms of Parkinsonism.  Its main role is to help manage symptoms like rigidity and tremor associated with this neurological disorder.  It's particularly helpful in controlling these motor symptoms, improving the patient's overall mobility and quality of life.  Beyond Parkinsonism, biperiden also finds application in treating drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which are movement disorders caused by certain medications.  Additionally, it may be used to address nocturnal cramps and pyramidal spasticity (increased muscle tone and stiffness).

### Dosage

Dosage of biperiden varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and the form of the medication (immediate-release tablets, controlled-release tablets, intramuscular [IM] or intravenous [IV] injection).  Always follow the instructions provided by a healthcare professional.  Specific dosage information is detailed below, but this is not exhaustive and should not be interpreted as a prescription.  **Consult a doctor or pharmacist for the correct dosage.**


**Adults:**

* **Drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):**  Dosage ranges widely depending on the route of administration and response.  IM/IV administration may start with 2.5-5mg, possibly repeated after 30 minutes, with a maximum daily dose of 20mg. Oral immediate-release dosages typically range from 1-4mg, 1-4 times daily, not exceeding 18mg/day.  Controlled-release formulations typically start at 4-8mg daily and can be adjusted as needed.

* **Parkinsonism:** IM/IV administration may start at 10-20mg/day in divided doses. Oral immediate-release may begin with 1mg twice daily, and be titrated upwards as needed, not exceeding 16mg/day. Controlled-release formulations often start at 4-8mg daily.

* **Pyramidal Spasticity:** Oral immediate-release may start at 1mg twice or three times daily, with potential increases to 4mg three times daily depending on response.

* **Nocturnal cramps:** Oral immediate-release may start at 4mg with the evening meal or 2mg twice, with a potential increase up to 12mg/day.


**Children:**  Biperiden use in children is not always approved and dosages are heavily dependent on age and weight.  A doctor must determine the appropriate dosage, if any. Dosage information for children, where applicable, is significantly lower than for adults and is always determined by a medical professional.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not currently provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Use in these cases should be approached with caution under strict medical supervision.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Difficulty urinating


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Confusion
* Hallucinations
* Delirium
* Agitation
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Increased intraocular pressure (potentially leading to glaucoma)

If you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Biperiden is an anticholinergic agent.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in muscle control and other bodily functions.  In Parkinson's disease, there's an imbalance between dopamine (another neurotransmitter) and acetylcholine. Biperiden helps to restore this balance by reducing the effects of acetylcholine, thus improving motor control. In the context of drug-induced EPS, it counteracts the effects of drugs that block dopamine, thereby mitigating the resulting movement problems.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Biperiden should not be used in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, bowel obstruction, paralytic ileus, narrow-angle glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, or prostate adenoma.  It's also contraindicated for concomitant use with diseases or agents that can induce significant tachycardia.

* **Interactions:** Biperiden can interact with other medications, including anticholinergic drugs, antihistamines, other antiparkinsonian drugs, antispasmodics, quinidine, levodopa, metoclopramide, and anticholinesterases.  Concomitant use of these medications with biperiden should be avoided or carefully managed under medical supervision.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Biperiden is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally discouraged unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. The medication may suppress lactation.

* **Specific Populations:**  Use in older adults, individuals with hepatic or renal impairment, and those with cardiac conditions should be approached with caution and under close medical supervision.  Dose adjustments may be necessary, and careful monitoring is crucial.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking biperiden abruptly?** A: No.  Abrupt withdrawal should be avoided as it can lead to adverse effects.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding tapering the dose.

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking biperiden?** A:  Drowsiness and dizziness are possible side effects of biperiden. You should avoid activities requiring alertness, such as driving or operating machinery, until you know how the medication affects you.

* **Q: How should I store biperiden?** A: Store biperiden as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Is biperiden suitable for treating tardive dyskinesia?** A:  No.  Biperiden is not recommended for patients with tardive dyskinesia; it may even worsen the symptoms.
