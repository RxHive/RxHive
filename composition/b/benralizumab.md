# Benralizumab
### Generic Name
Benralizumab

### Usage
Benralizumab is a prescription medication used as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma in adults and children 12 years and older.  It's specifically indicated for patients with a condition known as severe eosinophilic asthma. This means their asthma is severe, and a significant portion of their airway inflammation is driven by a type of white blood cell called eosinophils.  Benralizumab is *not* a rescue medication for sudden asthma attacks.


### Dosage
Benralizumab is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) using a pre-filled syringe or auto-injector.

* **Adults and children 12 years and older with severe eosinophilic asthma:** The initial dose is 30 mg given every 4 weeks for the first three doses.  Following this, the dose is then administered once every 8 weeks.

Dosage adjustments are not typically needed for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, but always consult a doctor for personalized guidance.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include the development of antibodies against Benralizumab.

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include:

* Headache
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Fever

Less common but serious side effects include hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction), angioedema (swelling under the skin), and other allergic reactions.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these.  

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to your healthcare provider.


### How it Works
Benralizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin-5 receptor (IL-5Rα) found on the surface of eosinophils and basophils.  These are types of white blood cells that play a significant role in the inflammatory process in asthma. By binding to the IL-5Rα, Benralizumab prevents IL-5 from stimulating these cells, ultimately leading to their death (apoptosis).  This reduction in eosinophils and basophils helps to lessen the inflammation in the airways, improving asthma symptoms.  The medication also enhances the activity of natural killer (NK) cells, which further contributes to the reduction of eosinophilic inflammation.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Benralizumab is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.  There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria (hives), and rash.
* **Asthma Management:**  Do not abruptly stop using your other asthma medications (e.g., inhaled or oral corticosteroids) when starting Benralizumab. A gradual reduction in dosage under medical supervision is recommended.
* **Infections:**  While not definitively proven, there's a theoretical concern about Benralizumab's potential impact on immune responses against parasitic infections.  Pre-existing helminth (parasitic worm) infections should be treated before starting Benralizumab.  Any new infections that develop during treatment should be addressed promptly.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of Benralizumab during pregnancy should be carefully considered, weighing the potential risks and benefits.  It's unknown whether Benralizumab is excreted in breast milk; this should be discussed with a healthcare provider.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Benralizumab?** A: The timeframe for noticing improvement varies among individuals.  Some patients experience benefits relatively quickly, while others may need several weeks or months.

* **Q: Can I take Benralizumab with other medications?** A: Discuss all your current medications (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements) with your doctor to ensure there are no harmful interactions.

* **Q: How should I store Benralizumab?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication packaging.  Generally, it should be refrigerated.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately to determine the best course of action.

* **Q: Is Benralizumab a cure for asthma?** A: No, Benralizumab is not a cure. It helps manage severe asthma symptoms but doesn't eliminate the underlying condition.
