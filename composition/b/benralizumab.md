# Benralizumab

**Generic Name:** Benralizumab

**Usage:** Benralizumab is a prescription medication used to treat severe eosinophilic asthma in adults and adolescents (12 years and older) and severe eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) in adults.  It's specifically used for patients whose asthma or EGPA is not adequately controlled with other medications.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, benralizumab can cause side effects.  Some common side effects include:

* **Injection site reactions:**  Pain, redness, swelling, itching at the injection site.
* **Infections:** Increased risk of upper respiratory tract infections (like colds), and other infections.
* **Headache:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Muscle pain (myalgia):**
* **Nausea:**

More serious, but less common side effects include:

* **Hypersensitivity reactions:**  These can range from mild skin reactions to severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Eosinophilia:**  Although paradoxically, a temporary increase in eosinophils may occur, especially early in treatment.  This doesn't necessarily indicate a problem, and monitoring is important.
* **Rare but serious neurological events:** such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (a rare disorder in which the body's immune system damages nerve cells), have been reported.


**How it Works:** Benralizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets IL-5 receptor alpha (IL-5Rα).  IL-5 is a cytokine (a signaling protein) that plays a crucial role in the growth and activation of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell.  In asthma and EGPA, eosinophils contribute significantly to inflammation in the airways and blood vessels. By binding to IL-5Rα, benralizumab prevents IL-5 from stimulating eosinophils, leading to a reduction in their numbers and activity, thus decreasing inflammation and improving symptoms.
