# Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ephedrine

**Generic Name:** Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ephedrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat symptoms of the common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections.  It combines the actions of an expectorant (Bromhexine), an antihistamine (Chlorpheniramine Maleate), and a decongestant (Ephedrine).  Specifically, it's aimed at relieving:

* **Cough:** Bromhexine helps to loosen and thin mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Runny nose and sneezing:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate blocks the action of histamine, reducing these allergic symptoms.
* **Nasal congestion:** Ephedrine constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and improving airflow.


**Side Effects:**  The side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** Particularly from Chlorpheniramine Maleate.
* **Dry mouth:** A common side effect of antihistamines.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Insomnia:** Especially with Ephedrine, if taken later in the day.
* **Increased heart rate:**  A potential effect of Ephedrine.
* **High blood pressure:**  A potential effect of Ephedrine.
* **Nervousness and anxiety:**  A potential effect of Ephedrine.
* **Difficulty urinating:**
* **Constipation:**
* **Allergic reactions:**  In rare cases, more serious allergic reactions can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.


**How it Works:**

* **Bromhexine (Expectorant):**  Reduces the viscosity of mucus, making it easier to expel from the respiratory tract. It stimulates the secretion of watery mucus to help thin the thicker, more difficult-to-cough-up phlegm.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate (Antihistamine):**  Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This helps to reduce symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
* **Ephedrine (Decongestant):**  A sympathomimetic amine that constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and improving airflow. This helps to relieve nasal congestion.
