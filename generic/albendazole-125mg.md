# Albendazole 125mg

**Generic Name:** Albendazole

**Usage:** Albendazole is an antihelminthic medication (a drug that treats parasitic worm infections).  It's used to treat a wide variety of worm infestations, including:

* **Ascariasis:** Roundworm infection
* **Hookworm infection:**  Necatoriasis and Ancylostoma
* **Trichuriasis:** Whipworm infection
* **Enterobiasis:** Pinworm infection
* **Strongyloidiasis:** Threadworm infection
* **Taeniasis:** Tapeworm infection (certain types)
* **Cysticercosis:**  Larval stage of tapeworm infection (requires higher doses and often longer treatment)
* **Hydatid disease:**  Severe infection caused by *Echinococcus* tapeworms (requires higher doses and often longer treatment)

**Note:** The specific usage and dosage will be determined by a doctor based on the type of infection, the severity, and the patient's age and health.  It is crucial to follow a doctor's prescription exactly.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Fever**
* **Increased liver enzymes (rare but important to monitor)**
* **Hair loss (rare)**
* **Allergic reactions (rare but potentially serious)**

Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention. These can include:

* **Severe liver damage**
* **Blood disorders**
* **Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)**

**How it Works:** Albendazole works by interfering with the worm's ability to absorb glucose, a vital energy source. This leads to paralysis and death of the parasitic worms, allowing the body to eliminate them.  The precise mechanism varies slightly depending on the type of worm.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take Albendazole without a prescription?** No.  Albendazole should only be taken under the guidance of a doctor who can diagnose the infection and determine the appropriate dosage and treatment duration. Self-treating parasitic infections can be dangerous.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Contact your doctor for instructions. Do not double the dose.

* **Can I take Albendazole with other medications?**  Inform your doctor of all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.  Albendazole can interact with certain drugs.

* **Are there any food restrictions while taking Albendazole?**  It's usually advised to take the medication with a fatty meal to improve absorption. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific dietary recommendations.

* **How long does it take to work?** The effectiveness of Albendazole varies depending on the infection.  Symptoms may start to improve within days or weeks, but complete eradication of the parasite may take longer. Follow-up examinations are crucial to ensure the treatment is successful.

* **What are the potential long-term effects?** Long-term effects are rare, but prolonged or high-dose use may increase the risk of liver damage. Regular monitoring is important, especially with high-dose or prolonged treatments.
