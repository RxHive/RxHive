title: Lactated Ringer
---

**Generic Name:** Lactated Ringer's Solution (also sometimes just called Ringer's Lactate)

**Usage:** Lactated Ringer's solution is an intravenous (IV) fluid used to:

* **Replenish fluids and electrolytes:**  It's used to treat dehydration caused by vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, or burns.  It helps restore the balance of fluids and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and lactate) in the body.
* **Expand blood volume:**  It can be used to increase blood volume in situations such as shock or hemorrhage (although blood transfusions are preferred for significant blood loss).
* **Treat metabolic acidosis:** The lactate in the solution helps correct a type of acidosis (increased acidity in the body).
* **Maintain fluid balance during surgery:** It's often used to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance during and after surgical procedures.

**Side Effects:** While generally safe, potential side effects can include:

* **Fluid overload:** This is a serious complication that can lead to pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), heart failure, or other problems, especially in individuals with pre-existing heart or kidney conditions.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Although designed to correct imbalances, improper administration can worsen existing imbalances or cause new ones.  This is particularly true for individuals with kidney impairment.
* **Alkalosis:** In rare instances, excessive administration can lead to alkalosis (increased blood pH).
* **Local reactions:**  Inflammation or pain at the IV insertion site.
* **Other rare side effects:**  These can include allergic reactions (though rare), thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein), and hyperkalemia (high potassium levels).

**How it Works:** Lactated Ringer's solution works by providing essential electrolytes and fluids directly into the bloodstream. The lactate in the solution is metabolized by the liver into bicarbonate, which helps to buffer the blood and correct metabolic acidosis.  The other electrolytes help restore the body's electrolyte balance, supporting proper cellular function.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Lactated Ringer's the same as Normal Saline?** No, while both are IV fluids, they have different compositions. Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) primarily contains sodium and chloride, whereas Lactated Ringer's contains a broader range of electrolytes, including potassium, calcium, and lactate.  The choice depends on the specific fluid and electrolyte needs of the patient.
* **Can I use Lactated Ringer's at home?** No, Lactated Ringer's solution is administered intravenously and requires medical supervision. It should only be used under the direction of a healthcare professional.
* **What are the contraindications?**  Lactated Ringer's should be used cautiously in patients with heart failure, kidney disease, liver disease, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), and metabolic alkalosis (high blood pH).  It's generally avoided in patients with lactic acidosis (a different type of acidosis).
* **What if I have an allergic reaction?** Stop the infusion immediately and seek medical attention.  Allergic reactions are rare but can be serious.
