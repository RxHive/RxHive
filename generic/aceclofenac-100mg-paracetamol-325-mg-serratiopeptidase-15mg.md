**Important Note:**  This information is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice. Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before using this or any medication, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.

**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:** This combination drug works through a synergistic effect of its three components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  A pain reliever and fever reducer that works by affecting the way the body senses pain and reduces fever.  Its exact mechanism is not fully understood.
* **Serratiopeptidase:** A proteolytic enzyme that helps break down proteins involved in inflammation and swelling.  It may also help reduce pain by reducing tissue swelling.  The effectiveness of serratiopeptidase is still under investigation and results are not always conclusive.

Together, these three components aim to provide comprehensive pain and inflammation relief.
