# Albendazole 400mg + Levamisole 6mg

**Generic Name:** Albendazole 400mg + Levamisole 6mg

**Usage:** This combination is primarily used to treat infections caused by parasitic worms (helminths), specifically those causing intestinal and tissue infestations.  It's often prescribed for:

* **Necatoriasis:** Hookworm infection.
* **Ascariasis:** Roundworm infection.
* **Strongyloidiasis:** Threadworm infection.
* **Trichuriasis:** Whipworm infection.
* **Ancylostomiasis:** Hookworm infection.


The specific parasites treated may vary depending on regional prevalence and the physician's assessment.  It's crucial to obtain a proper diagnosis before starting this medication.  This combination is not effective against all types of parasitic worms.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can range from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Fever**
* **Fatigue**
* **Rash**
* **Elevated liver enzymes (liver function tests)** - This requires monitoring.


More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* **Bone marrow suppression:** Leading to decreased blood cell counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia).
* **Hepatotoxicity:** Liver damage.
* **Stevens-Johnson syndrome:** A severe skin reaction.
* **Anaphylaxis:** A severe allergic reaction.


**How it Works:** Albendazole and levamisole are both anthelmintic drugs, meaning they kill or paralyze parasitic worms.  They work through different mechanisms:

* **Albendazole:** Interferes with the worm's ability to utilize glucose, leading to energy depletion and death.  It also affects the worm's microtubules, disrupting their cellular function.

* **Levamisole:** Stimulates the host's immune system to attack the parasites. It also has a direct anthelmintic effect by paralyzing the worms. The combination of both drugs increases effectiveness and broadens the spectrum of activity.
