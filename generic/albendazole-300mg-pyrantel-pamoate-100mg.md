# Albendazole 300mg + Pyrantel Pamoate 100mg

**Generic Name:** Albendazole 300mg + Pyrantel Pamoate 100mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat various intestinal worm infestations (helminthiasis) including:

* **Ascariasis:** Caused by *Ascaris lumbricoides* (roundworm).
* **Hookworm infection:** Caused by *Necator americanus* and *Ancylostoma duodenale*.
* **Trichuriasis:** Caused by *Trichuris trichiura* (whipworm).
* **Enterobiasis:** Caused by *Enterobius vermicularis* (pinworm).


It's crucial to note that the specific worms targeted and the dosage may vary depending on the individual's age, weight, and the type of infection.  A doctor's diagnosis and prescription are essential.  This medication is not a broad-spectrum antiparasitic and will not treat all types of parasitic infections.

**Side Effects:** Like all medications, Albendazole + Pyrantel Pamoate can cause side effects, although they are not experienced by everyone.  Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Sleep disturbances**
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling (rare but serious)


More serious side effects are rare but possible and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* **Liver damage:**  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), dark urine, and abdominal pain.

* **Severe allergic reactions:** Difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.


This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult a doctor or pharmacist for complete information and to report any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Albendazole:** This is a benzimidazole anthelmintic. It works by interfering with the worm's ability to absorb glucose, leading to paralysis and death of the parasite.  It's effective against a wider range of intestinal worms than pyrantel pamoate.

* **Pyrantel Pamoate:** This is a tetrahydropyrimidine derivative. It acts as a neuromuscular blocking agent, paralyzing the worms, which are then expelled from the body through the stool. It is particularly effective against roundworms and pinworms.

The combination of Albendazole and Pyrantel Pamoate provides broader coverage against multiple worm species, improving the effectiveness of treatment.
