# Acyclovir 200mg

**Generic Name:** Acyclovir

**Usage:** Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat infections caused by the herpes viruses, including:

* **Genital herpes:**  Reduces the frequency, duration, and severity of outbreaks.  It does *not* cure herpes.
* **Oral herpes (cold sores):** Shortens the duration and severity of outbreaks.
* **Chickenpox:** Shortens the duration and severity of illness, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.
* **Shingles (herpes zoster):** Reduces the duration and severity of pain and rash.
* **Herpes encephalitis (brain infection):**  Used to treat severe herpes simplex virus encephalitis.
* **Other herpesvirus infections:** May be used to treat other herpesvirus infections depending on the specific virus and the severity of the infection.  This is typically done under strict medical supervision.

**Note:**  Acyclovir is *not* a preventative medication. It treats existing infections but does not prevent future outbreaks.  Dosage and duration of treatment vary depending on the specific condition and the patient's health. Always follow your doctor's instructions.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Headache**
* **Nausea**
* **Vomiting**
* **Diarrhea**
* **Fatigue**
* **Rash**
* **Dizziness**
* **Kidney problems (rare, but serious, especially with high doses)**

More serious, though rare, side effects can include:

* **Seizures**
* **Confusion**
* **Hallucinations**
* **Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)**


**How it Works:** Acyclovir is a nucleoside analog.  This means it's a synthetic compound similar to the building blocks of DNA.  It works by interfering with the replication of the herpes virus's DNA.  The virus incorporates acyclovir into its DNA, preventing the virus from producing more copies of itself and ultimately slowing the progression of the infection.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take acyclovir to prevent herpes outbreaks?** A: No, acyclovir is a treatment for active herpes infections, not a preventative medication.  There are antiviral medications used for suppression (to reduce outbreaks) but a doctor needs to prescribe them and monitor for side effects.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The time it takes to notice a reduction in symptoms varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual.  You should start to see improvement within a few days, but complete resolution may take longer.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking acyclovir?** A: While there's no direct interaction between alcohol and acyclovir, excessive alcohol consumption can worsen some side effects, especially nausea and vomiting.  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally considered acceptable, but it's best to consult your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Can I buy acyclovir over the counter?** A: In many countries, acyclovir for oral herpes is available over the counter in lower doses. However, for other conditions, a prescription is required. Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for the appropriate dosage and treatment.
