* Osteoarthritis

* **Other:**  Fluid retention, changes in taste.


**How it Works:** This combination drug works through the synergistic action of its two components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Thiocolchicoside:** A muscle relaxant that reduces muscle spasms and stiffness, thereby alleviating pain.
