# Alectinib 150mg

**Generic Name:** Alectinib

**Usage:** Alectinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used to treat certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that have a specific genetic mutation called an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive mutation.  It's typically used as a first-line treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC or as a treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC that has progressed after treatment with other ALK inhibitors (like crizotinib).  The specific usage will be determined by a physician based on the patient's individual circumstances and medical history.

**Side Effects:**  Alectinib, like other TKIs, can cause a range of side effects, some common and some rare.  The severity and frequency vary from person to person.  Common side effects can include:

* **Constipation:** This is a frequently reported side effect.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Vomiting:**  Throwing up.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Cough:**  A persistent cough.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.
* **Increased liver enzymes:** This will be monitored through blood tests.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:** Numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet.
* **Increased weight:** Weight gain.
* **Elevated cholesterol and triglycerides:** This will be monitored through blood tests.

More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* **Interstitial lung disease (ILD):**  Inflammation of the lungs.  This is a serious side effect that requires immediate medical attention.
* **Pneumonitis:** Inflammation of the lungs.
* **Cardiovascular events:**  Such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* **Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):** Damage to the liver.


**It's crucial to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects.**  They can also advise on how to manage any side effects you experience.

**How it Works:** Alectinib works by blocking the ALK protein.  Cancer cells with an ALK mutation rely on this protein for growth and survival. By inhibiting ALK, alectinib prevents the cancer cells from growing and multiplying, leading to tumor shrinkage or stabilization.
