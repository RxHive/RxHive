# Acitretin 10mg

**Generic Name:** Acitretin

**Usage:** Acitretin is a retinoid medication used primarily to treat severe forms of psoriasis and other skin conditions like severe acne (specifically nodulocystic acne) that haven't responded to other treatments. It's a powerful medication and is typically reserved for cases where other less potent treatments have failed.

**Side Effects:** Acitretin has a wide range of potential side effects, some mild and some serious.  These can include:

* **Common:** Dry skin, chapped lips, dryness of mucous membranes (nose, mouth, eyes), itching, inflammation of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis), thinning of hair, peeling skin, increased sensitivity to sunlight, nausea, diarrhea.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Elevated liver enzymes, increased triglycerides and cholesterol, muscle pain, bone pain, headaches, depression, anxiety, pseudotumor cerebri (increased pressure in the brain), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), increased risk of birth defects.  
* **Rare but potentially very serious:**  Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), liver failure.


**How it Works:** Acitretin is a retinoid, meaning it's a derivative of vitamin A.  It works by slowing down the rapid growth of skin cells characteristic of psoriasis and severe acne.  It also reduces inflammation in the skin.  The exact mechanisms aren't fully understood, but it's believed to influence cell differentiation, proliferation, and keratinization (the process of skin cell hardening).

Blood tests may be required to confirm the absence of the drug in the system before considering pregnancy.
* **What if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
