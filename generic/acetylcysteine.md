# Acetylcysteine

**Generic Name:** Acetylcysteine

**Usage:**

* **Treatment of acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose:** This is the most common and crucial use. Acetylcysteine works to replenish glutathione, a vital antioxidant depleted by acetaminophen toxicity, thus preventing liver damage.  It must be administered promptly after an overdose.
* **Mucolytic agent:** Acetylcysteine breaks down mucus, making it thinner and easier to cough up.  It's used to treat respiratory conditions like bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and emphysema.  It can also be used to help thin mucus before certain medical procedures.

**Side Effects:**

Acetylcysteine's side effects can vary depending on the route of administration (oral vs. intravenous) and the dose.  Common side effects include:

* **Oral administration:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.  A rotten-egg smell is a characteristic odor of the medication and is usually temporary.
* **Intravenous administration:** Flushing, hypotension (low blood pressure), bronchospasm (narrowing of the airways), rash, and rarely, anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction).

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Liver damage (though this is less likely when used as directed for non-overdose situations)
* Severe allergic reactions


**How it Works:**

* **Acetaminophen overdose:** Acetylcysteine acts as a precursor to glutathione, a crucial antioxidant in the liver.  Acetaminophen overdose leads to depletion of glutathione, causing liver damage. Acetylcysteine helps replenish glutathione, allowing the liver to detoxify the acetaminophen.
* **Mucolytic agent:** Acetylcysteine breaks the disulfide bonds in mucus glycoproteins, reducing the viscosity (thickness) of mucus. This makes it easier to expectorate (cough up) the mucus, relieving congestion.


**FAQs:**

* **Is acetylcysteine safe?**  Generally, acetylcysteine is considered safe when used as directed by a healthcare professional.  However, like any medication, it can cause side effects.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should discuss its use with their doctor.
* **Can I take acetylcysteine with other medications?** It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting acetylcysteine. Interactions can occur.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Mild side effects like nausea might subside.  However, if you experience severe side effects such as difficulty breathing, swelling, or a severe allergic reaction, seek immediate medical attention.
* **Can I buy acetylcysteine over-the-counter?**  Mucolytic acetylcysteine preparations are often available over-the-counter for respiratory uses. However, the intravenous form used for acetaminophen overdose is only available through prescription.
* **How long does it take to work?** The effect of acetylcysteine as a mucolytic agent may be noticed within a few days.  In acetaminophen overdose, its effectiveness depends on timely administration.
