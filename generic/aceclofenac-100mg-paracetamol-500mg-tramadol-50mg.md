**How it Works:** This combination drug works through a synergistic effect of its three components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** A pain reliever and fever reducer that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs, likely involving inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes in the central nervous system.
* **Tramadol:** An opioid analgesic that binds to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, reducing the perception of pain.
