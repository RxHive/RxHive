# Acetylcysteine + Ambroxol

**Generic Name:** Acetylcysteine + Ambroxol

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat productive coughs (coughs that produce phlegm) associated with respiratory tract infections like bronchitis and pneumonia.  Acetylcysteine helps to thin and loosen the mucus, making it easier to cough up. Ambroxol helps to further loosen the mucus and also has a mild expectorant effect.  It's important to note that this combination is not a first-line treatment for all respiratory infections and should be used as directed by a doctor.

**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset.
* **Respiratory:**  Rarely, bronchospasm (narrowing of the airways) in susceptible individuals. This is more likely with acetylcysteine.
* **Other:** Headache, dizziness, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).

**How it Works:**

* **Acetylcysteine:**  Works as a mucolytic agent. It breaks down the disulfide bonds in mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expectorate.  It achieves this through its sulfhydryl group which breaks the disulfide bonds.
* **Ambroxol:** Acts as both a mucolytic and an expectorant.  It increases the secretion of watery mucus, helping to dilute and liquefy the thicker mucus already present.  It's believed to stimulate the production of surfactant (a substance that helps keep the lungs inflated).
