# Allopurinol 20mg

**Generic Name:** Allopurinol

**Usage:** Allopurinol is used to treat gout and kidney stones.  Specifically:

* **Gout:** It reduces the production of uric acid in the body.  High levels of uric acid can lead to gout attacks (severe joint pain and inflammation).  Allopurinol helps prevent future attacks by lowering uric acid levels.  It does *not* treat an acute gout attack; other medications are needed for that.
* **Kidney Stones:**  It can help prevent the formation of uric acid kidney stones in individuals prone to them.  Again, it's preventative, not a treatment for existing stones.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Rash:** This is a relatively common side effect and can range from mild to severe.  A severe rash is a serious concern and requires immediate medical attention.
* **Nausea:** Some individuals experience nausea, sometimes accompanied by vomiting.
* **Diarrhea:**  Loose or watery stools.
* **Headache:**  Mild to moderate headaches.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or faint.
* **Muscle pain:**  Aches and pains in the muscles.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Liver problems:**  Abnormal liver function tests.
* **Kidney problems:**  Changes in kidney function.
* **Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN):**  These are rare but potentially life-threatening skin reactions.
* **Blood disorders:**  Changes in blood cell counts.


**How it Works:** Allopurinol works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, an enzyme involved in the breakdown of purines. Purines are naturally occurring substances in the body that are broken down into uric acid. By inhibiting xanthine oxidase, allopurinol reduces the production of uric acid, thereby lowering uric acid levels in the blood and preventing the formation of urate crystals that cause gout and kidney stones.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take allopurinol during a gout attack?**  A: No. Allopurinol is for preventing future attacks, not treating an existing one.  Other medications (like NSAIDs or colchicine) are used to treat acute gout attacks.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: It can take several weeks or months for allopurinol to lower uric acid levels effectively.  Consistent use is crucial.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience a rash?** A:  Stop taking allopurinol immediately and contact your doctor. A rash can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction.
* **Q:  Should I change my diet while taking allopurinol?** A: Your doctor may recommend dietary changes, such as reducing purine-rich foods, to further support uric acid control.  Discuss this with your doctor or a registered dietitian.
* **Q:  Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, allopurinol can interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Q: Is allopurinol safe for everyone?** A:  No. People with certain pre-existing conditions (such as severe kidney disease) may not be able to take allopurinol.  Your doctor will assess your suitability for this medication.
