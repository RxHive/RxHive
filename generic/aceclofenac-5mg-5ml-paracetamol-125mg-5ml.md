**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 5mg/5ml + Paracetamol 125mg/5ml (This is a combination drug, so both names are listed)

* Mild to moderate pain (e.g., headache, toothache, muscle aches)

**It is crucial to note:** This information is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice.  Always consult a pediatrician or doctor before giving this or any medication to a child.  The dosage, frequency, and duration of treatment should be determined by a healthcare professional based on the child's age, weight, and specific condition. Self-medication can be dangerous.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Belongs to a class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It works by reducing the production of substances in the body that cause pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever and provides mild to moderate pain relief through a mechanism not fully understood, but thought to involve affecting certain chemicals in the brain.

The combination provides both anti-inflammatory and analgesic (pain-relieving) effects, offering broader pain and fever relief.
