# Aflibercept 40mg/ml

**Generic Name:** Aflibercept

**Usage:**  Aflibercept is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor used to treat several eye diseases that cause vision loss due to abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina:

* **Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD):**  This is the most common use.  Aflibercept helps reduce fluid leakage from abnormal blood vessels in the macula, the part of the eye responsible for sharp central vision.
* **Diabetic Macular Edema (DME):**  Aflibercept reduces swelling in the macula caused by diabetic retinopathy.
* **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR):**  Specifically, it treats clinically significant macular edema (CSME) in patients with diabetic retinopathy.
* **Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO):** Including branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).  Aflibercept helps reduce swelling and vision loss associated with these conditions.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, aflibercept can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Eye-related:**  Eye pain, redness, increased eye pressure (intraocular pressure), bleeding in the eye, retinal detachment, cataract, vitreous hemorrhage.
* **Systemic (body-wide):** Headache, high blood pressure, nosebleed, increased risk of infection.
* **Rare but serious:**  Heart attack, stroke, blood clots.

**It's crucial to note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  The frequency and severity of side effects can vary from person to person.  Always report any concerning side effects to your ophthalmologist or doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Aflibercept is a fusion protein designed to bind to and neutralize certain forms of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor).  VEGF is a protein that stimulates the growth of new blood vessels.  In the eye diseases mentioned above, abnormal blood vessel growth leads to leakage of fluid and bleeding, damaging the retina and causing vision loss. By blocking VEGF, aflibercept reduces this abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage, helping to preserve vision.


**FAQs:**

* **How is aflibercept administered?**  It's administered by injection directly into the eye (intravitreal injection) by an ophthalmologist.
* **How often is aflibercept injected?**  The frequency of injections varies depending on the disease and the individual's response to treatment. It can range from monthly to less frequent intervals.
* **Is aflibercept covered by insurance?** Coverage varies depending on the insurance plan and country.  It's important to check with your insurance provider.
* **What are the potential long-term effects of aflibercept?** Long-term effects are still being studied, but potential concerns include the possibility of increased intraocular pressure and the rare risk of serious systemic events. Regular eye exams are crucial for monitoring.
* **Are there any interactions with other medications?**  Inform your ophthalmologist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Contact your ophthalmologist to reschedule your injection as soon as possible.
