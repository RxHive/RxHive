# Ado-trastuzumab emtansine 160mg

**Generic Name:** Ado-trastuzumab emtansine

**Usage:** Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is used to treat HER2-positive breast cancer.  Specifically, it's indicated for:

* **Patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer** who have received prior therapy with trastuzumab and a taxane.  This is often a later-line treatment option after other therapies have been tried.
* In some cases, it may be used in combination with other therapies.  The specific treatment plan will be determined by a physician based on the individual patient's condition and medical history.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, ado-trastuzumab emtansine can cause side effects.  Some of the most common include:

* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  These can often be managed with anti-nausea medication.
* **Low blood cell counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia):** This increases the risk of infection, bleeding, and fatigue. Regular blood tests are needed to monitor this.
* **Alopecia (hair loss):** This can be temporary or permanent.
* **Diarrhea:**  Can range from mild to severe.
* **Constipation:**
* **Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the hands and feet):** Can cause numbness, tingling, or pain.
* **Liver function abnormalities:**  Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor liver function.
* **Increased risk of infections:** Due to the low blood cell count.
* **Cardiac toxicity (heart damage):** Although less frequent than with some other HER2-targeted therapies, it's a potential risk.  Cardiac function is usually monitored before, during, and after treatment.


**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list of side effects.  More serious side effects are possible.  Patients should report any new or worsening symptoms to their doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is a type of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). It works by targeting HER2 receptors, which are often overexpressed in HER2-positive breast cancer cells.  The "antibody" part (trastuzumab) binds specifically to the HER2 receptors on cancer cells.  The "drug" part (emtansine, a microtubule inhibitor) is then delivered directly to the cancer cells, disrupting their ability to divide and grow.  This targeted delivery minimizes damage to healthy cells.
