# Alfuzosin 10mg

**Generic Name:** Alfuzosin

**Usage:**

Alfuzosin is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also known as an enlarged prostate.  It relaxes the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, making urination easier.  It is specifically an alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blocker. It is *not* used to treat erectile dysfunction, although it may have some indirect effects on this.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Headache
* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Weakness
* Fast heartbeat
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Swelling in the ankles or feet


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Priapism (prolonged and painful erection) â€“ seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* Fainting
* Sudden drop in blood pressure, especially when standing up (orthostatic hypotension)


**How it Works:**

Alfuzosin works by blocking alpha-1-adrenergic receptors in the prostate and bladder neck. These receptors cause the muscles in these areas to contract. By blocking these receptors, alfuzosin relaxes the muscles, allowing urine to flow more easily.
