# Afatinib dimaleate 50mg

**Generic Name:** Afatinib dimaleate

**Usage:** Afatinib dimaleate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used to treat certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Specifically, it's indicated for:

* **Metastatic NSCLC:**  Patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a specific genetic mutation called an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) substitution, *and* who have progressed after treatment with a first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (like gefitinib or erlotinib).
* **Metastatic NSCLC (certain subtypes):**  It may also be used in some cases of metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitutions that have not received prior EGFR TKI treatment, though this is less common.  A physician will determine the appropriate use based on the individual patient and their specific situation.


**Side Effects:** Afatinib can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These include:

* **Common:** Diarrhea (often severe), rash, dry skin, nail changes (thickening, discoloration), fatigue, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, stomatitis (mouth sores).
* **Serious:**  Interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis (lung inflammation), severe diarrhea leading to dehydration, skin reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis), liver problems (hepatotoxicity),  electrolyte imbalances (especially potassium and magnesium),  cardiovascular events (such as heart failure).
* **Other Potential Side Effects:**  Eye irritation, blurry vision, changes in taste, weight loss, muscle pain, headache.

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary greatly among individuals.  It's crucial to report any concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.


**How it Works:** Afatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  It works by blocking the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a protein that promotes the growth and division of cancer cells.  By inhibiting EGFR, afatinib helps to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells that rely on this receptor for survival and proliferation.  Specifically, it irreversibly binds to the EGFR, making it more potent than reversible inhibitors.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is Afatinib taken?**  A: Afatinib is usually taken orally once daily with or without food.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment are determined by a doctor.

* **Q: What are the drug interactions of Afatinib?** A:  Afatinib can interact with many other drugs.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking. Some interactions can increase the risk of side effects or reduce the effectiveness of afatinib.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Afatinib?** A: Long-term use of Afatinib can lead to cumulative side effects. Regular monitoring by a physician is essential to manage potential complications.

* **Q: Is Afatinib right for me?** A: Only a qualified oncologist can determine if afatinib is the appropriate treatment for your specific type of cancer and medical history.  They will consider your overall health, other medical conditions, and the results of your cancer tests to make the best decision.
