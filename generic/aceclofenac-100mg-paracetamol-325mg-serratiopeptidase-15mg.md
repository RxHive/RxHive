**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Serratiopeptidase 15mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Post-operative pain and inflammation
* Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea)
* Soft tissue injuries (sprains, strains)
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic inflammation and edema reduction (due to serratiopeptidase)


**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list, and the specific conditions it's used for will depend on a doctor's assessment.  It's crucial to use this medication only as prescribed by a healthcare professional.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* Gastrointestinal issues:  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea

* Skin rash or itching

If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.  This is not a complete list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary between individuals.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  A pain reliever and fever reducer that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs, likely by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes in the central nervous system.
* **Serratiopeptidase:** A proteolytic enzyme derived from the bacteria *Serratia E15*. It is believed to reduce inflammation and edema (swelling) by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory process. This contributes to faster healing and pain reduction, particularly in post-surgical or post-traumatic situations.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take this medication with other drugs?**  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential drug interactions.  This combination can interact with blood thinners, other NSAIDs, and certain heart medications.
* **How long can I take this medication?** The duration of treatment depends on the condition being treated and should be determined by your doctor.  Long-term use of NSAIDs can carry increased risks.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Alcohol can increase the risk of stomach upset and other side effects. It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication, especially if you have a history of stomach problems.
* **Who shouldn't take this medication?** This medication is not suitable for everyone.  People with certain medical conditions (e.g., severe liver or kidney disease, bleeding disorders, peptic ulcers, allergies to any of the components) should not take this medication.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before use.
* **Is this medication safe for long-term use?** Long-term use of NSAIDs, especially aceclofenac, increases the risk of serious side effects.  Your doctor will assess the risks and benefits of long-term use on a case-by-case basis.
