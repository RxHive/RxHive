# Acyclovir 400mg

**Generic Name:** Acyclovir

**Usage:**

Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat infections caused by herpes viruses, including:

* **Genital herpes:**  Reduces the frequency and severity of outbreaks.  It does *not* cure herpes.
* **Herpes labialis (cold sores):** Shortens the duration and severity of outbreaks.
* **Shingles (herpes zoster):** Reduces the pain and duration of the rash.
* **Chickenpox (varicella):** Reduces the severity and duration of the illness, particularly in high-risk individuals.
* **Herpes encephalitis:** A severe brain infection caused by herpes simplex virus.
* **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections:** In immunocompromised individuals, acyclovir can help manage CMV infections, though other medications may be more effective.


**Note:**  Acyclovir is only effective against herpes viruses; it does not treat other types of infections.  The dosage and duration of treatment will vary depending on the specific infection and the patient's health.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects are generally mild and can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Rash

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Seizures
* Confusion
* Tremors
* Kidney problems (especially with high doses or in individuals with pre-existing kidney issues)
* Blood disorders


**How it Works:**

Acyclovir is a nucleoside analogue.  This means it mimics a building block of DNA.  Once inside a herpes virus-infected cell, acyclovir is converted into a form that inhibits the viral DNA polymerase, an enzyme essential for the virus to replicate its DNA.  By blocking this enzyme, acyclovir stops the virus from multiplying and spreading.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take acyclovir to prevent herpes outbreaks?**  A:  Yes, in some cases, your doctor may prescribe acyclovir for suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of outbreaks.  This is particularly common for genital herpes.

* **Q: How long does it take for acyclovir to work?** A:  This depends on the type and severity of the infection.  You may see improvements within a few days, but full resolution may take longer.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking acyclovir?** A:  Generally, moderate alcohol consumption isn't expected to cause problems, but itâ€™s always best to consult your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Q: Can I take acyclovir if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  Acyclovir can be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but only under the close supervision of a doctor.  The benefits must outweigh the potential risks.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once to make up for a missed dose.
