# Aceclofenac 500mg + Paracetamol 125mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 500mg + Paracetamol 125mg  (Note: This combination is not standard in many regions.  Aceclofenac is more commonly combined with Paracetamol in lower ratios, e.g., 100mg/325mg or 100mg/500mg.  The 500mg/125mg ratio might be less common or even unavailable depending on your location. Always check with your local pharmacy or doctor for availability and appropriateness.)


**Usage:**  This combination medication is typically used to relieve moderate to severe pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic pain
* Other inflammatory conditions (as prescribed by a doctor)

**Important Note:** This medication should only be used as directed by a doctor.  Self-medicating with this combination, especially in the specified ratio, is not recommended.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, indigestion, heartburn, ulcers (rare but serious), bleeding (rare but serious).
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Skin:** Rash, itching, hives.
* **Liver:**  Abnormal liver function tests (rare but serious).
* **Kidney:**  Kidney problems (rare but serious), especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Anaphylaxis (rare but serious).


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain and swelling.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's believed to act on the central nervous system to reduce pain and fever.  The combination aims for a synergistic effect, meaning the pain relief is greater than the sum of each drug's individual effect.  However, this synergistic effect is not always guaranteed and depends on individual factors.
