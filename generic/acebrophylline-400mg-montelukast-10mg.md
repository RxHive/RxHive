# Acebrophylline 400mg  + Montelukast 10mg

**Generic Name:** Acebrophylline 400mg + Montelukast 10mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to prevent and treat symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Acebrophylline is a bronchodilator that relaxes the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe. Montelukast is a leukotriene modifier that blocks the action of leukotrienes, substances in the body that cause inflammation and narrowing of the airways.  This combination provides both bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory effects.  It's important to note that this specific combination isn't widely available as a single pre-mixed product;  the two medications are often prescribed separately.  The combination, if prescribed, would typically be for patients who require both a bronchodilator and a leukotriene modifier.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual.  Common side effects may include:

* **Acebrophylline:** Headache, nervousness, insomnia, nausea, upset stomach, palpitations.  In rare cases, more serious side effects such as seizures may occur.
* **Montelukast:** Headache, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, sleep disturbances.  Rare but serious side effects may include depression, suicidal thoughts or behaviors, liver problems, and allergic reactions.

This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of possible side effects.  If you experience any severe or unusual side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:**

* **Acebrophylline:**  Works by relaxing the muscles around the airways in the lungs (bronchodilation). This widening of the airways helps improve airflow and reduces breathlessness.  It achieves this by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic AMP, a molecule crucial for smooth muscle relaxation.
* **Montelukast:** Works by blocking the action of leukotrienes.  Leukotrienes are inflammatory substances that trigger bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways), mucus production, and inflammation in the lungs. By blocking these substances, montelukast reduces airway inflammation and improves lung function.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and herbal supplements.  Some medications may interact with acebrophylline or montelukast.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Alcohol can interact with some medications and may worsen certain side effects.  Consult your doctor about alcohol consumption while on this medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q:  How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies between the two medications. Acebrophylline works relatively quickly, providing immediate bronchodilation. Montelukast requires regular use for several days or even weeks to achieve its full anti-inflammatory effects.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A:  No, you should never stop taking this medication suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation may worsen your asthma or COPD symptoms.
