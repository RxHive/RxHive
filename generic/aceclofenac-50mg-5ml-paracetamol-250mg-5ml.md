# Aceclofenac 50mg/5ml + Paracetamol 250mg/5ml

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac + Paracetamol Oral Suspension (This is a combination drug, so the generic name reflects both active ingredients.)

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and reduce fever.  It's often prescribed for mild to moderate pain associated with various conditions like:

* Headaches
* Muscle aches
* Toothaches
* Menstrual cramps
* Post-surgical pain
* Pain from arthritis (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis)
* Fever

**Important Note:**  The specific usage and dosage should always be determined by a doctor.  This information is for general knowledge only and does not constitute medical advice.  Never self-treat or change your dosage without consulting a healthcare professional.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Aceclofenac + Paracetamol can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach upset
* Heartburn
* Dizziness
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

More serious, but less common, side effects can occur.  These require immediate medical attention and include:

* Severe stomach pain
* Blood in vomit or stool
* Difficulty breathing
* Swelling of the face, lips, or tongue
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)
* Unusual bruising or bleeding

This is not an exhaustive list of side effects.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list and to discuss any concerns.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). Its exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's believed to affect the way the brain responds to pain and reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamus.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a broader analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect than either drug alone, making it effective for a wider range of pain and fever conditions.
