# Adenosylcobalamin 100mcg + Carbonyl Iron 100mg + Folic Acid 1500mcg + Zinc Sulfate 61.5mg

**Generic Name:** Adenosylcobalamin 100mcg + Carbonyl Iron 100mg + Folic Acid 1500mcg + Zinc Sulfate 61.5mg  (Note: This is a combination product; there isn't one single generic name.)

**Usage:** This combination is typically used to treat or prevent deficiencies in vitamin B12 (adenosylcobalamin), iron, folate (folic acid), and zinc.  It's often prescribed for conditions associated with these deficiencies, such as:

* **Megaloblastic anemia:**  A type of anemia caused by deficiencies in vitamin B12 and/or folate.
* **Iron-deficiency anemia:** A type of anemia caused by a lack of iron.
* **Nutrient deficiencies:**  In individuals with poor diets, malabsorption issues (e.g., Crohn's disease, celiac disease), or increased nutritional needs (e.g., pregnancy, lactation).
* **Neurological symptoms related to B12 deficiency:**  B12 deficiency can cause neurological problems, and this combination may help alleviate them.


**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage. Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain.  These are more common with iron supplementation.
* **Skin reactions:** Itching, rash.
* **Headache:**  Less common.
* **Darkening of stool:** This is a common side effect of iron supplements.


**How it Works:**

* **Adenosylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):**  Essential for the formation of red blood cells, nerve function, and DNA synthesis.
* **Carbonyl Iron (Iron):**  A component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.
* **Folic Acid (Vitamin B9):**  Crucial for red blood cell production and DNA synthesis. Works synergistically with B12.
* **Zinc Sulfate (Zinc):**  Involved in numerous bodily functions, including immune function, wound healing, and protein synthesis.
