**How it Works:** This combination medication works through a synergistic effect of its components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals involved in the inflammatory response.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs, reducing pain and fever but with less anti-inflammatory effect.
* **Trypsin Chymotrypsin:**  Proteolytic enzymes that help break down proteins involved in inflammation and edema. They may reduce swelling and promote faster healing of injured tissues.  Their efficacy in this context is still under investigation and debated among medical professionals.
