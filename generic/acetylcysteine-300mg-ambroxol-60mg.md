# Acetylcysteine 300mg + Ambroxol 60mg

**Generic Name:** Acetylcysteine 300mg + Ambroxol 60mg (This combination doesn't have a single, widely accepted generic name.  The names will vary by manufacturer.)


**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat productive coughs (coughs that produce mucus) associated with respiratory tract infections like bronchitis and pneumonia.  Acetylcysteine helps to thin and loosen the mucus, making it easier to cough up. Ambroxol helps to further thin the mucus and improve its clearance from the airways.  It is typically used as a short-term treatment for acute conditions.  **Always follow the dosage instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.**


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Nausea:** A feeling of sickness.
* **Vomiting:** Being sick.
* **Diarrhoea:** Loose, watery stools.
* **Stomach upset:** Including abdominal pain or discomfort.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling faint or lightheaded.
* **Mouth sores:** Ulcers or irritation in the mouth.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but possible, including rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.


**Serious side effects are rare but should be reported to your doctor immediately.** These might include severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), liver damage (especially with high doses of Acetylcysteine), and severe gastrointestinal problems.


**How it Works:**

* **Acetylcysteine:**  Acts as a mucolytic agent.  It breaks down the disulfide bonds in mucus, making it less viscous (thicker) and easier to expectorate (cough up).
* **Ambroxol:** Acts as a secretolytic and mucoactive agent.  It increases the production of surfactant (a substance that reduces surface tension in the lungs) and stimulates the movement of cilia (tiny hair-like structures in the airways that help move mucus). This combined action helps to thin and clear mucus from the airways.
