# Acyclovir 5% w/w

**Generic Name:** Acyclovir

**Usage:** Acyclovir 5% w/w is a topical antiviral medication used to treat herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) infections.  This typically manifests as cold sores (oral herpes) or genital herpes.  It's applied directly to the affected skin area.  **Important Note:**  The 5% w/w formulation is specifically for topical use and should not be ingested. Oral or intravenous acyclovir is used for systemic infections and has different dosages and precautions.  This information refers solely to the 5% w/w topical application.

**Side Effects:**  Topical acyclovir generally has mild side effects. These can include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site.
* Mild itching or redness.
* Skin dryness or peeling.
* Rarely, more severe allergic reactions such as rash, hives, or difficulty breathing can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if this happens.

**How it Works:** Acyclovir is a nucleoside analog.  It works by inhibiting the replication of the herpes virus.  It's incorporated into the viral DNA, preventing the virus from multiplying and spreading.  This helps to reduce the severity and duration of the symptoms.  However, it does not cure the herpes virus; it only manages outbreaks.

**FAQs:**
