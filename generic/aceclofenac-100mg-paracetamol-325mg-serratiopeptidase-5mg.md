# Aceclofenac 100mg  + Paracetamol 325mg  + Serratiopeptidase 5mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Serratiopeptidase 5mg

**Usage:** This combination drug is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

* **Osteoarthritis:** Pain and inflammation in joints due to cartilage breakdown.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis:**  Pain and inflammation in joints due to an autoimmune response.
* **Post-surgical pain:** Pain after surgery or other procedures.

* **Soft tissue injuries:**  Pain and inflammation from sprains, strains, and other soft tissue injuries.


**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list, and this medication should only be used as directed by a doctor.  Self-medicating can be dangerous.


**Side Effects:**  Possible side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, indigestion, ulcers (rare but serious).
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (seek immediate medical attention if these occur).
* **Central nervous system:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness.
* **Liver and kidney effects:** Elevated liver enzymes (rare), kidney problems (rare, particularly in individuals with pre-existing kidney issues).
* **Other:**  Increased bleeding time (especially if you are also taking anticoagulants), changes in blood counts.


**How it Works:** This combination drug works through three different mechanisms:

* **Aceclofenac (100mg):** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (325mg):**  An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs. Its exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it is thought to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.
* **Serratiopeptidase (5mg):** A proteolytic enzyme that helps to reduce inflammation and swelling by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory process.  It may also help to reduce pain by reducing tissue swelling and improving blood flow.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medications?** A:  You should always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking before starting this medication.  Certain interactions can occur, especially with blood thinners (anticoagulants), other NSAIDs, and medications affecting the liver or kidneys.
* **Q: How long should I take this medication?** A:  The duration of treatment depends on your condition and should be determined by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage or duration.

Inform your doctor if you have a history of liver or kidney disease, ulcers, bleeding disorders, or allergies to NSAIDs.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before use.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Mild side effects may resolve on their own. However, if you experience severe side effects or side effects that persist, contact your doctor immediately.
