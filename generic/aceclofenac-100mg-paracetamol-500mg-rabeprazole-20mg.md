# Aceclofenac 100mg  + Paracetamol 500mg  + Rabeprazole 20mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 500mg + Rabeprazole 20mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Post-operative or post-traumatic pain
* Mild to moderate pain

The individual components work as follows:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).  It works differently than NSAIDs.
* **Rabeprazole:** A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces stomach acid production.  This is included to help protect the stomach lining from the potential ulcer-causing effects of aceclofenac.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, indigestion, flatulence, gastritis.  These are more likely without the rabeprazole component.
* **Central Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Skin:** Rash, itching, hives.
* **Other:**  Increased liver enzyme levels (rare but serious), edema (swelling), allergic reactions (rare but potentially serious).

**Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention. These include:**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Stomach ulcers or bleeding
* Liver damage
* Kidney problems


**How it Works:**

This combination medication works by targeting different aspects of pain and inflammation:

* **Aceclofenac:** Reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that contribute to pain and swelling.
* **Paracetamol:** Reduces fever and pain through a mechanism that is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.
* **Rabeprazole:** Decreases the production of stomach acid, protecting the stomach lining from the potentially damaging effects of aceclofenac, a common side effect of NSAIDs.

**FAQs:**

* **Who shouldn't take this medication?**  People with known allergies to any of the components, those with severe liver or kidney disease, active peptic ulcer disease, bleeding disorders, or pregnant/breastfeeding women should generally avoid this medication.  Consult a doctor before taking this medication if you have any pre-existing health conditions.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication, as it can increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
* **How long can I take this medication?**  The duration of treatment will depend on the condition being treated.  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Long-term use should be monitored closely by a physician.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is close to the time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **What are the interactions with other medications?**  This medication can interact with several other drugs, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), other NSAIDs, and certain antidepressants.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.
