# Ringers lactate

**Generic Name:** Lactated Ringer's Solution (also known as Ringer's lactate)

**Usage:** Lactated Ringer's solution is an intravenous (IV) fluid used to:

* **Expand extracellular fluid volume:**  This is its primary function. It replaces fluids and electrolytes lost due to various conditions.
* **Treat dehydration:**  It helps rehydrate the body when dehydration occurs from vomiting, diarrhea, burns, excessive sweating, or other causes.
* **Treat hypovolemia:** This refers to low blood volume.
* **Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance:**  It provides essential electrolytes like sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride, which are crucial for bodily functions.
* **Alkalinize the blood (to a limited extent):** The lactate component can help correct mild acidosis (increased blood acidity).  However, it is not a primary treatment for severe acidosis.
* **Post-operative fluid maintenance:** It's often used to replenish fluids lost during surgery.


**Side Effects:** While generally safe, Lactated Ringer's solution can cause some side effects, including:

* **Fluid overload:** This is a serious complication, especially in patients with heart or kidney problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, swelling in the legs and ankles, and weight gain.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:** Although designed to correct imbalances, giving too much can lead to new or worsened imbalances of sodium, potassium, calcium, or chloride.
* **Metabolic alkalosis:** In rare cases, particularly in patients with liver disease, the lactate can be metabolized too quickly, leading to increased blood pH (alkalosis).
* **Infection at the IV site:**  This is a risk with any IV infusion.
* **Thrombophlebitis:** Inflammation of the vein at the IV site.


**How it Works:** Lactated Ringer's solution works by providing a balanced electrolyte solution that mimics the composition of the body's extracellular fluid.  This allows for efficient absorption and distribution throughout the body. The lactate component is metabolized by the liver into bicarbonate, which helps buffer blood acidity.  The solution expands the intravascular (blood vessel) volume, increasing blood pressure and improving tissue perfusion (blood flow).

**FAQs:**

* **Is Lactated Ringer's the same as Normal Saline?** No, while both are IV fluids, they have different electrolyte compositions. Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) contains only sodium and chloride, while Lactated Ringer's contains sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, and lactate.  The choice depends on the specific needs of the patient.

* **Who should not receive Lactated Ringer's?** Patients with severe heart failure, kidney failure, or certain liver diseases should receive Lactated Ringer's with caution or not at all, as they may be more susceptible to fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.

* **Can I give Lactated Ringer's to myself?** No. Lactated Ringer's solution must be administered intravenously by a trained medical professional.  Self-administration is extremely dangerous.

* **What are the signs of fluid overload?**  Signs of fluid overload include shortness of breath, swelling in the legs and ankles, rapid weight gain, and increased blood pressure.  Seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms occur.
