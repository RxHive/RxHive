# Acetazolamide

**Generic Name:** Acetazolamide

**Usage:**

Acetazolamide is a diuretic (water pill) and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.  It's primarily used to treat:

* **Glaucoma:**  Reduces intraocular pressure (pressure inside the eye).  Often used in combination with other glaucoma medications.
* **Epilepsy (certain types):** Helps control seizures, particularly those involving absences (petit mal seizures).
* **Altitude sickness (acute mountain sickness):** Helps prevent or treat symptoms like headache, nausea, and shortness of breath.
* **Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri):** Reduces pressure in the brain.
* **Metabolic alkalosis:** Helps correct the body's acid-base balance.  This is less common than other uses.
* **Periodic paralysis:** In certain types of this condition, it can help prevent attacks.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Tingling in the fingers and toes (paresthesia):** This is a common side effect and usually mild.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** These can be bothersome, but often subside with continued use or dose adjustment.
* **Diarrhea:**  Another common gastrointestinal side effect.
* **Loss of appetite:**  Can lead to weight loss if severe.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or lacking energy.
* **Headache:** Can be mild to moderate in severity.
* **Drowsiness:**  May affect ability to drive or operate machinery.
* **Metallic taste:** An unpleasant taste in the mouth.
* **Kidney stones:** A less common but potentially serious side effect.


Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or chest tightness.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Including low levels of potassium, sodium, or chloride.
* **Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas):**  Requires immediate medical attention.
* **Liver problems:**  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes) or dark urine.
* **Blood disorders:**  Rare but potentially serious.
* **Bone marrow suppression:**  Decreased production of blood cells.


**How it Works:**

Acetazolamide works by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that plays a role in the formation of fluid in the eye, kidneys, and brain. By inhibiting this enzyme, it reduces the production of fluid, which helps lower pressure in the eye (in glaucoma), reduces fluid in the brain (in idiopathic intracranial hypertension), and increases the excretion of bicarbonate in the urine (leading to diuresis).  In epilepsy, its mechanism isn't fully understood but it's thought to affect the electrical activity of the brain.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking acetazolamide?**  Alcohol can worsen some side effects, especially drowsiness and nausea.  It's best to avoid or limit alcohol consumption.
* **Can I take acetazolamide if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Discuss this with your doctor.  Acetazolamide can pass into breast milk and its use during pregnancy should be carefully considered.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.
* **How long does it take to work?** This depends on the condition being treated.  For altitude sickness, it might provide relief relatively quickly. For glaucoma, it may take longer to see a significant reduction in pressure.
* **Can I stop taking acetazolamide suddenly?**  No, it's important to follow your doctor's instructions for stopping the medication to avoid potential complications.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms.  They may adjust your dose or recommend other treatments.
