# Acyclovir 3% w/w

**Generic Name:** Acyclovir

**Usage:** Acyclovir 3% w/w is a topical antiviral medication primarily used for the treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, specifically herpes labialis (cold sores) and genital herpes.  It's applied directly to the affected skin area.  It's important to note that the 3% w/w formulation is typically for topical use only and is not suitable for systemic infections.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Side Effects:**  While generally well-tolerated, topical acyclovir can cause mild side effects at the application site. These may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Mild itching or redness
* Dryness or scaling of the skin

Rarely, more serious allergic reactions can occur.  Stop using the medication and seek immediate medical attention if you experience:

* Severe skin reactions (e.g., rash, hives, swelling)
* Difficulty breathing
* Swelling of the face, lips, or tongue


**How it Works:** Acyclovir is a nucleoside analogue.  It works by inhibiting the viral DNA polymerase of herpes simplex viruses.  This prevents the virus from replicating and spreading, thus helping to reduce the duration and severity of the infection.  Topical application delivers the medication directly to the site of infection, leading to a localized antiviral effect.

**FAQs:**

* **Is Acyclovir 3% w/w effective for all types of herpes?** No. It is primarily effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2, which cause oral and genital herpes, respectively.  It is not effective against other viruses, such as varicella-zoster virus (which causes chickenpox and shingles).
* **How often should I apply Acyclovir 3% w/w?**  The frequency of application depends on the specific instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Generally, it's applied several times daily.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The time it takes to see improvement varies, but typically you should notice a reduction in symptoms within a few days.  However, it may take a week or longer for the infection to completely clear.
* **Can I use Acyclovir 3% w/w during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** Consult your doctor before using any medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  They can assess the risks and benefits for you and your child.
* **Can I use Acyclovir 3% w/w if I have an open wound?**  It's generally not recommended to apply the cream to open, bleeding wounds.  Always consult your doctor for advice.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Apply the medication as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't apply a double dose to make up for a missed one.
