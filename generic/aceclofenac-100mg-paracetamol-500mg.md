**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Aceclofenac + Paracetamol can cause side effects, though not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal problems:** Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (in rare cases, a severe allergic reaction).
* **Headache:** Although it can relieve headaches, it can also cause them as a side effect.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or faint.
* **Sleepiness:** Feeling unusually tired or drowsy.
* **Increased risk of bleeding:** Particularly in individuals with bleeding disorders or taking blood-thinning medications.
* **Liver damage:** In rare cases, prolonged use can cause liver damage.  Regular liver function tests might be necessary if taking this medication for an extended period.
* **Kidney problems:** In rare cases, prolonged use can affect kidney function.

**This is not an exhaustive list of side effects.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.**


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Belongs to a class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Reduces fever and provides pain relief through a different mechanism than aceclofenac.  Its exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it is thought to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects of each drug.  This results in more effective pain and inflammation relief.
