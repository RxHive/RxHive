# Aliskiren 150mg

**Generic Name:** Aliskiren

**Usage:** Aliskiren is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults. It may be used alone or with other medications to lower blood pressure.  It's specifically a renin inhibitor, meaning it works on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).  It is *not* typically recommended for use in patients with diabetes or kidney disease due to increased risk of adverse events.  Always follow your doctor's instructions and dosage recommendations.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, aliskiren can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea**
* **Nausea**
* **Vomiting**
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood):** This is a serious side effect, especially if you have kidney problems.  Symptoms can include weakness, fatigue, and irregular heartbeat.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** This can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting.
* **Cough:** Less common than with ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
* **Muscle cramps**
* **Fatigue**

Serious, but less common side effects include angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), which requires immediate medical attention.

**How it Works:** Aliskiren works by blocking the activity of renin, an enzyme that plays a key role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This system regulates blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. By inhibiting renin, aliskiren reduces the production of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict and increases blood pressure.  This ultimately leads to lower blood pressure.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take aliskiren with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins.  Aliskiren can interact with other medications, particularly those that affect kidney function or potassium levels (e.g., potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs).  Combining aliskiren with an ACE inhibitor or ARB is generally discouraged due to increased risk of kidney problems and hyperkalemia.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking aliskiren?** A:  Alcohol can lower blood pressure, and combining it with aliskiren may lead to excessive blood pressure lowering (hypotension).  Limit alcohol consumption while taking aliskiren, or as advised by your doctor.

* **Q: What are the signs of an allergic reaction?** A: Signs of an allergic reaction can include rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, or tightness in the chest.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms.

* **Q:  Is aliskiren safe for pregnant women?** A:  No, aliskiren is not safe for pregnant women or women who are planning to become pregnant.  It can cause serious harm to the developing fetus.
