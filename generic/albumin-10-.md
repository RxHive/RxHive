# Albumin 10%

**Generic Name:** Albumin (Human) 10%

**Usage:**  Albumin 10% solution is used to treat hypovolemic shock (low blood volume causing dangerously low blood pressure), and to replace protein lost due to various conditions. These conditions include burns, surgery, trauma, kidney disease, and liver disease. It can also be used during and after major surgeries to maintain blood volume and support blood pressure.  Its use is largely supportive, not curative.  It's administered intravenously.

**Side Effects:** Side effects are generally rare but can include:

* **Fever:** A relatively common reaction.
* **Chills:** Often accompanying fever.
* **Nausea and Vomiting:** Less common.
* **Headache:** Infrequent.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** Though paradoxical, rapid administration can sometimes cause this.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but potentially serious, ranging from mild rash to anaphylaxis (life-threatening allergic reaction). This is why careful monitoring is crucial during administration.
* **Fluid overload:** Can occur if given too rapidly or in excessive amounts, leading to edema (swelling).
* **Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein):** Can occur at the injection site.


**How it Works:** Albumin is a protein naturally found in the blood.  The 10% solution increases blood volume and blood pressure by expanding the plasma volume (the liquid component of blood). This helps maintain adequate tissue perfusion (blood flow to tissues) and improves organ function.  It also contributes to maintaining the osmotic pressure of the blood, preventing fluid from leaking out of the blood vessels.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Albumin 10% safe?**  Generally, it's safe when administered properly under medical supervision. However, allergic reactions and fluid overload are possible.
* **How is it administered?** It's given intravenously (IV) by healthcare professionals. The rate of administration is crucial and carefully controlled.
* **What are the contraindications?**  Individuals with severe heart failure, severe anemia, or known allergy to albumin should generally not receive it.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss its use with their doctor.
* **How long does it take to work?** The effects are usually seen relatively quickly after administration, helping to restore blood volume and pressure.
* **Are there any drug interactions?** While relatively few direct interactions exist, its use should be carefully considered in patients already receiving other intravenous fluids or medications to prevent fluid overload.
* **Is it a blood product?** While derived from human plasma, it undergoes processing that reduces the risk of transmitting infectious agents, though residual risk always remains.
* **Can I get Albumin 10% over the counter?** No, it's a prescription medication requiring administration by a healthcare professional.
