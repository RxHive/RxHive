# Aceclofenac 100mg + Diacerein 50mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Diacerein 50mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease).  Aceclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), reduces pain and inflammation. Diacerein, a chondroprotective agent, may help slow the progression of cartilage damage in osteoarthritis.  It is typically prescribed for short-term use to manage symptoms and should only be taken as directed by a doctor.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Aceclofenac 100mg + Diacerein 50mg can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, ulcers (rare but serious).
* **Skin:** Rash, itching, hives.
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness.
* **Liver:**  Elevated liver enzymes (rare but serious).
* **Kidney:**  Fluid retention, changes in kidney function (rare but serious).

More serious, though rare, side effects include allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), and cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke).  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**  This list is not exhaustive, and other side effects may occur.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list and to discuss any concerns.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause inflammation and pain.
* **Diacerein:**  The exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to influence the production of cytokines involved in inflammation and cartilage degradation.  It may also have anti-inflammatory properties and potentially stimulate the repair of cartilage.
