**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 50mg + Paracetamol 125mg/5ml  (This is a combination drug, so both names are listed)

* Menstrual cramps
* Post-surgical pain

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary depending on individual factors. Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system, reducing fever and pain.

The combination of aceclofenac and paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects of each drug. This allows for effective pain and fever relief at lower doses of each component, potentially reducing the risk of side effects.
