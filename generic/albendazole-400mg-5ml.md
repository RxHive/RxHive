# Albendazole 400mg/5ml

**Generic Name:** Albendazole

**Usage:** Albendazole 400mg/5ml oral suspension is an anthelmintic (antiworm) medication used to treat various parasitic worm infections, including:

* **Nematodes:**  Roundworms such as *Ascaris lumbricoides*, *Trichuris trichiura*, *Enterobius vermicularis* (pinworms), and hookworms (*Necator americanus* and *Ancylostoma duodenale*).
* **Cestodes:** Tapeworms such as *Taenia saginata*, *Taenia solium*, and *Hymenolepis nana*.
* **Trematodes:** Certain types of flukes (depending on the specific species and infection).  This usually requires higher doses or longer treatment courses.

The specific usage and dosage will depend on the type of infection, the patient's age and weight, and the severity of the infection.  **Always follow the prescription instructions provided by a doctor.**  This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.


**Side Effects:**  Common side effects of Albendazole include:

* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash
* Fever

More serious, though rare, side effects can include:

* Liver problems (jaundice, elevated liver enzymes)
* Blood disorders (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)
* Neurotoxicity (rare, usually associated with high doses or pre-existing conditions)


**How it Works:** Albendazole interferes with the glucose uptake and microtubule formation in parasitic worms. This disrupts their metabolism and ultimately leads to their death and expulsion from the body.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take Albendazole without a prescription?** A: No. Albendazole should only be used under the supervision of a healthcare professional who can diagnose the infection and determine the appropriate dosage and treatment duration.  Incorrect use can be ineffective and potentially harmful.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist for instructions. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?** A: Yes, Albendazole can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting Albendazole treatment.  Certain medications can affect the metabolism of Albendazole, potentially reducing its effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.

* **Q: Is Albendazole safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** A:  Albendazole should generally be avoided during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Consult your doctor about the risks and benefits.  The use during breastfeeding should also be discussed with a doctor.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effectiveness of Albendazole varies depending on the type of parasite and the severity of the infection.  You may not see immediate results, and follow-up stool examinations may be necessary to confirm the eradication of the parasites.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects often resolve on their own.  However, if you experience severe or persistent side effects, contact your doctor immediately.
