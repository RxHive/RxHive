# Aceclofenac 100mg  + Paracetamol 325mg  + Chlorzoxazone 15mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac + Paracetamol + Chlorzoxazone

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders such as:

* **Osteoarthritis:** Pain and stiffness in joints.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis:** Inflammatory joint pain.
* **Sprains and strains:** Soft tissue injuries causing pain and inflammation.
* **Back pain:**  Pain stemming from muscle strains or other back problems.
* **Post-surgical pain:** Pain after surgery, particularly involving musculoskeletal systems.

**It's crucial to understand that this medication is for short-term use only and should only be taken as prescribed by a doctor.**  It is not a cure for these conditions but provides symptomatic relief.

**Side Effects:** Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency, but some common ones include:

* **Gastrointestinal problems:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn, indigestion, constipation, abdominal pain, ulceration (rare but serious).
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling (especially of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.
* **Central nervous system effects:** Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, confusion.
* **Liver problems:**  Rare, but possible, especially with long-term use.  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) or dark urine.
* **Kidney problems:**  Rare, but possible, especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Increased bleeding risk:** Especially if taken with other medications that affect blood clotting.

This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects are possible.  Always consult the medication's package insert or your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list.

**How it Works:** This combination drug works through the combined action of its three components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, substances that contribute to pain and swelling.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs, likely involving the central nervous system.
* **Chlorzoxazone:** A muscle relaxant that helps to relieve muscle spasms and pain by acting on the central nervous system.
