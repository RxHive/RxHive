# Aceclofenac 100mg + Thiocolchicoside 8mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Thiocolchicoside 8mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and a muscle relaxant used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Acute musculoskeletal pain (e.g., back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain)
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic pain and inflammation


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but can include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, indigestion, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, rash.
* **Less Common:**  Heartburn, bloating, flatulence, altered taste, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), insomnia.
* **Rare but Serious:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers, liver damage, kidney problems, heart problems (increased blood pressure, fluid retention, heart failure), increased risk of stroke or heart attack (especially with prolonged use).

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This NSAID works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Thiocolchicoside:** This muscle relaxant works by decreasing muscle spasms and stiffness, providing relief from pain related to muscle tension.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's thought to act on the central and peripheral nervous systems.

The combination of aceclofenac and thiocolchicoside provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects of each drug. This leads to better pain relief and reduced inflammation in musculoskeletal conditions.
