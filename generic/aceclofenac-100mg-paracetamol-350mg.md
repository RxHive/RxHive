# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 350mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 350mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation (swelling) caused by various conditions such as:

* Osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease)
* Rheumatoid arthritis (inflammatory joint disease)
* Ankylosing spondylitis (inflammatory spinal disease)
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic pain
* Other types of musculoskeletal pain and inflammation

**Important Note:**  This medication is a symptomatic treatment; it does not cure the underlying condition.  It should be used as directed by a doctor and only for the duration prescribed.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, aceclofenac + paracetamol can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Indigestion
* Constipation
* Skin rash
* Swelling of ankles or feet (edema)


**Serious but less common side effects require immediate medical attention and include:**

* Changes in hearing or vision
* Unusual bruising or bleeding


The frequency and severity of side effects can vary depending on individual factors such as age, overall health, and other medications being taken.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Belongs to a class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever and provides mild to moderate pain relief through a mechanism that is not fully understood, but it is believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.

The combination of aceclofenac and paracetamol provides a broader range of pain relief and anti-inflammatory action than either drug alone.
