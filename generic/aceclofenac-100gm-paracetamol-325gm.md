# Aceclofenac 100gm + Paracetamol 325gm

It's crucial to understand that providing detailed medical information, including side effects and how a drug works, is beyond the scope of my capabilities as an AI.  I am not a medical professional.  The information below is for general knowledge only and should **not** be considered medical advice.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication.


**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac + Paracetamol (This combination is not standardized across all regions; the specific proportions may vary slightly).


**Usage:**  This combination is commonly used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic pain
* Mild to moderate pain


**Side Effects:**  Possible side effects can vary widely depending on individual factors and may include (but are not limited to):

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, indigestion, ulceration (rare but serious)

* **Kidney problems:**  Reduced kidney function (rare but serious)
* **Other:**  Fluid retention, changes in blood pressure


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).  Its exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work by affecting the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.  The combination allows for a broader approach to pain management.
