# Aliskiren 150mg + Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg

**Generic Name:** Aliskiren 150mg + Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by combining two different types of blood pressure-lowering drugs to achieve better control than either drug alone. Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor, and hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic.  This combination is typically prescribed when other blood pressure medications haven't been effective enough on their own.  **It's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions precisely regarding dosage and administration.**


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Some common side effects include:

* **Dizziness:** This can be particularly noticeable when standing up suddenly (orthostatic hypotension).
* **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired or weak.
* **Headache:** Frequent or severe headaches.
* **Cough:** A persistent dry cough.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to your stomach.
* **Diarrhea or constipation:** Changes in bowel habits.
* **Muscle cramps:** Pain or spasms in muscles.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (seek immediate medical attention if this occurs).
* **Increased blood sugar:** Especially relevant for individuals with diabetes.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:** This can affect heart rhythm and other bodily functions.

This list is not exhaustive, and more serious side effects are possible.  **It's essential to consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.**


**How it Works:**

* **Aliskiren:** Renin is an enzyme crucial in the body's system for regulating blood pressure.  Aliskiren directly inhibits renin, thus reducing the production of angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor (a substance that narrows blood vessels). This leads to lower blood pressure.
* **Hydrochlorothiazide:** This is a diuretic (water pill) that increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the urine. By reducing fluid volume in the bloodstream, it helps lower blood pressure.

The combination of these two medications provides a synergistic effect, meaning they work together more effectively than either would alone to lower blood pressure.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take this medication with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies.  Interactions can occur.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double up on doses.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** Alcohol can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of side effects.  Limit alcohol consumption or avoid it altogether while on this medication.
* **Can I become pregnant while taking this medication?**  This medication is not recommended during pregnancy.  Discuss contraception options with your doctor.
* **How long will it take to see results?** It may take several weeks to see the full effects of the medication.  Regular blood pressure monitoring is essential.
* **What should I do if my blood pressure is too low?**  Symptoms of low blood pressure include dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting.  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms.
