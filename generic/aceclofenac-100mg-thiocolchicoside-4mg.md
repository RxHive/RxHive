# Aceclofenac 100mg + Thiocolchicoside 4mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Thiocolchicoside 4mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders, such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Acute musculoskeletal pain (e.g., back pain, sprains, strains)

It's crucial to understand that this medication only treats the *symptoms* of these conditions, not the underlying causes.  It should be used as directed by a doctor and not for self-medication. The duration of treatment should be as short as possible to minimize side effects.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Aceclofenac 100mg + Thiocolchicoside 4mg can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  These can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, heartburn, constipation, indigestion,  ulcers (rare but serious), bleeding (rare but serious).
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Skin:** Rash, itching.
* **Other:** Swelling in the ankles and feet (edema), increased liver enzymes (detected through blood tests), allergic reactions (rare but potentially serious).

**Serious side effects, though rare, require immediate medical attention.  These include:**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Severe gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Liver damage
* Kidney problems

This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult the patient information leaflet provided with your medication or your doctor or pharmacist for complete details.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.

* **Thiocolchicoside:** This is a muscle relaxant. It works by reducing muscle spasms and stiffness, thereby relieving pain associated with muscle tension.

The combination of aceclofenac and thiocolchicoside provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects.  This improves pain relief and reduces inflammation.
