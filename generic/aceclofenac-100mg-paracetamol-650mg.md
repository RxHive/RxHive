**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 650mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

* **Osteoarthritis:** Pain and inflammation in joints due to cartilage breakdown.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis:** A chronic inflammatory disorder affecting joints.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis:** Inflammation of the spine.

* **Menstrual cramps:** Painful menstruation.
* **Other types of moderate to severe pain:**  Headache, muscle pain, back pain (when inflammation is present).

**Important Note:** This medication is not suitable for all types of pain.  It's crucial to consult a doctor to determine if this combination is appropriate for your specific condition and pain level.  It should not be used for long-term pain management without a doctor's supervision.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person, and some may be more common or severe than others.  Possible side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, indigestion, ulcers (rare but serious).
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Skin:** Rash, itching, hives.
* **Liver:**  Rare cases of liver damage (monitor for signs like jaundice, dark urine, pale stools).
* **Kidney:**  Rare cases of kidney problems (monitor for changes in urination).
* **Allergic reactions:**  In rare cases, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, or a rapid heartbeat.


**How it Works:**

This combination drug works through two different mechanisms:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** A pain reliever and fever reducer. Its exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system, thereby reducing pain signals.

The combination provides a synergistic effect, meaning the pain relief is greater than the sum of each drug's individual effect.
