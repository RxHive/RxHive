**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 125mg can cause side effects, though not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn, abdominal pain, indigestion.
* **Headache:** While it can treat headache, it can also be a side effect.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or faint.
* **Sleepiness:** Feeling drowsy or tired.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (rare but serious).

**Less common but more serious side effects** require immediate medical attention and include:

* **Liver damage:** Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine.
* **Kidney problems:** Changes in urination, swelling in legs and ankles.
* **Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction):** Difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Belongs to a class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever and provides mild to moderate pain relief through a mechanism not fully understood, but believed to involve inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol offers a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects, leading to more effective pain and inflammation relief.
