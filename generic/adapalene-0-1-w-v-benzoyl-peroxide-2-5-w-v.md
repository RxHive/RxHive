# Adapalene 0.1% w/v + Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5% w/v

**Generic Name:** Adapalene/Benzoyl Peroxide topical gel/cream

**Usage:**

This combination medication is used to treat acne vulgaris (acne). Adapalene is a retinoid that helps unclog pores and prevents the formation of new pimples. Benzoyl peroxide kills acne-causing bacteria and also helps to unclog pores.  It is applied topically (directly to the skin) once daily, usually at night, to affected areas.  Follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist carefully.  Start with a small amount and gradually increase as tolerated to avoid irritation.  It's crucial to cleanse the skin gently before application.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Skin irritation:** This is the most common side effect and can manifest as redness, dryness, peeling, burning, stinging, or itching.  This is often temporary and reduces with continued use or by reducing application frequency.
* **Increased sun sensitivity:**  The skin becomes more sensitive to sunlight, increasing the risk of sunburn.  Always use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher during the day, even on cloudy days.
* **Discoloration of the skin:**  In some cases, particularly in individuals with darker skin tones, hyperpigmentation (darkening) or hypopigmentation (lightening) can occur. This is usually temporary, but it's important to consult a doctor if it's concerning.


Less common but more serious side effects that require immediate medical attention include:

* Severe allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling)
* Significant skin blistering or peeling


**How it Works:**

Adapalene and benzoyl peroxide work synergistically (together) to treat acne.

* **Adapalene:**  It's a retinoid that works by regulating the turnover of skin cells. This helps prevent the formation of comedones (blocked pores), reducing the number of pimples. It also reduces inflammation.

* **Benzoyl Peroxide:** This is an antimicrobial agent that kills *Cutibacterium acnes* (formerly *Propionibacterium acnes*), a bacteria that plays a significant role in the development of acne. It also helps to unclog pores by reducing the stickiness of sebum (oil).


The combination of these two active ingredients provides a broader approach to acne treatment compared to using either one alone.

Using multiple topical acne medications simultaneously can increase the risk of irritation.  Your doctor might recommend starting with only this combination and adding other treatments as needed.

* **How long does it take to work?**  You may not see significant results for several weeks, and consistent use is essential.  Be patient and continue using the medication as directed.

* **Can I use this during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Can I use this on my face, body, or both?** Follow your doctor's instructions on the specific area(s) to treat.

* **What if I miss a dose?** Apply the medication as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **How should I store this medication?** Store at room temperature, away from heat and light.  Keep out of reach of children.
