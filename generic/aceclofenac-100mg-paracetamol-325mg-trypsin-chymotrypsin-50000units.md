# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 50000units

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 50000 units

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various musculoskeletal conditions, such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic inflammation and pain (e.g., sprains, strains)
* Soft tissue injuries

It's important to note that this is not a first-line treatment for these conditions and should only be used as directed by a physician.  The specific duration and dosage will depend on individual needs and the severity of symptoms.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* Gastrointestinal issues:  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, ulceration (rare but serious)
* Allergic reactions: Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (seek immediate medical attention if this occurs)
* Central nervous system effects: Dizziness, headache, drowsiness
* Liver problems:  Rare, but possible, especially with long-term use. Liver function tests may be necessary.
* Kidney problems: Rare, but possible, especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney disease.
* Increased bleeding risk (due to the anti-inflammatory effects)


**How it Works:** This combination medication works through multiple mechanisms:

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals involved in the inflammatory process.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic and antipyretic (fever reducer) that works centrally in the brain to reduce pain and fever.  The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's thought to involve inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes in the central nervous system.
* **Trypsin Chymotrypsin:** Proteolytic enzymes that help break down proteins involved in inflammation and swelling. They may help reduce edema (swelling) and improve tissue repair.  However, the evidence supporting their efficacy in combination with NSAIDs and Paracetamol is limited and debated.
