# Acetylcysteine 300mg + Ambroxol 30mg

**Generic Name:**  Acetylcysteine 300mg + Ambroxol 30mg  (This is a combination drug, so there isn't one single generic name besides specifying both components)


**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat productive coughs (coughs that produce mucus) associated with respiratory tract infections like bronchitis and pneumonia.  Acetylcysteine helps to thin and loosen the mucus, making it easier to cough up. Ambroxol assists in further breaking down the mucus and improves its expulsion.  It is usually prescribed for short-term use.  *Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and duration of treatment.*


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual.  Common side effects may include:

* **Acetylcysteine:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, bad breath (garlic-like odor), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), rarely severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).
* **Ambroxol:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, dry mouth.  Rarely, more serious side effects such as skin reactions or liver problems can occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Acetylcysteine:**  Is a mucolytic agent. It breaks down the disulfide bonds in mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expectorate (cough up).  It works by chemically altering the structure of the mucus.

* **Ambroxol:** Is an expectorant. It increases the secretion of fluid in the respiratory tract, helping to further dilute and liquefy the mucus, making it easier to cough up. It also has some mild effects on the cilia (tiny hairs in the airways that move mucus) to improve their function.
