# Adefovir 10mg

**Generic Name:** Adefovir Dipivoxil

**Usage:**

Adefovir dipivoxil is an antiviral medication used to treat chronic hepatitis B infection in adults.  It's not a cure for hepatitis B, but it can help to reduce the amount of the virus in the body (viral load), improve liver function, and slow the progression of liver disease. It is typically used in combination with other antiviral medications in certain cases. The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a doctor based on individual patient factors.  It's important to note that Adefovir dipivoxil is *not* effective against hepatitis C or other viral infections.

**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, adefovir dipivoxil can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** A relatively frequent side effect.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or lacking energy.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Abdominal pain:** Pain in the stomach area.
* **Back pain:** Pain in the back.
* **Muscle pain:**  Pain or aches in the muscles.

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* **Kidney problems:**  Adefovir can affect kidney function, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney disease. Regular blood tests to monitor kidney function are essential.
* **Bone problems:**  Long-term use may be associated with decreased bone mineral density and increased risk of fractures.
* **Liver problems:** Although used to treat liver disease, adefovir can, in rare cases, worsen liver problems.
* **Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas):** This is a rare but serious side effect.
* **Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction):** This is a rare but life-threatening reaction.


**How it Works:**

Adefovir dipivoxil is a nucleotide analog that inhibits the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA polymerase. This enzyme is essential for the HBV to replicate itself. By inhibiting this enzyme, adefovir dipivoxil reduces the amount of HBV in the body, leading to improved liver function and slowing the progression of liver damage.  It works by incorporating itself into the growing DNA chain of the virus, thus terminating its replication.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I stop taking Adefovir dipivoxil when I feel better?** A: No.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to the virus rebounding and potentially causing more liver damage.  Your doctor will determine when and how to stop treatment.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Adefovir dipivoxil?** A:  Alcohol can worsen liver damage, so it's generally recommended to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while on this medication.  Discuss this with your doctor.

* **Q: Does Adefovir dipivoxil interact with other medications?** A: Yes, it can.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.

* **Q: Are there generic versions of Adefovir dipivoxil available?** A: Yes, generic versions are widely available.
