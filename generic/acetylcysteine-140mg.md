# Acetylcysteine 140mg

**Generic Name:** Acetylcysteine

**Usage:**

Acetylcysteine 140mg is primarily used to thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.  Its main uses include:

* **Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations:**  Helps clear mucus buildup during COPD flare-ups.
* **Treatment of acute bronchitis:**  Assists in loosening and expectorating mucus in the bronchi.
* **Cystic fibrosis:**  Helps to manage mucus buildup in the lungs.
* **Paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose:**  This is a crucial use, where acetylcysteine acts as an antidote by preventing liver damage.  The dosage for this use is significantly higher than 140mg and requires strict medical supervision.  A 140mg dose is insufficient for this purpose.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary but are generally mild.  They may include:

* **Nausea:**  A common side effect, potentially mitigated by taking the medication with food.
* **Vomiting:** Less common than nausea.
* **Diarrhea:**  In some cases.
* **Stomach upset:**  Including abdominal pain or discomfort.
* **Mouth sores:**  Less frequent.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but possible, including rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.
* **Bronchospasm:**  Particularly important for individuals with asthma or other respiratory conditions, requiring close monitoring.  This is a serious side effect.

**How it Works:**

Acetylcysteine is a mucolytic agent.  It works by breaking down disulfide bonds within mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel from the airways. In the case of paracetamol overdose, it works differently, acting as a precursor to glutathione, which helps neutralize the toxic metabolite of paracetamol.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take acetylcysteine 140mg without a doctor's prescription?**  A: In many regions, this might be available over-the-counter for certain conditions (e.g., cough), but it's crucial to consult a doctor or pharmacist before using it, especially if you have underlying health conditions like asthma or liver problems.  A prescription is always required for paracetamol overdose treatment.
* **Q: How should I take acetylcysteine 140mg?** A: Follow the instructions on the medication label or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.  This usually involves taking it with water and potentially food to reduce nausea.

* **Q: Can I take acetylcysteine 140mg with other medications?** A:  It's essential to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to avoid potential drug interactions.
