**How it Works:** This combination drug works through a synergistic effect of its three components:

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** A pain reliever and fever reducer that works differently than NSAIDs, its exact mechanism isn't fully understood but is thought to affect prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system.
* **Chlorzoxazone:** A muscle relaxant that helps relieve muscle spasms and pain by affecting the central nervous system.  The exact mechanism is not completely understood but is believed to influence nerve impulses to skeletal muscles.
