# Aceclofenac 25mg + Paracetamol 125mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 25mg + Paracetamol 125mg (This is a combination drug, so both names are listed)

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve mild to moderate pain and inflammation.  It's often prescribed for conditions like:

* Headaches
* Toothaches
* Muscle aches
* Back pain
* Menstrual cramps
* Post-surgical pain
* Pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Aceclofenac + Paracetamol can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Indigestion
* Stomach pain
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Skin rash

More serious, but less common, side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (such as swelling of the face, lips, or throat)
* Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine)
* Kidney problems
* Severe stomach pain or bleeding (black or bloody stools)
* Blood disorders (unusual bruising or bleeding)


**How it Works:** This combination drug works through two different mechanisms:

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to pain and swelling.

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).  Its exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's thought to affect prostaglandin production in the central nervous system, thus reducing fever and pain perception.  The combination enhances pain relief by utilizing two different pain-reducing pathways.
