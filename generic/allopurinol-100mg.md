# Allopurinol 100mg

**Generic Name:** Allopurinol

**Usage:**

Allopurinol is used to treat and prevent gout attacks.  It works by reducing the amount of uric acid in the blood.  High levels of uric acid can lead to gout attacks, kidney stones, and other health problems.  It's also used to treat or prevent uric acid kidney stones and tumor lysis syndrome (a complication of cancer treatment).  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage and duration of treatment based on individual needs.  It's crucial to follow prescribed dosage instructions carefully.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Skin rash:** This is the most common side effect and can range from mild to severe.  Severe reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a serious skin reaction), can occur, although this is rare.  Stop taking allopurinol and seek immediate medical attention if you develop a rash.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are less common side effects.
* **Diarrhea:**  This is another possible side effect.
* **Headache:** This is a relatively mild side effect.
* **Dizziness:**  Less common.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Liver problems:**  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, and abdominal pain.
* **Kidney problems:**  Seek medical attention immediately if you experience changes in urination or swelling.
* **Blood disorders:**  This is rare but serious.


**How it Works:**

Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, an enzyme in the body that is involved in the production of uric acid. By blocking this enzyme, allopurinol reduces the production of uric acid, allowing the body to excrete excess uric acid more effectively, thus lowering serum uric acid levels.  This helps prevent future gout attacks and reduces the risk of uric acid kidney stones.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking allopurinol?**  It's generally recommended to limit alcohol consumption while taking allopurinol, as alcohol can increase the risk of gout attacks.  Consult your doctor.
* **How long does it take to work?**  It may take several weeks or months for allopurinol to reach its full effect in lowering uric acid levels.  You might still experience gout attacks during this period.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
* **Can I take allopurinol with other medications?**  Allopurinol can interact with other medications.  It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?**  Signs of an allergic reaction can include rash, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms.
* **Should I change my diet while taking allopurinol?**  A low-purine diet may help to further reduce uric acid levels.  Your doctor or a registered dietitian can provide advice on appropriate dietary changes.
