# Aceclofenac 100mg + Zinc Carnosine 37.5mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Zinc Carnosine 37.5mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions.  Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation. Zinc carnosine is an antioxidant and has been suggested to have a protective effect on cartilage.  The combination aims to provide both pain relief and potential cartilage protection.  **It's crucial to note that the efficacy of zinc carnosine in treating osteoarthritis is still under investigation and not definitively established.** The specific usage should always be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and medical history.

**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity.  Common side effects associated with aceclofenac include:

* Gastrointestinal issues:  Heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, peptic ulcers (rare but serious).
*  Headache
* Dizziness
* Skin rash
* Swelling in the ankles and feet (edema)

Side effects associated with zinc carnosine are generally considered mild and less frequent, but may include nausea, diarrhea or metallic taste.

**Serious side effects, though rare, are possible and require immediate medical attention.  These include:**

* Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing)
* Severe gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Liver damage
* Kidney problems
* Heart problems (increased risk of heart attack or stroke - this risk is associated with NSAIDs in general)

This list is not exhaustive.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This NSAID works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, aceclofenac helps to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation in joints.

* **Zinc Carnosine:** The mechanism of action of zinc carnosine in osteoarthritis is not fully understood.  It's believed to act as an antioxidant, potentially protecting cartilage from damage caused by free radicals.  It may also have anti-inflammatory properties. However, further research is needed to confirm these effects and establish its effectiveness in treating osteoarthritis.
