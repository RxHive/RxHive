# Adapalene 0.10% w/w + Clindamycin 1% w/w

**Generic Name:** Adapalene 0.10% w/w + Clindamycin 1% w/w

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical treatment for acne vulgaris (acne).  It's used to treat inflammatory acne lesions (papules and pustules) and comedones (blackheads and whiteheads).  The adapalene helps prevent the formation of new comedones, while the clindamycin treats existing inflammatory lesions by killing acne-causing bacteria. It is typically applied once daily, usually in the evening, to affected areas of the skin after cleansing.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Skin irritation:**  Burning, stinging, redness, dryness, peeling, and itching at the application site are common, especially initially. These typically lessen with continued use.
* **Increased sun sensitivity:**  The skin may become more sensitive to sunlight, increasing the risk of sunburn.  Use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher during the day.
* **Dryness:** This can be managed by using a moisturizer.
* **Erythema (redness):**
* **Scaling:**
* **Burning/stinging:**
* **Rare but serious:**  Some individuals may experience an allergic reaction (rare).  Stop use and seek medical attention if you experience significant swelling, difficulty breathing, or other allergic symptoms.


**How it Works:**

* **Adapalene:** This is a retinoid, a derivative of vitamin A. It works by:
    * Unblocking pores (comedones) by increasing skin cell turnover. This helps prevent the formation of new comedones.
    * Reducing inflammation.

* **Clindamycin:** This is an antibiotic that works by:
    * Killing the bacteria *Cutibacterium acnes* (formerly known as *Propionibacterium acnes*), a major contributor to acne inflammation.


The combination of adapalene and clindamycin provides a synergistic effect, targeting both the formation of comedones and the bacterial infection responsible for acne inflammation.
