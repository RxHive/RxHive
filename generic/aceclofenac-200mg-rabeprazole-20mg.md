# Aceclofenac 200mg + Rabeprazole 20mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 200mg + Rabeprazole 20mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation, while rabeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces stomach acid production.  The rabeprazole is included to help protect the stomach lining from the potential ulcer-causing effects of aceclofenac.  It is crucial to use this medication exactly as prescribed by a doctor.  It's not suitable for self-medication.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **From Aceclofenac:** Headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, gas,  increased risk of bleeding (especially in the stomach or intestines), fluid retention, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), increased blood pressure, ringing in the ears (tinnitus).  In rare cases, more serious side effects like liver or kidney problems, heart failure, and severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) can occur.

* **From Rabeprazole:** Headache, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, dizziness.  Less common but potentially serious side effects include:  bone fractures, vitamin B12 deficiency,  kidney problems, infections (like *Clostridium difficile*), and an increased risk of *Salmonella* and *Campylobacter* infections.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This NSAID works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain and inflammation.  By reducing prostaglandin production, aceclofenac alleviates pain and reduces swelling in the joints.

* **Rabeprazole:** This PPI works by reducing the amount of stomach acid produced.  It does this by blocking the "proton pump" in the cells lining the stomach.  By decreasing stomach acid, it protects the stomach lining from the damaging effects of aceclofenac, which can irritate the stomach and increase the risk of ulcers and bleeding.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long should I take this medication?** A:  The duration of treatment depends on your individual condition and response to the medication.  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully and do not stop taking the medication without consulting them.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: It's generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking this medication, as it can increase the risk of stomach upset and bleeding.  Discuss this with your doctor.

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other drugs?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some medications can interact with aceclofenac or rabeprazole.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe allergic reactions (difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or throat), severe stomach pain, black or bloody stools, persistent vomiting, or any other unusual or worsening symptoms.
