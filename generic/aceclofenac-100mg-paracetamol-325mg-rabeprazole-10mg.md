# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Rabeprazole 10mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Rabeprazole 10mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Other musculoskeletal disorders
* Post-operative pain
* Moderate to severe pain

The combination offers a multi-pronged approach: Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provide pain relief and reduce inflammation, while Rabeprazole protects the stomach lining from the potential ulcer-causing effects of Aceclofenac (a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug or NSAID).  It is crucial to use this medication as prescribed by a doctor and only for the indicated conditions.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, indigestion, heartburn (even with Rabeprazole, some gastrointestinal issues are still possible).
* **Central Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness.
* **Skin:** Rash, itching.
* **Other:**  Fluid retention, increased blood pressure.
* **Rare but serious:**  Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), liver problems, kidney problems, ulcers, bleeding in the stomach or intestines.

This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult the medication's package insert or your doctor for a complete list of potential side effects.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** A NSAID that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever and provides mild to moderate pain relief through a mechanism not fully understood but thought to involve inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system.
* **Rabeprazole:** A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces stomach acid production. This helps protect the stomach lining from the damaging effects of Aceclofenac, which can irritate the stomach and increase the risk of ulcers and bleeding.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: It is generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking this medication, as alcohol can increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
