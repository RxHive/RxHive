**Important Note:**  This information is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice.  The specific uses and dosage should always be determined by a qualified healthcare professional. Self-medication is strongly discouraged.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person, but some common ones associated with the individual components include:

* **Aceclofenac:**  Gastrointestinal issues (indigestion, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, stomach ulcers), dizziness, headache, allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, swelling), increased risk of bleeding, fluid retention.  Rare but serious side effects include liver and kidney damage.
* **Paracetamol:**  Rarely, allergic reactions, liver damage (especially with overdose), low blood cell counts.
* **Trypsin Chymotrypsin:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), nausea, vomiting.


This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity of side effects can range from mild to severe.  If you experience any concerning side effects, discontinue use and consult a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever and provides mild to moderate pain relief through a mechanism that is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve the central nervous system.
* **Trypsin Chymotrypsin:**  These are proteolytic enzymes that help break down proteins involved in inflammation and swelling.  They may aid in reducing edema and improving tissue healing.


The combination of these three ingredients aims to provide a multi-faceted approach to pain and inflammation management, combining analgesic (pain-relieving), anti-inflammatory, and proteolytic effects.
