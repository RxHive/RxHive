# Alcaftadine 2.5mg/ml

**Generic Name:** Alcaftadine

**Usage:** Alcaftadine 2.5mg/ml is an ophthalmic solution (eye drops) used to treat allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye).  It's specifically used to relieve the symptoms of this allergy, such as itching, redness, and swelling.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, alcaftadine can cause side effects, though not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye(s) upon application.
* Eye dryness.
* Blurred vision (temporary).
* Headache.
* Bad taste in the mouth.

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:

* Severe eye pain.
* Vision changes beyond temporary blurring.
* Signs of infection (increased redness, pus).
* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing).

This is not an exhaustive list, and the frequency and severity of side effects can vary.  Consult the patient information leaflet provided with your medication or your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list.


**How it Works:** Alcaftadine is a type of medication called a histamine H1 receptor antagonist.  Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. It causes the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.  Alcaftadine works by blocking the action of histamine on its receptors, thus preventing or reducing the allergic symptoms in the eye.
