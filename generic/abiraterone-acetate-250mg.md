# Abiraterone Acetate 250mg

**Generic Name:** Abiraterone Acetate

**Usage:**

Abiraterone acetate is a medication used to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer or mCRPC). It's typically used in combination with prednisone or prednisolone (corticosteroids).  It's specifically used for men whose cancer has progressed after treatment with docetaxel chemotherapy.  It may also be used in earlier stages of mCRPC in certain situations, as determined by a physician.  It is not a first-line treatment for prostate cancer.


**Side Effects:**

Abiraterone acetate can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Fluid retention (edema):** Swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet.
* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  Requires monitoring and may need medication adjustment.
* **Low potassium (hypokalemia):** Can lead to heart rhythm problems.
* **Increased cholesterol and triglycerides:** Requires monitoring and lifestyle changes.
* **Hot flashes:** Feeling of warmth spreading over the body.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Diarrhea or constipation:** Changes in bowel habits.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Muscle pain or weakness:** Myalgia.

Serious side effects, although less common, include:

* **Heart problems:** Irregular heartbeat, heart failure.
* **Liver problems:**  Liver damage (hepatotoxicity).
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Severe imbalances of sodium, potassium, and other electrolytes.
* **Increased risk of infection:** Due to suppressed immune system.
* **Adrenal insufficiency:**  Insufficient production of cortisol by the adrenal glands.


**How it Works:**

Abiraterone acetate is a CYP17 inhibitor.  It blocks the enzyme CYP17, which is involved in the production of androgens (male hormones) in the body.  Androgens fuel the growth of many prostate cancers. By inhibiting the production of androgens, abiraterone acetate helps to slow or stop the growth of prostate cancer cells.  The concurrent use of prednisone/prednisolone helps to manage some of the side effects associated with the lowered androgen levels.
