**Important Note:**  This information is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice. Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting any medication, including this combination drug.  The specific usage and dosage will depend on your individual condition and your doctor's assessment.  Self-treating can be dangerous.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain

**How it Works:** This combination drug works through a synergistic effect of its three components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs. The exact mechanism of action is still unclear, but it is thought to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.
* **Chlorzoxazone:** A muscle relaxant that helps to reduce muscle spasms and pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders.  It's believed to act on the central nervous system to reduce muscle spasticity.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  It's generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking this combination, as it can increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects and interact negatively with the medication's effects.
* **Can I take this medication long-term?** Long-term use should only be undertaken under strict medical supervision due to the potential for serious side effects, particularly on the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys.
