Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and inflammation caused by various conditions, including:

* Osteoarthritis:  Pain and inflammation in the joints.
* Rheumatoid arthritis:  A chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints.

**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, aceclofenac can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* Gastrointestinal problems:  Heartburn, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, ulceration (rare but serious).
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Sleep disturbances
* Skin rash
* Swelling in the ankles, feet, or legs (fluid retention)


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)

* Increased risk of bleeding (especially in individuals with bleeding disorders or taking blood thinners)
* Cardiovascular problems (increased risk of heart attack or stroke, particularly with long-term use or high doses)


**How it Works:**

Aceclofenac works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.  By reducing prostaglandin levels, aceclofenac helps to relieve pain and inflammation.
