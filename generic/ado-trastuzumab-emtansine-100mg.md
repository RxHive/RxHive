# Ado-trastuzumab emtansine 100mg

**Generic Name:** Ado-trastuzumab emtansine

**Usage:**

Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) used to treat HER2-positive breast cancer.  Specifically, it's indicated for:

* **Treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have received prior therapy including trastuzumab and a taxane.** This means it's usually used after other treatments have failed.
* **Treatment of patients with HER2-positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer that cannot be removed surgically.**

It's important to note that the specific usage and dosage are determined by a physician based on the individual patient's condition and medical history.

**Side Effects:**

Ado-trastuzumab emtansine, like other cancer treatments, can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, decreased appetite, hair loss (alopecia), peripheral neuropathy (numbness or tingling in the hands and feet), constipation, headache, and cough.
* **Serious side effects:**  Low blood cell counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), liver problems (increased liver enzymes), heart problems (cardiomyopathy), pulmonary toxicity (lung problems),  severe allergic reactions, and infusion-related reactions.

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects vary from person to person.  It's crucial to report any side effects to your doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is a targeted therapy.  It works by combining a monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab) that targets HER2 receptors on cancer cells with a potent chemotherapy drug (emtansine).  The trastuzumab part delivers the emtansine directly to HER2-positive cancer cells, minimizing damage to healthy cells.  Once inside the cancer cell, the emtansine disrupts the cell's ability to grow and divide, leading to cell death.
