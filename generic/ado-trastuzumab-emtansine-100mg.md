# Ado-trastuzumab emtansine 100mg

**Generic Name:** Ado-trastuzumab emtansine

**Usage:** Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) used to treat HER2-positive breast cancer.  Specifically, it's used in patients who have already received at least two prior treatments for metastatic disease.  It may be used in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body after treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane.  It's important to note that its usage is dictated by a physician based on individual patient needs and medical history.

**Side Effects:**  The side effects of ado-trastuzumab emtansine can be significant and vary in severity.  Common side effects include:

* **Low blood cell counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia):** This increases the risk of infection and bleeding.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Often manageable with anti-nausea medication.
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling tired and weak.
* **Alopecia (hair loss):**  Can range from thinning to complete hair loss.
* **Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the hands and feet):**  Can cause numbness, tingling, pain, and weakness.
* **Diarrhea:**  Can be severe in some cases.
* **Increased risk of infection:** Due to low white blood cell counts.
* **Liver problems:**  Elevated liver enzymes.
* **Cardiac toxicity (rare but serious):**  Heart problems, including reduced heart function.  Requires close monitoring.

This is not an exhaustive list, and more serious side effects are possible.  Patients should report any new or worsening symptoms to their doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is a targeted therapy. It works by combining an antibody (trastuzumab) that specifically targets the HER2 protein found on the surface of some breast cancer cells with a potent chemotherapy drug (emtansine).  The antibody acts like a guided missile, delivering the chemotherapy directly to the cancer cells expressing HER2.  This targeted approach aims to minimize damage to healthy cells while maximizing the effect on cancer cells.
