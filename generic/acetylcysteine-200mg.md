# Acetylcysteine 200mg

**Generic Name:** Acetylcysteine

**Usage:**

Acetylcysteine 200mg is primarily used for:

* **Treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose:** This is its most crucial application.  It works by replenishing glutathione, a vital antioxidant depleted by paracetamol overdose, thereby preventing liver damage.  It's typically administered intravenously (IV) in high doses for this purpose, not orally as a 200mg tablet.  A 200mg oral tablet would not be sufficient for paracetamol overdose treatment.

* **Breaking down mucus:**  Oral acetylcysteine can help thin and loosen thick mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up. This is used to treat conditions such as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis.  While a 200mg dose might be part of a larger regimen, it's unlikely to be a single effective dose for this purpose. Higher doses and/or multiple doses per day are typically prescribed.

* **Prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN):**  Some studies suggest that acetylcysteine may help protect the kidneys from damage caused by contrast dyes used in medical imaging procedures.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary depending on the dosage and route of administration (oral vs. intravenous). Common side effects of oral acetylcysteine include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Stomachache
* Mouth sores
*  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing) - Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.

Less common but more serious side effects are possible and may include:

* Bronchospasm (wheezing, shortness of breath) - particularly relevant in patients with asthma or other respiratory conditions.
* Liver problems (rare, but important given its use in paracetamol overdose treatment)

**How it Works:**

Acetylcysteine's mechanism of action depends on its usage:

* **Paracetamol overdose:** It acts as a precursor to glutathione, a crucial antioxidant that helps neutralize the toxic metabolite of paracetamol (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine - NAPQI) that damages the liver.

* **Mucus thinning:** It breaks disulfide bonds in mucus glycoproteins, reducing their viscosity and making the mucus less sticky and easier to expectorate.

* **Contrast-induced nephropathy:**  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's thought to involve antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, potentially protecting kidney cells from damage.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take acetylcysteine 200mg for a cough without a doctor's prescription?** A:  It's best to consult a doctor before using acetylcysteine for a cough. While it can help thin mucus, self-treating can be risky, and other underlying conditions might require different treatment.  Also, a 200mg dose might be insufficient for effective mucus-thinning.

* **Q: Is acetylcysteine addictive?** A: No, acetylcysteine is not addictive.

* **Q:  Can I take acetylcysteine with other medications?** A:  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. Interactions are possible.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q:  What are the storage requirements for acetylcysteine?** A:  Store as directed on the packaging, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
