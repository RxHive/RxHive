# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 50000 IU

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 50000 IU

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and post-surgical or post-traumatic inflammation.  The aceclofenac and paracetamol provide analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, while the trypsin and chymotrypsin are proteolytic enzymes that help reduce swelling and inflammation by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory process.  **It is crucial to note that this information is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice. Always follow the prescription and instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.**  The specific usage will depend on the individual's condition and the physician's assessment.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person, but common ones may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, peptic ulcers (rare but serious).
* **Allergic Reactions:** Skin rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema), difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis - a medical emergency).
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness.
* **Liver:**  Abnormal liver function tests (rare but serious).
* **Kidney:**  Fluid retention, changes in urine output (rare but serious).
* **Other:** Increased risk of bleeding, bruising.

This is not an exhaustive list, and serious side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or unusual side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  An analgesic and antipyretic (fever-reducing) drug that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs, reducing pain and fever but with less anti-inflammatory effect than aceclofenac.
* **Trypsin and Chymotrypsin:** Proteolytic enzymes that break down proteins associated with inflammation and swelling, thus reducing edema and promoting faster healing.  They may work by improving blood circulation and lymphatic drainage at the site of inflammation.

The combination of these three components aims to provide a comprehensive approach to pain and inflammation management, addressing the issue from multiple pathways.
