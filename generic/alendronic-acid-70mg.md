# Alendronic Acid 70mg

**Generic Name:** Alendronic Acid

**Usage:**

Alendronic acid is used to treat and prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at increased risk of fractures.  It's also used to treat Paget's disease of bone.  The specific use and dosage will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and medical history.  It works by slowing bone loss and increasing bone density.  Importantly, it does *not* repair existing fractures.

**Side Effects:**

Alendronic acid can cause a range of side effects, some common and others rare but serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** These are the most frequent, and can include heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation.
* **Esophageal irritation:**  This is a serious concern.  Alendronate can irritate the esophagus if not taken correctly (see FAQs).
* **Muscle and joint pain:**  Some patients experience aches and pains in muscles and joints.
* **Headache:**
* **Eye irritation (rare):**


Serious, though less common, side effects include:

* **Esophageal ulcers or strictures (narrowing):**  Requires immediate medical attention.
* **Jaw osteonecrosis (bone death):** Particularly a risk in patients undergoing dental procedures.
* **Atypical femur fractures:**  Stress fractures in the thigh bone.
* **Severe bone, muscle, or joint pain:**


This is not an exhaustive list, and individual experiences can vary.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.

**How it Works:**

Alendronic acid is a bisphosphonate.  It works by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption (breakdown). By reducing bone resorption, alendronic acid helps maintain bone mass and reduce the risk of fractures.  This results in a net increase in bone density over time.

**FAQs:**

* **How should I take alendronic acid?**  It's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  Generally, it's taken once weekly, first thing in the morning, at least 30 minutes before food or drink (except plain water).  Remain upright (sitting or standing) for at least 30 minutes after taking the pill to prevent esophageal irritation.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Do not take a double dose.  Simply take the next dose as scheduled.
* **Can I take alendronic acid with other medications?**  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.
* **What are the long-term effects of alendronic acid?**  Long-term use may be associated with an increased risk of atypical femur fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw.  Regular monitoring by your doctor is crucial.
* **What if I have dental work planned?**  Inform your dentist that you are taking alendronic acid.  Your doctor may advise you to temporarily stop taking the medication before and after dental procedures.
* **Is alendronic acid safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Alendronic acid is generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Consult your doctor.
