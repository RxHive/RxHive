# Albumin 20%

**Generic Name:** Albumin (Human) 20%

**Usage:** Albumin 20% is a blood volume expander used to treat hypovolemic shock (low blood volume) resulting from various causes, including burns, surgery, trauma, and severe bleeding.  It's also used to treat conditions associated with low protein levels in the blood (hypoproteinemia), such as liver disease and kidney failure.  Specific indications may vary depending on local regulatory guidelines. It is administered intravenously.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can range from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* Fever
* Chills
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Muscle aches
* Chest pain
* Swelling at the injection site

More serious, though less frequent, side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to anaphylaxis – a life-threatening reaction)
* Fluid overload (pulmonary edema – fluid in the lungs)
* Increased heart rate
* Irregular heartbeat
* Changes in blood pressure
* Thrombosis (blood clot formation)

**How it Works:** Albumin is a naturally occurring protein in human blood plasma.  The 20% solution is a concentrated form of this protein.  When administered intravenously, it increases the colloid osmotic pressure of the blood, drawing fluid from the interstitial space (the space between cells) into the blood vessels.  This increases blood volume and helps to restore blood pressure.  In cases of hypoproteinemia, it replaces lost protein, helping to improve the body's overall protein balance.

* **What are the contraindications?**  Albumin 20% should not be used in patients with severe heart failure, severe anemia, or known allergy to human albumin.  It should be used cautiously in patients with hypertension, renal failure, or dehydration.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should only use it under strict medical supervision.
* **How is it administered?**  Albumin 20% is administered intravenously by a healthcare professional.  The rate of administration and dosage depend on the patient's condition and response to treatment.
* **Are there any drug interactions?**  No significant drug interactions are commonly reported, but informing the treating physician of all medications being taken is crucial.
* **What are the storage requirements?**  Albumin 20% should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually at a specific temperature range to maintain its effectiveness.  Always check the label for specific instructions.
* **Is there a generic alternative?** While the term "generic" implies a copy of a brand-name drug, different manufacturers may produce albumin solutions.  The term “generic albumin 20%” refers to the fact that it is not a brand-name product.  The active ingredient and dosage are the same across manufacturers, though some minor variations in inactive ingredients might occur.
