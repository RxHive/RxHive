# Acarbose 100mg

**Generic Name:** Acarbose

**Usage:**

Acarbose is used to treat type 2 diabetes. It's an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, meaning it works by slowing down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine. This results in a slower and smaller rise in blood sugar levels after meals.  It's typically used in conjunction with diet and exercise, and sometimes other diabetes medications.  It's *not* used to treat type 1 diabetes.

**Side Effects:**

The most common side effects of acarbose are gastrointestinal, and usually mild.  These can include:

* **Gas:** Often the most prominent side effect.
* **Bloating:**  A feeling of fullness or pressure in the abdomen.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Abdominal cramps or pain:**  Discomfort in the stomach area.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur.  These include:

* **Liver problems:**  Though rare, liver damage is a potential risk. Regular monitoring of liver function may be necessary.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms such as rash, itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing.
* **Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia):**  This is more likely if acarbose is used in combination with other diabetes medications, especially insulin.


**How it Works:**

Acarbose works by inhibiting alpha-glucosidases, enzymes in the small intestine that break down complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars (glucose). By blocking these enzymes, acarbose slows the rate at which carbohydrates are absorbed into the bloodstream. This leads to a more gradual and less dramatic increase in blood glucose levels after meals.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take acarbose if I have type 1 diabetes?**  A: No, acarbose is not typically used for type 1 diabetes.  Type 1 diabetes requires insulin therapy.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: What should I eat while taking acarbose?** A:  Maintain a balanced diet as prescribed by your doctor or dietitian.  Focus on consistent carbohydrate intake throughout the day, rather than large amounts at once.

* **Q: Can I take acarbose with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking. Some medications may interact with acarbose.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe side effects such as severe abdominal pain, allergic reactions, or signs of liver problems.

* **Q:  Is acarbose safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using acarbose during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  It's usually not recommended during pregnancy.
