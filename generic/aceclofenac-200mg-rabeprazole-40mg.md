# Aceclofenac 200mg + Rabeprazole 40mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 200mg + Rabeprazole 40mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other painful conditions.  Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation. Rabeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces stomach acid production.  The rabeprazole is included to help protect the stomach lining from the potential ulcer-causing effects of aceclofenac.  It's crucial to only use this medication as prescribed by a doctor.  It is not suitable for long-term use without ongoing medical supervision.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include but are not limited to:

* **Common:**  Headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, flatulence, dizziness, drowsiness.
* **Less Common:**  Skin rash, itching, swelling, heartburn, increased liver enzymes, changes in blood counts.
* **Serious (requires immediate medical attention):**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), stomach ulcers, bleeding, perforation (hole) in the stomach or intestines, kidney problems, liver problems, severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis).

This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult the patient information leaflet provided with your medication or your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain and inflammation.  By reducing prostaglandin production, it reduces pain and swelling at the site of inflammation.
* **Rabeprazole:** Reduces stomach acid production by inhibiting the proton pump in the stomach lining. This protective effect minimizes the risk of stomach ulcers and related complications often associated with long-term NSAID use.
