# Albumin 5% w/v

**Generic Name:** Albumin (Human) 5% w/v

**Usage:** Albumin 5% w/v is a blood volume expander used to treat hypovolemic shock and other conditions associated with low blood volume.  Specific uses include:

* **Hypovolemic shock:**  Replenishing blood volume lost due to trauma, surgery, burns, or other causes.
* **Hypoalbuminemia:**  Treating low levels of albumin in the blood, a condition that can occur in various diseases like liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and malnutrition.
* **Burns:** Replacing protein lost due to extensive burns.
* **Cardiac surgery:** Supporting circulatory function during and after cardiac surgery.
* **Other conditions:**  May be used in other situations where plasma volume expansion is needed, as determined by a physician.  This is not an exhaustive list.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, albumin can cause side effects, although they are relatively uncommon with proper administration.  Possible side effects include:

* **Fluid overload:**  This is a serious potential side effect, particularly in patients with heart or kidney problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, swelling in the legs and ankles, and increased blood pressure.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but potentially serious, ranging from mild rash to anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction).  Symptoms include itching, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, and decreased blood pressure.
* **Fever:**  A mild fever may occur.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Less common side effects.
* **Increased risk of infection:**  Because albumin is derived from human blood, there is a small risk of transmitting infectious diseases, although rigorous screening and processing minimize this risk.


**How it Works:** Albumin is a protein naturally found in human blood plasma. It makes up a significant portion of the blood's colloid osmotic pressure, which helps maintain blood volume within the vessels. When administered intravenously, albumin 5% w/v increases the blood volume by expanding the plasma compartment. This helps restore blood pressure and tissue perfusion in individuals with hypovolemia.  It also helps to transport hormones and other substances throughout the body.
