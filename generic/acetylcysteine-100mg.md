# Acetylcysteine 100mg

**Generic Name:** Acetylcysteine

**Usage:**

Acetylcysteine 100mg is typically used for the treatment of acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose.  It's a crucial antidote in preventing severe liver damage caused by acetaminophen poisoning.  At lower doses, it might be used as a mucolytic agent to thin and loosen mucus in the lungs, aiding in the treatment of certain respiratory conditions like bronchitis and cystic fibrosis.  However, 100mg doses are generally insufficient for this purpose and higher doses are usually prescribed for mucolytic use.  **Always follow the prescription and dosage instructions given by your doctor or pharmacist.**  Do not use this medication without a prescription.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Mouth sores
* Headache
* Difficulty breathing (in case of a hypersensitivity reaction)

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Severe nausea and vomiting
* Severe abdominal pain
* Unusual bleeding or bruising
* Dizziness or lightheadedness
* Bronchospasm (constriction of the airways)


**How it Works:**

In the case of acetaminophen overdose, acetylcysteine works by replenishing glutathione, a vital liver compound depleted by acetaminophen.  This helps the liver metabolize the toxic byproduct of acetaminophen and prevents further liver damage.

As a mucolytic agent (at higher doses), acetylcysteine breaks down disulfide bonds in mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel. This helps clear the airways.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take acetylcysteine 100mg for a cough?** A:  A 100mg dose is usually too low to be effective as a mucolytic. Higher doses are typically needed for this purpose and should only be taken under the direction of a physician.
* **Q: Is it safe to take acetylcysteine with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting acetylcysteine. Interactions are possible.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store acetylcysteine?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.
* **Q:  What should I do if I suspect an overdose?** A:  Contact your doctor or a poison control center immediately.  Overdose of any medication can be dangerous.
