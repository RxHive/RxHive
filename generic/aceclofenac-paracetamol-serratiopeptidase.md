**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, indigestion.
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness.

**How it Works:** This combination medication works through the synergistic effects of its three components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic and antipyretic that reduces pain and fever, though its exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood. It's thought to work centrally in the brain to reduce pain perception.
* **Serratiopeptidase:** A proteolytic enzyme that breaks down proteins. It's thought to help reduce inflammation and swelling by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory process, potentially improving pain relief and reducing tissue damage.
