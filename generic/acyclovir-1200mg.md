# Acyclovir 1200mg

**Generic Name:** Acyclovir

**Usage:** Acyclovir 1200mg is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat infections caused by herpes viruses, including:

* **Genital herpes (HSV-2):**  Reduces the frequency and duration of outbreaks.  It does *not* cure herpes.
* **Oral herpes (HSV-1):** Shortens the duration and severity of cold sores.
* **Chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus):**  Reduces the severity and duration of the illness, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.
* **Shingles (herpes zoster):**  Reduces the pain and duration of the rash.

The specific dosage and duration of treatment will vary depending on the type and severity of the infection and the patient's health status.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.  A 1200mg dose is usually divided into multiple smaller doses throughout the day.


**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Rash

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Kidney problems (especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney disease)
* Neurological problems (confusion, seizures, tremors)
* Blood disorders


**How it Works:** Acyclovir is a nucleoside analog.  This means it mimics a building block of DNA and RNA.  When the herpes virus tries to replicate its genetic material, it incorporates acyclovir into its DNA. This stops the virus from replicating effectively, slowing its growth and reducing the severity of the infection.  It's important to note that acyclovir does not eradicate the virus; the virus remains latent in the body.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take acyclovir to prevent herpes outbreaks?**  A:  Acyclovir can be prescribed for suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of outbreaks in certain individuals, but this requires a doctor's prescription and ongoing monitoring.
* **Q: Can I take acyclovir if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  You should consult your doctor before taking acyclovir during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  The benefits and risks need to be carefully weighed.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The effects of acyclovir will vary depending on the condition being treated.  It typically starts working within a few days, but complete resolution of symptoms can take longer.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking acyclovir?** A:  While there's no direct interaction between alcohol and acyclovir, excessive alcohol consumption can exacerbate some side effects and generally isn't recommended while taking medication.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about missed doses.
