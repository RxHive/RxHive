# Aceclofenac + Paracetamol + Tizanidine

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac + Paracetamol + Tizanidine

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Acute musculoskeletal pain (e.g., back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain)

It's often prescribed for conditions where pain involves both inflammation and muscle spasm.  The specific dosages and duration of treatment will be determined by a doctor based on the individual's condition and response to the medication.  **It is crucial to use this medication only as prescribed by a doctor.**


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include, but are not limited to:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, indigestion, headache, dizziness, drowsiness,  sleepiness, weakness, abdominal pain.
* **Less Common:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), changes in liver function tests, increased risk of bleeding, blurred vision.
* **Rare but Serious:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), severe liver damage, gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, heart problems.


**How it Works:** This combination medication works through the synergistic action of its three components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic and antipyretic (pain reliever and fever reducer) that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs, reducing pain and fever.  The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's thought to involve inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system.
* **Tizanidine:** A muscle relaxant that reduces muscle spasms and stiffness by acting on the central nervous system, specifically alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the spinal cord.
