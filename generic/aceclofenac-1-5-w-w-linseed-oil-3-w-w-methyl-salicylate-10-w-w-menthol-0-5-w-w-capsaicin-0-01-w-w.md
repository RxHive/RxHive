# Aceclofenac 1.5% w/w + Linseed Oil 3% w/w + Methyl Salicylate 10% w/w + Menthol 0.5% w/w + Capsaicin 0.01% w/w

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 1.5% w/w + Linseed Oil 3% w/w + Methyl Salicylate 10% w/w + Menthol 0.5% w/w + Capsaicin 0.01% w/w Topical Analgesic Gel/Cream (Note: There isn't a single generic name for this specific combination; this is a descriptive generic name)

**Usage:** This topical analgesic gel/cream is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as:

* Arthritis (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis)
* Sprains
* Strains
* Bruises
* Back pain
* Soft tissue injuries

It should be applied directly to the affected area as directed by a doctor or pharmacist.  Frequency of application will vary depending on the severity of symptoms and individual response.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site.  They can include:

* Skin irritation (redness, burning, itching, rash)
* Swelling
* Blistering
* Allergic reactions (in rare cases)
* Increased sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity - particularly with prolonged use and exposure)

**Note:**  This list isn't exhaustive.  Serious side effects are rare but possible and require immediate medical attention. If you experience any unusual or severe symptoms, stop using the product and consult a doctor.


**How it Works:** This combination product works through a multi-modal mechanism:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Linseed Oil:** Provides emollient properties, softening and moisturizing the skin, and may have some anti-inflammatory effects.
* **Methyl Salicylate:** A counterirritant that produces a warming sensation, distracting from pain and potentially increasing blood flow to the affected area.
* **Menthol:** A counterirritant that produces a cooling sensation, also acting as a mild anesthetic and potentially reducing pain and inflammation.
* **Capsaicin:** A naturally occurring chemical found in chili peppers. It acts as a counterirritant, depleting substance P (a neurotransmitter involved in pain transmission), thus reducing pain sensation over time.  Initial application may cause a burning sensation.
