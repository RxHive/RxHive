# Albendazole 300mg

**Generic Name:** Albendazole

**Usage:** Albendazole is an antiparasitic medication used to treat various worm infestations (helminthiases).  Specific uses include:

* **Neurocysticercosis (NCC):**  The larval stage of the pork tapeworm ( *Taenia solium*) in the brain and other tissues.  This is often a long-term treatment.
* **Hydatid disease (echinococcosis):** Caused by the larval stage of the *Echinococcus* tapeworm.  This is typically a long-term treatment, often in combination with surgery.
* **Ascariasis:** Infection with roundworms (*Ascaris lumbricoides*).
* **Trichuriasis:** Infection with whipworms (*Trichuris trichiura*).
* **Hookworm infections:** Infections with hookworms (*Necator americanus* and *Ancylostoma duodenale*).
* **Strongyloidiasis:** Infection with threadworms (*Strongyloides stercoralis*).
* **Enterobiasis (pinworm infection):** Infection with *Enterobius vermicularis*.
* **Toxocariasis:** Infection with *Toxocara canis* or *Toxocara cati*.

**Note:** The specific dosage and duration of treatment vary greatly depending on the type of infection and the patient's age and health.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescription precisely.


**Side Effects:**  Albendazole is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur.  These may include:

* **Common side effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, fatigue, fever.
* **Less common but more serious side effects:**  Elevated liver enzymes (liver damage), decreased white blood cell count (leukopenia), hair loss (alopecia), rash,  Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
* **Rare but serious side effects:** Bone marrow suppression, seizures, visual disturbances.


**How it Works:** Albendazole interferes with the microtubules in the parasitic worms, which are essential for their metabolism and reproduction.  This disruption leads to the death of the parasites.  It's important to note that it's not effective against all types of parasites.
