# Acarbose 25mg + Metformin 500mg

**Generic Name:** Acarbose 25mg + Metformin 500mg (This is a combination drug, so it doesn't have one single generic name like Metformin alone would have.)  The individual generic names are Acarbose and Metformin.

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by improving the body's response to insulin and decreasing the amount of sugar produced by the liver.  Acarbose slows down the digestion of carbohydrates, preventing rapid spikes in blood sugar after meals. Metformin lowers glucose production in the liver and increases insulin sensitivity. It's typically used when diet and exercise alone haven't been enough to control blood sugar levels.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage and usage based on individual needs.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary between individuals, and the severity depends on factors such as dosage and individual sensitivity.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** These are more common with Acarbose and can include bloating, gas, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and nausea.  These are usually mild and may lessen over time as the body adjusts.
* **Metformin side effects:** These can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, metallic taste in the mouth, and vitamin B12 deficiency (long-term use).  More serious, but less common, side effects include lactic acidosis (a rare but serious condition).
* **Other potential side effects:** Headache, dizziness, and skin rash are also possibilities.


**How it Works:**

* **Acarbose:** This is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. It works by slowing down the breakdown of complex carbohydrates in the digestive tract. This leads to a slower and more gradual rise in blood glucose levels after meals.
* **Metformin:** This is a biguanide. It works in several ways to lower blood glucose:  It reduces glucose production by the liver, increases insulin sensitivity in muscle and fat tissues, and slightly improves insulin secretion from the pancreas.
