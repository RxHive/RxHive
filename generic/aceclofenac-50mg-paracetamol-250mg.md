Rare but serious side effects may include:

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) that works through a different mechanism, primarily affecting the central nervous system to reduce pain perception and fever.  The combination of aceclofenac and paracetamol provides synergistic pain relief, often better than either drug alone.
