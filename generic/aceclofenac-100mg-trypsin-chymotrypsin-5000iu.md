# Aceclofenac 100mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 5000IU

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 5000IU

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue injuries.  Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation, while trypsin and chymotrypsin are proteolytic enzymes that help reduce swelling and inflammation by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory process.  It's crucial to note that this combination is not a first-line treatment for these conditions and should be used as directed by a physician.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, peptic ulcers (rare but serious).
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and high blood pressure (especially with long-term use).
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, confusion.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis â€“ a serious, life-threatening reaction).
* **Other:**  Fluid retention, increased liver enzyme levels, changes in kidney function.  Trypsin and chymotrypsin may rarely cause allergic reactions.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This NSAID works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.  By reducing prostaglandin production, aceclofenac helps to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.

* **Trypsin and Chymotrypsin:** These are proteolytic enzymes that break down proteins involved in the inflammatory process.  This helps to reduce swelling and promote faster healing of soft tissues.  The exact mechanism by which they reduce inflammation is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve the breakdown of inflammatory mediators.
