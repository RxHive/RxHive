**Important Note:** This is not a complete list of side effects.  Consult a healthcare professional if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.

**How it Works:** This combination medication works through the combined actions of its components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  An analgesic and antipyretic (reduces fever) that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs, primarily in the central nervous system. The exact mechanism of its anti-inflammatory effect is not fully understood.
* **Trypsin Chymotrypsin:** These are proteolytic enzymes (proteases) that help break down proteins involved in inflammation and swelling. They may promote faster healing and reduce pain by helping to remove debris at the site of injury.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women should also consult their doctor before taking this medication.
