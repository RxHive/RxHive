# Alcaftadine 0.25% w/v

**Generic Name:** Alcaftadine

**Usage:** Alcaftadine 0.25% w/v ophthalmic solution is used to treat allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane that lines the inside of the eyelid and covers the white part of the eye).  It relieves symptoms such as itching, redness, and swelling.


**Side Effects:**  Common side effects of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution include:

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye upon application
* Eye irritation
* Dry eyes
* Headache

Less common but more serious side effects are rare but should be reported to a doctor immediately. These can include:

* Vision changes
* Eye pain
* Increased eye pressure (glaucoma)


**How it Works:** Alcaftadine is an H1-receptor antagonist.  This means it works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine causes the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. By blocking histamine, alcaftadine reduces the inflammation and itching associated with the allergy.


**FAQs:**
