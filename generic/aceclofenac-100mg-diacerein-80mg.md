# Aceclofenac 100mg + Diacerein 80mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Diacerein 80mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease). Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation, while Diacerein is a chondroprotective agent believed to slow down cartilage degradation in the joints.  It's important to note that this combination is typically prescribed for *symptomatic relief* of osteoarthritis, meaning it manages the symptoms but doesn't cure the underlying disease.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and duration of treatment.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Aceclofenac 100mg + Diacerein 80mg can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects can include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, indigestion, peptic ulcers (rare but serious).
* **Liver:** Elevated liver enzymes (detected through blood tests).
* **Kidney:**  Fluid retention, changes in kidney function (especially in patients with pre-existing kidney problems).
* **Skin:**  Rash, itching, hives.
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness.
* **Other:**  Increased risk of bleeding, increased blood pressure.

**Rare but serious side effects:**  These include severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), serious gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, and serious liver or kidney damage.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious or unusual side effects.  The complete list of side effects is detailed in the medication's package insert.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This NSAID works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, aceclofenac helps to alleviate pain and inflammation in the affected joints.

* **Diacerein:** The exact mechanism of action of diacerein is not fully understood.  However, it's believed to have chondroprotective effects, meaning it helps protect and potentially slow down the breakdown of cartilage in the joints.  It's thought to do this by inhibiting inflammatory processes and potentially stimulating the production of cartilage matrix components.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Diacerein offers a dual approach to osteoarthritis management: Aceclofenac tackles the immediate pain and inflammation, while Diacerein potentially offers long-term benefits by aiming to protect the cartilage.


**FAQs:**

* **Who should not take this medication?**  People with known allergies to aceclofenac, diacerein, or other NSAIDs, those with severe liver or kidney disease, active peptic ulcers, bleeding disorders, and pregnant or breastfeeding women should generally avoid this medication.  Consult your doctor for specific advice.

* **Can I take this medication with other drugs?**  Interaction with other medications, including other NSAIDs, anticoagulants (blood thinners), and certain heart medications, are possible. Always inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **How long does it take to work?**  The pain-relieving effects of aceclofenac may be felt relatively quickly, while the chondroprotective effects of diacerein may take longer to become noticeable.

* **Can I stop taking this medication abruptly?**  You should always consult your doctor before stopping this medication.  Sudden cessation might lead to a rebound effect or withdrawal symptoms.
