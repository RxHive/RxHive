# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 75000AU

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 75000AU

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue injuries.  The specific conditions it's prescribed for will vary by physician and patient.  It's often used for post-operative pain and inflammation as well.  **Crucially, this information is not a substitute for a doctor's prescription and instructions.**  Always follow your doctor's directions for use.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but can include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, indigestion, heartburn, peptic ulcers (rare but serious).
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (rare but serious).
* **Other:**  Increased liver enzymes (detected by blood tests), fluid retention, increased bleeding risk (especially in conjunction with anticoagulants), elevated blood pressure.
* **Specific to Trypsin/Chymotrypsin:**  Rarely, allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur.

This is not an exhaustive list, and more severe or unusual side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience a serious allergic reaction or any severe side effect.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing inflammation and pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals involved in pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  A pain reliever and fever reducer.  Its exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood but is thought to involve inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system.  Unlike NSAIDs, it has minimal anti-inflammatory effects at usual doses.
* **Trypsin Chymotrypsin:** Proteolytic enzymes that help break down proteins involved in inflammation and swelling. They may assist in reducing inflammation and edema (swelling) at the site of injury. The exact mechanism of pain reduction is less clear but is related to their anti-inflammatory effects.

The combination provides a multi-pronged approach to pain and inflammation management, combining the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol with the protein-breakdown capabilities of Trypsin Chymotrypsin.
