# Albumin 5%

**Generic Name:** Albumin (Human) 5% Solution

**Usage:**

Albumin 5% is used to treat hypovolemic shock (low blood volume causing dangerously low blood pressure), and to replace protein lost due to various conditions. Specific uses include:

* **Hypovolemic shock:**  Replaces lost blood volume and helps restore blood pressure. This is often seen in trauma, surgery, burns, or severe bleeding.
* **Hypoproteinemia:**  Replaces protein lost due to conditions like liver disease (cirrhosis), kidney disease (nephrotic syndrome), malnutrition, or severe burns.
* **Treatment of edema associated with hypoproteinemia:** By increasing blood protein levels, it helps to pull fluid from tissues back into the bloodstream, reducing swelling.
* **Hemodialysis:**  Can be used during hemodialysis to maintain blood volume.

**Side Effects:**

Albumin 5% is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur. These may include:

* **Fluid overload:**  This is a serious side effect, particularly in patients with heart or kidney problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, swelling in the legs and ankles, and weight gain.
* **Fever:** A mild fever may occur.
* **Chills:** Feeling cold and shivering.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Gastrointestinal upset.
* **Allergic reactions:** Though rare, allergic reactions, ranging from mild rash to anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction), can occur.
* **Increased blood pressure:**  In some individuals.
* **Thrombophlebitis:**  Inflammation of the vein at the injection site.


**How it Works:**

Albumin 5% is a colloid solution meaning it contains large protein molecules that remain in the bloodstream. This increases the blood's oncotic pressure (the pressure exerted by proteins in the blood that helps keep fluid within the blood vessels). By increasing blood volume and oncotic pressure, albumin helps restore blood pressure, improves tissue perfusion (blood flow to tissues), and reduces edema.

**FAQs:**

* **Is Albumin 5% the same as blood transfusion?** No, it's not a blood product; it's a purified protein derived from human plasma. It doesn't contain red blood cells, white blood cells, or clotting factors.
* **Can I take Albumin 5% orally?** No, it's administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional.
* **How long does it take to work?** The effects of Albumin 5% are typically seen relatively quickly, but the duration of effect varies depending on the individual and the reason for administration.
* **Are there any contraindications?**  Albumin 5% should be used cautiously in patients with heart failure, kidney disease, severe anemia, or a history of allergic reactions to blood products.
* **What are the storage requirements?** Albumin 5% should be stored at room temperature and protected from light.  Specific storage details will be found on the product labeling.
* **Who should I contact if I have questions or side effects?** Consult your physician or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects after receiving Albumin 5%.
