**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac + Paracetamol + Chlorzoxazone

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as:

* **Osteoarthritis:**  Pain and stiffness in joints.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis:**  Inflammation and pain in joints.
* **Back pain:**  Pain in the lower back, often caused by muscle strain or other conditions.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, indigestion.

**How it Works:** This combination medication works through the synergistic action of its three components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  A pain reliever and fever reducer that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs.  The exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's thought to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.
* **Chlorzoxazone:** A muscle relaxant that reduces muscle spasms and pain by acting on the central nervous system.
