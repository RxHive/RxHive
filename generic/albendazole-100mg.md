# Albendazole 100mg

**Generic Name:** Albendazole

**Usage:** Albendazole is an anthelmintic (antiworm) medication used to treat a variety of parasitic worm infections, including:

* **Roundworm infections (nematodes):**  Ascariasis, Enterobiasis (pinworms), Trichuriasis (whipworms), Hookworm infections.
* **Tapeworm infections (cestodes):** Taeniasis (tapeworm), Hymenolepiasis.
* **Other parasitic infections:**  Cysticercosis (caused by the larval stage of the pork tapeworm), hydatid disease (caused by *Echinococcus* species).  Treatment for these latter two is usually longer-term and requires higher doses, often under close medical supervision.


**Side Effects:**  Albendazole is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur.  These vary in frequency and severity.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Fatigue**
* **Elevated liver enzymes (liver function tests)** - this requires monitoring, especially with long-term use.
* **Hair loss (alopecia)** - relatively uncommon.
* **Rare but serious side effects:**  Bone marrow suppression (decreased blood cell counts), severe liver damage, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction).


**How it Works:** Albendazole interferes with the worms' ability to absorb glucose (sugar), a vital nutrient for their survival.  This leads to paralysis and death of the parasites, allowing the body's immune system to eliminate them.  The exact mechanism is complex and involves multiple targets within the worm's cells.
