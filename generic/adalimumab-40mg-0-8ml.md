**How it Works:** Adalimumab is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker.  TNF is a protein involved in inflammation. By blocking TNF, adalimumab reduces the inflammation that causes the symptoms of these conditions.  It works by binding to TNF and preventing it from interacting with its receptors on cells, thus interrupting the inflammatory cascade.
