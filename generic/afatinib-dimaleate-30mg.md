# Afatinib dimaleate 30mg

**Generic Name:** Afatinib dimaleate

**Usage:** Afatinib dimaleate is a targeted therapy used to treat certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Specifically, it's used in patients whose tumors have a specific genetic mutation called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) mutations.  It may also be used in patients with metastatic NSCLC whose disease has progressed after treatment with other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).  *It is crucial to note that afatinib is only used in patients whose cancer has been tested and confirmed to have the appropriate EGFR mutations*.  The specific usage and dosage will be determined by a physician based on the individual patient's condition and response to treatment.

**Side Effects:** Afatinib, like other targeted therapies, can cause a range of side effects.  These can vary in severity from mild to severe.  Some common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea:** Often severe and may require hospitalization.  Prophylactic anti-diarrheal medication is often prescribed.
* **Rash:** Can range from mild to severe, including acneiform rash.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Can affect appetite and hydration.
* **Stomach pain:** Can be related to diarrhea or other gastrointestinal issues.
* **Dry skin:** Often accompanied by dryness of the eyes and mouth (xerostomia).
* **Nail changes:**  Including thickening, discoloration, or fragility.
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling tired or weak.
* **Pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs):** A serious side effect requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Liver problems:**  Elevated liver enzymes.
* **Eye problems:**  Dry eyes, conjunctivitis.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Such as low potassium or magnesium.

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary significantly between individuals.  It's vital to report any unusual or worsening symptoms to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Afatinib is an irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  EGFR is a protein that plays a role in the growth and division of cells.  In certain lung cancers, mutations in the EGFR gene lead to uncontrolled cell growth.  Afatinib works by binding to and blocking the activity of the mutated EGFR protein, thereby inhibiting the growth and spread of cancer cells.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is afatinib taken?** A: Afatinib is typically taken orally once daily, usually with food.  The specific dosage and instructions must be followed precisely as prescribed by a physician.

* **Q: How long does treatment with afatinib last?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the individual's response to the medication and the progression of the disease.  It's usually continued until the cancer progresses or intolerable side effects occur.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take
