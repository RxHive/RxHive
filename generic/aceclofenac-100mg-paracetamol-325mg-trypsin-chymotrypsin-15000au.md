**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 15000AU

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various musculoskeletal conditions such as:

**Important Note:**  This information is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting any new medication, including this combination.  The specific usage and dosage will depend on individual needs and the doctor's assessment.  Self-medicating can be harmful.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person, but some common ones include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, peptic ulcers (rare but serious)
* **Allergic Reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling (angioedema), difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis - rare but serious)
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness
* **Liver and Kidney:**  Elevated liver enzymes, kidney impairment (rare but serious, especially with prolonged use)
* **Other:**  Increased bleeding time (due to Trypsin Chymotrypsin),  fluid retention


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** A pain reliever and fever reducer. Its exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to act on the central nervous system to reduce pain perception and fever.
* **Trypsin Chymotrypsin:** Proteolytic enzymes that help break down proteins. In this context, they are believed to help reduce inflammation and edema (swelling) by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory process. This aids in faster healing of soft tissues.
