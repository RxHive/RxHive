# Afatinib dimaleate 20mg

**Generic Name:** Afatinib dimaleate

**Usage:** Afatinib dimaleate is a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used to treat certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Specifically, it's indicated for:

* **Metastatic NSCLC:**  Patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a specific EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution).  This means the cancer cells have a specific genetic abnormality that makes them sensitive to afatinib.
* **Metastatic NSCLC in certain situations:** It may also be used in some patients with metastatic NSCLC who have progressed after treatment with another EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  However, this would be determined by a physician considering individual patient factors.

**Important Note:** Afatinib is a prescription medication and should only be used under the supervision of a qualified oncologist or medical professional.  The specific usage and dosage will be determined based on individual patient needs and disease characteristics.

**Side Effects:**  Afatinib, like many cancer treatments, can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others severe.  These can include:

* **Common Side Effects:** Diarrhea (often severe), rash, dry skin, nail changes (thickening, discoloration), fatigue, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, mouth sores (stomatitis), eye irritation (conjunctivitis).
* **Serious Side Effects:**  Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs),  hepatotoxicity (liver damage),  diarrhea leading to dehydration,  severe skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome),  electrolyte imbalances (particularly potassium and magnesium).

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary greatly from person to person.  Patients should report any concerning symptoms to their doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Afatinib works by selectively inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase.  EGFR is a protein found on the surface of certain cancer cells, and its activation promotes cell growth and division.  By blocking EGFR, afatinib prevents cancer cells from receiving signals to grow and divide, thereby slowing or stopping the cancer's progression.  Specifically, it targets EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution) making it effective primarily in patients whose tumors have these specific genetic changes.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is afatinib administered?**  A: Afatinib is typically taken orally once daily as a tablet.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for instructions. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: What are the potential drug interactions?**  A: Afatinib can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of afatinib?** A: Long-term effects can vary, and ongoing monitoring is crucial.  Some potential long-term effects may include persistent skin changes, chronic diarrhea, or other organ-related issues.  Your oncologist will monitor you for these possibilities.

* **Q:  Is afatinib suitable for everyone with lung cancer?** A: No. It's only suitable for patients with specific EGFR mutations in their lung cancer.  Genetic testing is necessary to determine eligibility.
