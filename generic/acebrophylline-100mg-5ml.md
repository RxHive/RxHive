# Acebrophylline 100mg/5ml

**Generic Name:** Acebrophylline

**Usage:**  Acebrophylline is a bronchodilator used to treat reversible airway obstruction associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including bronchitis and emphysema, and asthma. It's often prescribed to relieve symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.  The 100mg/5ml concentration indicates it's a liquid formulation, typically for pediatric or patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.  Dosage must always be determined by a physician and will vary depending on the patient's age, weight, and severity of the condition.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, acebrophylline can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects may include:

* **Headache:** A relatively frequent side effect.
* **Nausea:**  Can occur, sometimes accompanied by vomiting.
* **Upset stomach:**  Mild to moderate gastrointestinal discomfort.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping.
* **Tremors:**  Shaking or trembling, usually mild.
* **Heart palpitations:**  Awareness of a rapid or irregular heartbeat.
* **Nervousness:**  Feeling anxious or jittery.


More serious, though less common, side effects can include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, hives, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (anaphylaxis).  Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* **Seizures:**  Rare, but a potential serious side effect.
* **Cardiac arrhythmias:**  Irregular heartbeat.


This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.

**How it Works:** Acebrophylline is a methylxanthine derivative. It works by relaxing the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.  It achieves this by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic AMP (cAMP).  Increased cAMP levels lead to bronchodilation and reduced inflammation.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take acebrophylline with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as acebrophylline can interact with some drugs.  This is especially important with medications affecting the heart or central nervous system.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the individual and the route of administration.  Generally, you should start to feel relief within a short time, but the full effect may take longer.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double up on doses.

* **Q: Can I stop taking acebrophylline suddenly?** A:  No, you should never stop taking acebrophylline abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can worsen your condition.  Your doctor will likely recommend a gradual tapering off of the medication.

* **Q: Is acebrophylline safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A: The safety of acebrophylline during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Always discuss this with your doctor before taking it if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.
