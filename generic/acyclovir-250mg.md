# Acyclovir 250mg

**Generic Name:** Acyclovir

**Usage:** Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat infections caused by herpes viruses, including:

* **Genital herpes (HSV-2):**  Reduces the frequency, duration, and severity of outbreaks.  It does *not* cure herpes.
* **Oral herpes (HSV-1):**  Shortens the duration and severity of cold sores.
* **Chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus):**  Reduces the severity and duration of the illness.
* **Shingles (herpes zoster):**  Reduces pain and the duration of the rash.


**Note:**  The specific dosage and duration of treatment vary depending on the type of infection and the patient's health.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Rash

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Kidney problems (especially with high doses or impaired kidney function)
* Nervous system problems (such as confusion, hallucinations, seizures)
* Anemia
* Low white blood cell count

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.

**How it Works:** Acyclovir is a nucleoside analog.  This means it mimics a building block of viral DNA.  When the herpes virus tries to replicate, it incorporates acyclovir into its DNA. This stops the virus from reproducing effectively, allowing the body's immune system to clear the infection.


**FAQs:**

* **Is acyclovir a cure for herpes?** No, acyclovir does not cure herpes. It only helps to manage symptoms and reduce the frequency and severity of outbreaks.
* **Can I take acyclovir if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  You should discuss this with your doctor.  While generally considered safe in pregnancy, the potential benefits must be weighed against the potential risks.  It's important to inform your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant.
* **Can I take acyclovir with other medications?**  Some medications can interact with acyclovir.  Tell your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **What if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **How long does it take to work?** The effects of acyclovir vary depending on the infection and the individual.  You may start to see improvement within a few days, but it may take longer for a complete resolution.
* **Can acyclovir cause kidney problems?** Yes, particularly with high doses or in individuals with pre-existing kidney problems.  Your doctor will monitor your kidney function if you are taking high doses of acyclovir.
