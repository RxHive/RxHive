# Aceclofenac 25mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac

**Usage:** Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Other forms of musculoskeletal pain and inflammation
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic pain
* Dental pain (often as part of a combination therapy)

It's important to note that aceclofenac should only be used as directed by a doctor and for the specific condition it's prescribed for.  Self-treating with aceclofenac is not recommended.

**Side Effects:** Like other NSAIDs, aceclofenac can cause a range of side effects, varying in severity from mild to serious. Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Indigestion
* Heartburn
* Flatulence

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Fluid retention
* High blood pressure
* Increased risk of heart attack and stroke
* Kidney problems
* Liver problems
* Ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding (potentially fatal)
* Anemia

**How it Works:** Aceclofenac works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, aceclofenac helps to alleviate pain and inflammation.

* **How long can I take aceclofenac?** The duration of treatment with aceclofenac will depend on your condition and your doctor's assessment.  Long-term use should be carefully monitored due to the risk of side effects.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, stop taking aceclofenac and contact your doctor immediately.
