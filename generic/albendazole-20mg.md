# Albendazole 20mg

**Generic Name:** Albendazole

**Usage:**

Albendazole 20mg is an anthelmintic medication, meaning it's used to treat parasitic worm infections.  The specific infections it treats depend on the dosage and duration of treatment, which should always be determined by a healthcare professional.  Common uses include:

* **Pinworm (Enterobiasis):**  A common intestinal infection.
* **Roundworm (Ascariasis):** Another common intestinal infection.
* **Hookworm (Ancylostomiasis):**  Intestinal infections that can cause anemia.
* **Whipworm (Trichuriasis):**  An intestinal infection.
* **Cysticercosis:**  An infection caused by the larval stage of the pork tapeworm ( *Taenia solium*).  This requires higher doses and longer treatment courses than for other infections listed.
* **Hydatid disease (Echinococcosis):**  A serious infection caused by the larval stage of the *Echinococcus* tapeworm.  This also requires higher doses and longer treatment courses, often in combination with other treatments.

**Note:** Albendazole 20mg is typically not the dosage used for cysticercosis or hydatid disease; much higher dosages are required for these serious conditions.  A healthcare professional must determine the appropriate dose and treatment plan for these infections.  This information is for general knowledge only and should not be used for self-treatment.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild and infrequent, but can include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Elevated liver enzymes (rare):**  This requires monitoring liver function.
* **Allergic reactions (rare):**  Such as rash, itching, swelling.
* **Bone marrow suppression (rare, usually with high doses and prolonged use):**  This can lead to decreased blood cell counts.


**How it Works:**

Albendazole interferes with the way parasitic worms absorb glucose, leading to their paralysis and death.  It inhibits the polymerization of tubulin, a protein crucial for the structure and function of the worms' cells.
