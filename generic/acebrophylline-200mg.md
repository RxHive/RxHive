# Acebrophylline 200mg

**Generic Name:** Acebrophylline

**Usage:**

Acebrophylline is a bronchodilator used to treat reversible airway obstruction associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and asthma.  It relaxes the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.  It's typically used as a long-term maintenance medication, not for immediate relief of acute breathing problems.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage and frequency based on individual needs.

**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, acebrophylline can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects can include:

* **Headache:** This is a relatively frequent side effect.
* **Nausea:** Some individuals may experience nausea, sometimes accompanied by vomiting.
* **Stomach upset:**  This can include heartburn, indigestion, or abdominal pain.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping is a possible side effect.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or dizzy.
* **Tremors:**  Shaking or trembling, usually mild.
* **Palpitations:**  A feeling of a rapid or irregular heartbeat.
* **Nervousness:**  Feeling anxious or jittery.


More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* **Seizures:** In rare instances, especially with higher doses or in individuals with pre-existing conditions, seizures may occur.
* **Arrhythmias:** Irregular heartbeats.
* **Hypotension:** Low blood pressure.


**How it Works:**

Acebrophylline is a methylxanthine derivative.  It works by relaxing the smooth muscles of the airways in the lungs, reducing bronchospasm and improving airflow.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's thought to involve inhibition of phosphodiesterase, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels, which ultimately causes bronchodilation.
