# ANTI-PSORIATIC

It's impossible to provide details on a single "generic anti-psoriatic" because there isn't one.  Psoriasis is treated with a variety of medications, each with its own generic name, mechanism of action, side effects, and usage.  These medications fall into different classes, including:

* **Topical corticosteroids:**  These are often the first line of treatment for mild psoriasis.
* **Topical retinoids:**  These help regulate skin cell growth.
* **Topical calcineurin inhibitors:**  These suppress the immune system in the skin.
* **Systemic medications (oral or injectable):**  These include methotrexate, cyclosporine, apremilast, and biologics (e.g., etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab).  Biologics target specific parts of the immune system.
* **Phototherapy (light therapy):** Uses ultraviolet light to slow skin cell growth.


Therefore, instead of providing information on a non-existent "generic anti-psoriatic," I can provide information on specific classes or individual medications.  Please specify which anti-psoriatic medication you'd like information on (e.g., methotrexate, adalimumab, topical corticosteroids).  Then I can provide the details in the requested format.
