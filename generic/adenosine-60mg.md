# Adenosine 60mg

**Generic Name:** Adenosine

**Usage:** Adenosine is used to diagnose certain types of rapid heartbeats (tachycardias) such as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).  It is administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional in a hospital or clinic setting and is *not* used for long-term treatment.  The diagnosis is made by observing the effect the adenosine has on the heart rhythm.

**Side Effects:** Adenosine's effects are usually short-lived.  The most common side effect is a brief feeling of flushing (redness in the face), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and a feeling of warmth.  These usually last only a few seconds.  More serious, though rare, side effects include:

* **Slow heart rate (bradycardia):**  This can be dangerous and needs immediate medical attention.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):**  Can cause dizziness or fainting.
* **Heart block:**  Disruption of the heart's electrical conduction system.
* **Asystole (brief cessation of heartbeat):** Extremely rare but a serious emergency.
* **Allergic reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions are possible.


**How it Works:** Adenosine is a naturally occurring nucleoside in the body that acts on the heart by slowing down the electrical conduction within the heart. It specifically targets the AV node (atrioventricular node), a critical area that regulates the heart's rhythm.  By temporarily blocking the AV node's conduction, it interrupts the abnormal electrical pathways responsible for certain tachycardias, allowing the heart to revert to a normal rhythm. The effect is very short-lived, typically lasting only a few seconds.

**FAQs:**

* **Is adenosine available in pill form?** No, adenosine is only available as a solution for intravenous injection.
* **Can I take adenosine at home?** No, adenosine must be administered and monitored by a healthcare professional in a medical setting due to the potential for serious side effects.
* **How long does the effect of adenosine last?** The effects are usually very short, lasting only seconds.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Inform the medical professional immediately.  They are prepared to manage any adverse reactions.
* **Is adenosine addictive?** No, adenosine is not an addictive substance.
* **Can adenosine be used to treat all types of rapid heartbeats?** No, it's primarily used to diagnose and treat specific types of supraventricular tachycardias.  It is ineffective against ventricular tachycardias.
* **Are there any precautions or contraindications?**  Yes, there are several contraindications, including certain heart conditions, asthma, and others. Your doctor will determine if adenosine is appropriate for you.
