# Aceclofenac 100mg  + Paracetamol 500mg  + Rabeprazole 10mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 500mg + Rabeprazole 10mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic pain
* Moderate to severe pain

The specific indication will be determined by a doctor.  Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) also reduces pain and fever. Rabeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces stomach acid production.  Including the PPI is intended to help protect the stomach lining from the potential ulcer-causing effects of NSAIDs like aceclofenac.

**Side Effects:**  Possible side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, drowsiness.
* **Less Common:**  Heartburn, flatulence,  rash, itching, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue (angioedema â€“ requires immediate medical attention).
* **Serious (though rare):**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), stomach ulcers, bleeding, kidney problems, liver damage, increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke).

This is not an exhaustive list. Consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Inhibits the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol:**  Reduces pain and fever through a mechanism that is not fully understood, but it may involve inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system.  It has less effect on peripheral COX enzymes than NSAIDs, leading to a lower risk of gastrointestinal side effects compared to aceclofenac alone.
* **Rabeprazole:** Reduces stomach acid production by inhibiting the proton pump in the parietal cells of the stomach lining.  This protects against the potential for NSAID-induced ulcers and gastritis.

The combination provides synergistic pain relief and aims to minimize the gastrointestinal side effects of the NSAID.
