# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 500mg + Serratiopeptidase 15mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 500mg + Serratiopeptidase 15mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, such as:

* **Osteoarthritis:** Pain and inflammation in the joints.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis:**  A chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints.
* **Post-surgical pain and inflammation:** Pain and swelling after surgery.
* **Dental pain:**  Pain associated with dental procedures.
* **Menstrual cramps:** Painful menstruation.
* **Other inflammatory conditions:**  As directed by a physician.

**Note:**  This medication is not a first-line treatment for all these conditions and should only be used under the guidance of a doctor.  Self-medication can be dangerous.


**Side Effects:**  Possible side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, indigestion, peptic ulcers (rare but serious), gastrointestinal bleeding (rare but serious).
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue (angioedema), difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis - a serious allergic reaction).
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Hepatic:** Liver damage (rare but serious - requires regular liver function tests).
* **Renal:** Kidney damage (rare but serious - requires regular kidney function tests).
* **Other:** Increased risk of bleeding, changes in blood counts, tinnitus (ringing in the ears).


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are chemicals in the body that cause pain, swelling, and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  A pain reliever and fever reducer that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs. Its exact mechanism is still not fully understood, but it is believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.
* **Serratiopeptidase:** A proteolytic enzyme that helps to break down proteins involved in inflammation and swelling.  It may help to reduce pain and improve tissue healing.

The combination of these three ingredients aims for a synergistic effect, providing more comprehensive pain relief and inflammation reduction compared to using each drug individually.
