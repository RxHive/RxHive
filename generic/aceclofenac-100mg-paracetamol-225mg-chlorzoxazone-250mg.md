It's crucial to understand that this medication is for *symptom relief* and does not cure the underlying condition.  A doctor should determine the cause of pain and recommend appropriate treatment.

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:** This combination medication works through the synergistic effects of its three components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic and antipyretic (pain reliever and fever reducer) that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs, reducing pain and fever.  The exact mechanism is not fully understood.
* **Chlorzoxazone:** A muscle relaxant that helps to relieve muscle spasms and pain by acting on the central nervous system.
