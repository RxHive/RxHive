# Aceclofenac 100mg + Tramadol 37.5mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Tramadol 37.5mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve moderate to severe pain, particularly pain associated with musculoskeletal conditions like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and post-surgical or post-traumatic pain.  Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation and pain, while Tramadol is an opioid analgesic that works on the central nervous system to relieve pain.  It's important to note that this is a prescription medication and should only be used as directed by a doctor.  It is not suitable for long-term use.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but can include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, indigestion, dry mouth.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), stomach ulcers or bleeding, liver or kidney problems, increased risk of bleeding, seizures (especially in those prone to seizures), slowed breathing (respiratory depression - more likely with higher doses of tramadol).
* **Other possible side effects:**  Constipation, changes in appetite, changes in mood, sweating, confusion, weakness.

This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult the medication leaflet or your doctor for a complete list.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or concerning side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Reduces inflammation and pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that contribute to inflammation and pain sensation.
* **Tramadol:**  Relieves pain primarily by binding to opioid receptors in the central nervous system, reducing the perception of pain. It also affects the release of serotonin and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters involved in pain signaling.  The combination provides a synergistic analgesic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of each drug's individual effects.
