# Aceclofenac + Paracetamol

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac + Paracetamol (various brand names exist)

**Usage:**  This combination drug is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and an analgesic used to relieve pain and inflammation. It's commonly prescribed for:

* Mild to moderate pain, such as headaches, muscle aches, back pain, and dental pain.
* Pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
* Post-surgical pain and pain following injury.
* Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea).


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Aceclofenac + Paracetamol can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  The frequency and severity vary. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, indigestion, heartburn.  More serious, though less common, gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers and bleeding can occur.
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Skin:** Rash, itching.
* **Liver:**  Rare cases of liver damage have been reported.
* **Kidney:**  Rare cases of kidney problems have been reported, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Rarely, serious allergic reactions such as angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat) or anaphylaxis can occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This is an NSAID that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic and antipyretic (fever reducer).  Its exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system, thus reducing pain and fever.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning that the combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects.  Aceclofenac addresses the inflammatory component of pain, while paracetamol tackles the pain itself.
