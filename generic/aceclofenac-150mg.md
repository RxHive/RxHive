**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, aceclofenac can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* Gastrointestinal problems:  Heartburn, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, ulcers (rare but serious), bleeding (rare but serious).
