# Adapalene 0.1% + Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%

**Generic Name:** Adapalene 0.1% + Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical treatment for acne vulgaris (acne). It's used to treat mild to moderate acne that includes pimples, whiteheads, and blackheads.  It's applied directly to the affected skin areas once daily, usually in the evening.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Never exceed the recommended dosage.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Skin Irritation:** Burning, stinging, redness, dryness, peeling, and scaling of the treated skin are frequent.  These are usually mild and temporary, but can be more pronounced initially.
* **Increased Sun Sensitivity:**  This combination can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight.  Use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, even on cloudy days, and avoid excessive sun exposure.
* **Dryness:**  The skin may become excessively dry, leading to cracking or flaking.  A moisturizer can help alleviate this.


Less common but more serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention:

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Symptoms such as rash, hives, itching, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, difficulty breathing should be reported immediately.
* **Severe Skin Irritation:**  If the irritation is severe or doesn't improve, discontinue use and consult your doctor.


**How it Works:**  This combination medication works through two different mechanisms:

* **Adapalene:** This is a retinoid, which means it's a derivative of vitamin A. It works by:
    * Unblocking pores (comedones)
    * Reducing inflammation
    * Increasing skin cell turnover, preventing the formation of new pimples.

* **Benzoyl Peroxide:** This is an antimicrobial agent that works by:
    * Killing acne-causing bacteria ( *Cutibacterium acnes*)
    * Reducing inflammation


The combination of these two active ingredients provides a synergistic effect, meaning they work better together than they would individually, resulting in more effective acne treatment.
