# Aceclofenac 1.5% w/w  + Capsaicin 0.01% w/w  + Methyl Salicylate 10% w/w  + Menthol 5% w/w

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 1.5% w/w + Capsaicin 0.01% w/w + Methyl Salicylate 10% w/w + Menthol 5% w/w  (This is a combination product, not a single generic name)


**Usage:** Topical analgesic for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue injuries.  It's typically applied to the affected area as directed on the product label.


**Side Effects:**  Because this is a combination of several active ingredients, side effects can be varied and depend on individual sensitivity.  Common side effects may include:

* **Local skin reactions:**  Burning, stinging, redness, itching, rash, swelling at the application site.
* **Allergic reactions:** In rare cases, more severe allergic reactions such as hives, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.
* **Systemic effects (less common but possible, especially with extensive application or compromised skin barrier):**  Headache, dizziness, nausea, stomach upset.


**How it Works:** This topical analgesic cream works through a combination of mechanisms:

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits the production of prostaglandins, which are involved in pain and inflammation.
* **Capsaicin:** A naturally occurring chemical found in chili peppers that depletes substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in pain signaling. This leads to a temporary desensitization to pain.  Initial application may cause a burning sensation.
* **Methyl Salicylate:** A counterirritant that produces a warming sensation, distracting from pain and potentially improving blood flow to the affected area.
* **Menthol:** A counterirritant that produces a cooling sensation, also acting as a local anesthetic, reducing pain and inflammation.
