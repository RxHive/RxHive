# Albendazole

**Generic Name:** Albendazole

**Usage:** Albendazole is an anthelmintic (antiworm) medication used to treat a variety of parasitic worm infections, including:

* **Nematode infections:**  This includes roundworm infections like ascariasis (roundworm), hookworm infections (ankylostomiasis), whipworm infections (trichuriasis), enterobiasis (pinworm), and strongyloidiasis.
* **Cestode infections:** This includes tapeworm infections such as taeniasis (tapeworm) and cysticercosis (tissue invasion by larval tapeworms).
* **Trematode infections:**  While less common, it can be used for some types of fluke infections (e.g., hydatid disease).

Specific dosages and treatment durations vary depending on the type and severity of the infection, and should always be prescribed and overseen by a doctor.  It's crucial to follow the physician's instructions precisely.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and are generally mild, but more serious side effects are possible.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Fever**
* **Fatigue**
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives (in rare cases, more severe allergic reactions can occur)

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Liver damage:**  Rare, but liver function tests should be monitored, especially with high doses or prolonged use.
* **Bone marrow suppression:**  Reduced production of blood cells, leading to anemia or decreased white blood cell count (rare).
* **Hair loss**
* **Neurological effects:**  Such as seizures (rare, typically associated with high doses or pre-existing conditions).

**How it Works:** Albendazole disrupts the worm's ability to absorb glucose, ultimately leading to the worm's death.  It interferes with the microtubules within the worm cells, affecting their function and metabolism.  This mechanism is effective against a broad spectrum of helminths.
