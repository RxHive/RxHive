# Aceclofenac 100mg  + Paracetamol 250mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 250mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and reduce fever.  It's often prescribed for mild to moderate pain associated with conditions such as:

* Headaches
* Toothaches
* Muscle aches
* Back pain
* Menstrual cramps
* Post-surgical pain
* Pain from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (though it's not a first-line treatment for these conditions and may only provide temporary relief)

**It is crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and duration of treatment as directed by a doctor.**  Do not exceed the recommended dose.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Aceclofenac + Paracetamol can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Indigestion
* Heartburn
* Abdominal pain
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)


**Less common but more serious side effects require immediate medical attention:**

* Severe stomach pain
* Bloody or black stools
* Jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes)
* Difficulty breathing
* Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat
* Allergic reactions with severe symptoms (anaphylaxis)


This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary from person to person.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's believed to work by affecting the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects.  Aceclofenac addresses the inflammatory component of pain, while Paracetamol helps manage the pain and fever.


**FAQs:**
