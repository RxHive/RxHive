# Acebrophylline 200mg + Desloratadine 5mg + Montelukast 10mg

It's crucial to understand that providing detailed medical information, including side effects and mechanisms of action, for a combination drug like Acebrophylline 200mg + Desloratadine 5mg + Montelukast 10mg, is beyond the scope of a large language model and could be dangerous.  **This information should only come from a qualified healthcare professional or the medication's official prescribing information.**  Self-treating based on information found online can be harmful.

However, I can provide a *general* overview based on the individual components.  This is for informational purposes only and should *not* be used for self-diagnosis or treatment.

**Generic Name:**  This is a fixed-dose combination with three active ingredients:

* **Acebrophylline:** A bronchodilator (relaxes airways).
* **Desloratadine:** An antihistamine (reduces allergy symptoms).
* **Montelukast:** A leukotriene receptor antagonist (blocks inflammatory substances).


**Usage:**  This combination is likely used to treat symptoms of respiratory conditions like asthma or allergic bronchitis, potentially targeting bronchoconstriction, inflammation, and allergic reactions.  The specific indication would be determined by a doctor based on individual patient needs.


**Side Effects:**  Possible side effects vary depending on the individual and the specific ingredient.  Common side effects for each component *individually* can include:

* **Acebrophylline:**  Headache, nervousness, insomnia, nausea, upset stomach.  More serious side effects are possible.
* **Desloratadine:**  Drowsiness, headache, fatigue, dry mouth.
* **Montelukast:**  Headache, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain.  Rare but serious side effects are possible.

**This is not an exhaustive list.**  The combination's side effects profile could be different and more complex.


**How it Works:**

* **Acebrophylline:** Relaxes the muscles around the airways, making breathing easier.
* **Desloratadine:** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released during allergic reactions, reducing symptoms like sneezing, itching, and runny nose.
* **Montelukast:** Blocks leukotrienes, inflammatory substances that contribute to airway narrowing and inflammation.


**FAQs:**

Because this is a triple combination, FAQs would be very specific to an individual's situation and should be discussed with a doctor.  A doctor will consider the patient's medical history, other medications, and potential drug interactions before prescribing this combination.
