# Acitretin 20mg

**Generic Name:** Acitretin

**Usage:**

Acitretin is a retinoid medication primarily used to treat severe, chronic forms of psoriasis and other severe skin conditions such as severe acne (particularly nodulocystic acne) that haven't responded to other treatments.  It's also used in some cases of ichthyosis (a group of skin disorders characterized by dry, scaly skin).  It's a potent medication and is generally only prescribed when other treatments have failed.  The prescribing physician will determine the appropriate dosage and duration of treatment.


**Side Effects:**

Acitretin can cause a wide range of side effects, some mild and others serious.  These can include:

* **Common side Effects:** Dryness of the skin, mucous membranes (lips, mouth, nose), and eyes; peeling skin; inflammation of the lips (cheilitis); itching; headache; nausea; diarrhea; muscle or joint pain; increased levels of cholesterol or triglycerides.
* **Serious Side Effects:**  Liver damage (hepatotoxicity);  bone and muscle pain (often requiring discontinuation of treatment); increased risk of infections;  severe skin reactions;  elevated blood lipid levels; increased risk of depression;  hair loss;  eye irritation;  inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis);  and birth defects (extremely serious â€“ see FAQs).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Acitretin is **teratogenic**, meaning it can cause severe birth defects.  Women of childbearing age must use highly effective contraception for at least three years after stopping treatment. Pregnancy tests are typically required before, during, and after treatment. Breastfeeding is contraindicated during treatment.

**How it Works:**

Acitretin is a retinoid, meaning it's a derivative of vitamin A.  It works by regulating cell growth and differentiation, particularly in the skin. This helps to reduce the rapid turnover of skin cells characteristic of psoriasis and other conditions it treats.  The exact mechanisms aren't fully understood but involve interactions with nuclear receptors in skin cells.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Acitretin habit-forming?** No, acitretin is not considered habit-forming.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The effects of acitretin may not be noticeable for several weeks.  Improvement is usually gradual.
* **What are the long-term effects?**  Long-term use can increase the risk of some of the side effects mentioned above, particularly bone and muscle pain, and lipid abnormalities. Regular monitoring of blood work is necessary.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Acitretin?**  Alcohol can exacerbate some of the side effects, such as liver problems.  Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.
* **Can I take other medications with Acitretin?**  Some medications can interact with acitretin. It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Particular care must be taken with Vitamin A and other retinoids.
* **What about pregnancy?**  **Acitretin is extremely dangerous during pregnancy, causing severe birth defects.** Women of childbearing age must use effective contraception (two reliable methods) for at least three years after stopping treatment.  Pregnancy tests are mandatory.
* **How is Acitretin stopped?**  Acitretin should never be stopped abruptly.  Your doctor will gradually reduce the dosage to minimize potential withdrawal symptoms or rebound effects.
