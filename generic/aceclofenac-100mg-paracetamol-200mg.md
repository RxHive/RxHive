# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 200mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 200mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation (swelling) caused by various conditions such as:

* Mild to moderate pain (e.g., headaches, muscle aches, back pain, dental pain, menstrual cramps)
* Osteoarthritis (pain and inflammation in the joints)
* Rheumatoid arthritis (a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints)
* Ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis affecting the spine)
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic pain


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Aceclofenac + Paracetamol can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Some common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, heartburn, indigestion, peptic ulcers (rare but serious)
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia
* **Skin:** Rash, itching, hives
* **Other:**  Fluid retention, increased liver enzymes (rare), allergic reactions (rare but potentially serious)


**Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention:**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) â€“ symptoms include swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat; difficulty breathing; and a rapid heartbeat.
* Severe stomach pain
* Black, tarry stools or bloody vomit (signs of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract)
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).  Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning they work together to provide better pain relief than either drug alone. Aceclofenac targets inflammation, while Paracetamol manages pain.
