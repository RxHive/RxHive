# Acebrophylline 50mg/5ml

**Generic Name:** Acebrophylline

**Usage:**

Acebrophylline is a bronchodilator used to treat reversible airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and in asthma. It relaxes the muscles in the airways of the lungs, making it easier to breathe.  It's typically used as a maintenance medication, meaning it's taken regularly to prevent symptoms rather than to treat an acute attack.  It's often used in combination with other medications, especially inhaled corticosteroids. The 50mg/5ml concentration suggests this is a liquid formulation, likely a syrup, for easier administration, especially to children or those with difficulty swallowing tablets.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* Headaches
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Nervousness
* Tremors
* Palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat)
* Increased urination

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Seizures (rare, especially at higher doses)
* Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)
* Worsening of existing heart conditions
* Severe allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)


**How it Works:**

Acebrophylline is a methylxanthine derivative.  It works by relaxing the smooth muscles in the bronchioles (small airways in the lungs), thus widening the airways and improving airflow.  It achieves this by inhibiting the action of phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic AMP (cAMP), a molecule that promotes muscle relaxation.  By increasing cAMP levels, acebrophylline leads to bronchodilation.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take acebrophylline with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting acebrophylline.  Interactions can occur, particularly with certain cardiac medications, diuretics, and lithium.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action can vary, but you may start to feel relief within a short time after taking it, though the full effect may take longer.
* **Q: Can I suddenly stop taking acebrophylline?** A: No.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and discontinuation.  Stopping abruptly can lead to worsening symptoms.  Your doctor will likely recommend a gradual tapering of the dose.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to catch up.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, particularly those listed above as less common but serious.
* **Q: Is acebrophylline addictive?** A:  Acebrophylline is not considered addictive in the same way as opioids.  However, prolonged use can lead to tolerance, meaning you might need a higher dose to achieve the same effect.  This underscores the importance of following your doctorâ€™s prescribed dosage.
* **Q: Is acebrophylline safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  Consult your doctor before taking acebrophylline if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  The safety profile during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.
