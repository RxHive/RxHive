# Acitretin 25mg

**Generic Name:** Acitretin

**Usage:** Acitretin is a retinoid medication primarily used to treat severe forms of psoriasis (a chronic skin condition causing skin inflammation and scaling) and severe acne (characterized by inflamed, pus-filled pimples and potentially scarring). It's typically reserved for cases that haven't responded adequately to other treatments.  It's important to note that it's not a first-line treatment for these conditions.

**Side Effects:** Acitretin can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others serious.  These can include:

* **Common:** Dry skin, lips, and mucous membranes; peeling skin; itching; headache; nausea; diarrhea; nosebleeds; increased sensitivity to sunlight; hair thinning; inflammation of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); muscle and joint pain.
* **Serious (require immediate medical attention):** Liver inflammation (hepatitis); pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas); bone and muscle pain; increased cholesterol and triglycerides; pseudotumor cerebri (increased pressure in the brain); depression; suicidal thoughts; birth defects (teratogenic effects â€“ see FAQs).
* **Other possible side effects:**  Changes in skin pigmentation,  dry eyes,  inflammation of the mouth,  increased susceptibility to infections.

The severity and frequency of side effects vary from person to person.  It is crucial to report any unusual or concerning symptoms to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Acitretin is a retinoid, meaning it's related to vitamin A.  It works by slowing the growth of skin cells, reducing inflammation, and decreasing the production of sebum (oil) in the skin. This helps to control the symptoms of psoriasis and acne. The exact mechanisms are complex and not fully understood.

**FAQs:**

* **Is Acitretin safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?**  No, Acitretin is highly teratogenic, meaning it can cause severe birth defects.  Women of childbearing age must use highly effective contraception (two reliable methods simultaneously) for at least 3 years after stopping treatment. Pregnancy tests are mandatory before, during, and after treatment.  Breastfeeding is contraindicated while taking acitretin.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The effects of acitretin may not be noticeable immediately. It usually takes several weeks to see improvement, and treatment is often long-term.
* **What are the potential drug interactions?** Acitretin can interact with many other medications, including vitamin A supplements, tetracyclines, and alcohol.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double up on doses.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Acitretin?**  Alcohol consumption should be minimized or avoided completely while on acitretin, as it can increase the risk of liver damage.
* **What are the long-term effects?**  Long-term use can increase the risk of certain side effects, including bone thinning and liver problems. Regular monitoring by a doctor is essential.
