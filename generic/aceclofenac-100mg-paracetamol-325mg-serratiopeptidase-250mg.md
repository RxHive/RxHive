**It is crucial to consult a doctor before using this medication and to follow their prescribed dosage and duration of treatment.**  Self-medication can be harmful. This information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

**Side Effects:**  The side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage. Some common side effects include:

This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects may occur. If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and consult a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** A pain reliever and fever reducer. Its exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.
* **Serratiopeptidase:** A proteolytic enzyme derived from a bacteria found in the silkworm gut. It is believed to help reduce inflammation and swelling by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory process.  Its effectiveness in humans is still under research and clinical evidence is not conclusive for all applications.
