**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's thought to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system, reducing pain signals.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a stronger analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect than either drug alone.
