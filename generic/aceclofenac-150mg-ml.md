**Side Effects:** Like other NSAIDs, aceclofenac can cause several side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, ulcers, bleeding (in rare cases).

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary between individuals.  Always consult a doctor if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:** Aceclofenac works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, aceclofenac helps to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.
