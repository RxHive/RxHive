**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, acalabrutinib can cause side effects.  Some common side effects include:

* **Frequent:** Diarrhea, fatigue, headache, nausea, bruising, upper respiratory tract infection, cough.
* **Less Frequent but Potentially Serious:**  Bleeding (including nosebleeds, easy bruising, and gastrointestinal bleeding), atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat), pneumonia, hypertension (high blood pressure), and serious infections.
* **Rare but Serious:**  Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells), tumor lysis syndrome (a complication related to the rapid breakdown of cancer cells), and other serious adverse events.


This is not a complete list of side effects.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.


**How it Works:** Acalabrutinib is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. BTK is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the signaling pathways of certain immune cells, including B cells.  In many blood cancers, these B cells are cancerous and contribute to the disease's progression.  Acalabrutinib works by blocking the activity of BTK, thereby inhibiting the growth and survival of these cancerous B cells.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is acalabrutinib a chemotherapy drug?** A: No, acalabrutinib is a targeted therapy, not a chemotherapy drug.  Targeted therapies work by selectively targeting specific molecules involved in cancer growth, unlike chemotherapy, which generally targets rapidly dividing cells throughout the body.

* **Q: How is acalabrutinib administered?** A: Acalabrutinib is usually taken orally (by mouth) as a tablet.

* **Q: What are the precautions I should take while taking acalabrutinib?** A:  You should inform your doctor about all your medical conditions, including any bleeding disorders or history of heart problems.  Regular monitoring of blood counts and heart function may be necessary. Avoid activities that increase the risk of bleeding or injury.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking acalabrutinib?** A: It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.  Alcohol may interact with the medication or exacerbate some side effects.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  Generally, it's recommended not to take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
