# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Cetirizine 10mg + Phenylephrine 5mg + Caffeine 25mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Cetirizine 10mg + Phenylephrine 5mg + Caffeine 25mg  (This is a combination drug, not a single generic name.)


**Usage:** This combination drug is typically used to provide symptomatic relief from the common cold and flu, and other conditions causing similar symptoms.  The specific actions of each component contribute to this effect:

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to reduce pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).
* **Cetirizine:** An antihistamine to relieve allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant to relieve nasal congestion.
* **Caffeine:** A stimulant to increase alertness and potentially enhance the effects of other ingredients.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and may include:

* **Aceclofenac related:** Stomach upset (nausea, heartburn, indigestion),  constipation, diarrhea, headache, dizziness,  fluid retention, increased risk of bleeding, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).  More serious, though rare, side effects include kidney problems, liver damage, and cardiovascular problems (high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke).
* **Paracetamol related:** Liver damage (with overdose), allergic reactions.
* **Cetirizine related:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, fatigue.
* **Phenylephrine related:**  Increased blood pressure, nervousness, insomnia, headache.
* **Caffeine related:**  Restlessness, nervousness, insomnia, palpitations, headache.


**How it Works:** Each component works through a different mechanism:

* **Aceclofenac:** Inhibits the production of prostaglandins, which cause pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol:** Reduces fever by affecting the area of the brain that regulates body temperature, and its pain-relieving mechanism isn't fully understood but is thought to involve inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system.
* **Cetirizine:** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released during allergic reactions.
* **Phenylephrine:**  Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Caffeine:** Acts as a central nervous system stimulant, potentially enhancing the effects of other components and counteracting the drowsiness of some other ingredients.
