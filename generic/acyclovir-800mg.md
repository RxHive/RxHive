# Acyclovir 800mg

**Generic Name:** Acyclovir

**Usage:** Acyclovir 800mg tablets are an antiviral medication used to treat infections caused by herpes viruses, including:

* **Genital herpes:**  Reduces the frequency and duration of outbreaks.  It does *not* cure genital herpes.
* **Shingles (herpes zoster):** Reduces pain and speeds healing of the rash.
* **Chickenpox (varicella):** Shortens the duration and severity of the illness, especially in immunocompromised individuals.
* **Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE):** A serious brain infection caused by herpes simplex virus.
* **Other herpes simplex virus infections:**  Such as cold sores (oral herpes).  Treatment may not always be necessary for cold sores.

Acyclovir is *not* effective against all viruses.  It only works against certain herpes viruses.  The dosage and duration of treatment will vary depending on the specific infection and the patient's health status.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.


**Side Effects:**  Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Rash

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Kidney problems (especially with high doses or in patients with pre-existing kidney disease)
* Seizures
* Confusion
* Tremors
* Anemia
* Liver problems


**How it Works:** Acyclovir is a nucleoside analogue.  This means it mimics a building block of DNA and RNA.  When the herpes virus attempts to replicate its genetic material, it incorporates acyclovir into its DNA.  This inhibits the further replication of the virus, slowing its spread and reducing the severity of the infection.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Acyclovir a cure for herpes?** No, acyclovir does not cure herpes. It manages symptoms and reduces the frequency and severity of outbreaks.  The herpes virus remains dormant in the body even after treatment.

* **Can I take Acyclovir without a prescription?** No, you should only take Acyclovir under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  They will determine the appropriate dosage and duration of treatment based on your specific condition and health.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.

* **What are the drug interactions?** Acyclovir can interact with other medications, so it's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **What are the precautions?** Patients with kidney problems should be particularly cautious as acyclovir can be hard on the kidneys.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before taking acyclovir.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Acyclovir?**  Generally, moderate alcohol consumption shouldn't pose a problem, but it's best to discuss this with your doctor. Excessive alcohol consumption can stress the liver and kidneys, which are already potentially affected by Acyclovir.
