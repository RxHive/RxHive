# Aceclofenac 1.50% w/w + Linseed Oil 3% w/w + Methyl Salicylate 10% w/w + Menthol 5% w/w + Capsaicin 0.01% w/w

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 1.50% w/w + Linseed Oil 3% w/w + Methyl Salicylate 10% w/w + Menthol 5% w/w + Capsaicin 0.01% w/w Topical Gel/Cream (Note: This is a combination product; there isn't a single generic name encompassing all ingredients).

**Usage:** This topical formulation is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as:

* Arthritis (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis)
* Back pain
* Muscle strains and sprains
* Soft tissue injuries

It's applied directly to the affected area of the skin as directed by a doctor or pharmacist.  The exact dosage and frequency will vary depending on individual needs and the specific product.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site but can include:

* **Skin irritation:** Redness, burning, itching, rash, swelling.  This is the most common side effect.
* **Allergic reactions:** In rare cases, more severe allergic reactions can occur.  Stop use and seek medical attention if you experience symptoms such as hives, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
* **Systemic effects:** While rare with topical application, absorption into the bloodstream can occur, potentially leading to side effects similar to those seen with oral NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as gastrointestinal upset (nausea, indigestion), headache, dizziness.

**How it Works:** This combination product works through a multi-pronged approach:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Linseed Oil:** A natural emollient that softens and soothes the skin, potentially aiding in pain relief.
* **Methyl Salicylate:** A counterirritant that produces a warming sensation, distracting from pain and potentially increasing blood flow to the affected area.
* **Menthol:**  A counterirritant that produces a cooling sensation, providing temporary pain relief.
* **Capsaicin:**  A naturally occurring substance from chili peppers; it works by depleting substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in pain signaling. This leads to a temporary reduction in pain perception, although initial application may cause a burning sensation.
