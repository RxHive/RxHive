# Abiraterone Acetate 500mg

**Generic Name:** Abiraterone Acetate

**Usage:** Abiraterone acetate is used to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer or mCRPC).  It's typically used in combination with prednisone or prednisolone (corticosteroids).  It is used *after* other hormone therapies have stopped working.  It's important to note that this medication is a prescription drug and should only be used under the guidance of a physician.

**Side Effects:** Abiraterone acetate can cause a variety of side effects, some common and some serious.  These can include:

* **Common:**  High blood pressure, swelling in legs and ankles (edema), hot flashes, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, dizziness, increased levels of "bad" cholesterol (LDL), low levels of "good" cholesterol (HDL).
* **Serious:**  Fluid retention (which can lead to heart failure), low potassium levels (hypokalemia), liver problems (including hepatitis and jaundice), increased risk of blood clots,  increased risk of infections,  high blood pressure, heart rhythm problems.
* **Rare but serious:**  QT interval prolongation (heart rhythm disturbance).


It's crucial to report any side effects to your doctor immediately, especially if they are severe or persistent.  The complete list of possible side effects is extensive and can be found in the medication's package insert.

**How it Works:** Abiraterone acetate is a CYP17 enzyme inhibitor.  Prostate cancer cells often rely on hormones like testosterone for growth.  Abiraterone blocks the production of testosterone and other steroid hormones in the adrenal glands and testes, thus depriving the cancer cells of their fuel and helping to slow or stop their growth.  The combination with prednisone/prednisolone further helps manage hormone levels.
