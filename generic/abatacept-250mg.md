# Abatacept 250mg

**Generic Name:** Abatacept

**Usage:** Abatacept is used to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  It may be used alone or in combination with other medications.  Specifically:

* **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):**  Reduces the signs and symptoms of RA and slows the progression of joint damage.
* **Psoriatic Arthritis:** Reduces the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis, including joint inflammation and skin lesions.
* **Ankylosing Spondylitis:** Reduces the signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, including back pain and stiffness.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, abatacept can cause side effects. Some common side effects include:

* **Upper respiratory infections:** Such as colds and the flu.
* **Headache:**  Can range from mild to moderate.
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to your stomach.
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling unusually tired.
* **Injection site reactions:**  Pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site.
* **Increased risk of infections:** Abatacept weakens the immune system, making you more susceptible to infections.


**Serious, but less common side effects include:**

* **Serious infections:**  Including pneumonia, sepsis, and tuberculosis.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Such as hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, and difficulty breathing.
* **Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML):** A rare but serious brain infection.


**How it Works:** Abatacept is a selective T-cell co-stimulation modulator.  It works by blocking the interaction between T cells (a type of white blood cell) and other immune cells.  This interaction is crucial for the inflammation associated with these autoimmune diseases.  By blocking this interaction, abatacept reduces the inflammation and improves symptoms.  It doesn't completely suppress the immune system, but rather selectively targets the cells involved in the autoimmune process.
