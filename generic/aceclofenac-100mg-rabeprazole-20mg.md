# Aceclofenac 100mg + Rabeprazole 20mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Rabeprazole 20mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  The aceclofenac component is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation.  The rabeprazole component is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces stomach acid production.  The rabeprazole is included to help protect the stomach lining from the potential ulcer-causing effects of aceclofenac.  It's crucial to use this medication *exactly* as prescribed by a doctor.  It's not for long-term use without ongoing medical supervision.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Common:** Headache, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, flatulence, dizziness,  sleepiness.
* **Less Common:**  Vomiting, heartburn, dry mouth, skin rash, itching.
* **Serious (requires immediate medical attention):**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), stomach ulcers or bleeding (black, tarry stools, bloody vomit), liver problems (jaundice, dark urine), kidney problems (changes in urination), heart problems (chest pain, shortness of breath).  This list isn't exhaustive.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This NSAID works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Rabeprazole:** This PPI reduces stomach acid production by blocking the "proton pump," an enzyme in the stomach lining responsible for acid secretion. This protective effect minimizes the risk of gastrointestinal complications associated with NSAIDs like aceclofenac.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  A:  It's generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking this medication, as alcohol can increase the risk of stomach upset and bleeding, especially in combination with NSAIDs.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medicines?** A:  This is crucial.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking, as interactions are possible.  Certain drugs, such as anticoagulants (blood thinners), can have dangerous interactions with this medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How long will it take to feel the effects?** A: The pain-relieving effects of aceclofenac usually begin within a few hours, but it may take several days to reach full effectiveness.

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No,  it's important to gradually reduce the dosage as directed by your doctor before stopping the medication completely to avoid potential withdrawal symptoms or rebound effects.

* **Q:  What are the long-term risks of using this medication?** A: Long-term use of NSAIDs increases the risk of cardiovascular problems (heart attack, stroke), kidney damage, and gastrointestinal complications. Prolonged use of PPIs can also lead to increased risk of bone fractures and infections like *Clostridium difficile*. Regular monitoring by your doctor is necessary if you need to use this medication for an extended period.
