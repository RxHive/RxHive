# Aceclofenac 60mg + Thiocolchicoside 4mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 60mg + Thiocolchicoside 4mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Acute musculoskeletal pain (e.g., back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain)

It's important to note that this medication treats symptoms, not the underlying cause of the condition.  Always consult a doctor to determine the appropriate use and dosage for your specific needs.  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Aceclofenac 60mg + Thiocolchicoside 4mg can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, indigestion, heartburn
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia
* **Other:** Skin rash, itching, swelling (angioedema â€“ rare but serious), increased liver enzymes (detected through blood tests)

**Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention. These can include:**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Stomach ulcers or bleeding
* Liver or kidney problems
* Severe skin reactions

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary from person to person.  Consult the patient information leaflet or your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Thiocolchicoside:** This is a muscle relaxant that helps to relieve muscle spasms and stiffness.  The exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to affect the release of neurotransmitters involved in muscle contraction.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Thiocolchicoside provides both anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxant effects, offering more comprehensive pain relief for musculoskeletal conditions.
