# Albendazole 200mg + Levamisole 50mg

**Generic Name:** Albendazole 200mg + Levamisole 50mg

**Usage:** This combination is primarily used to treat various parasitic worm infections (helminthiasis), specifically targeting nematodes (roundworms) and some cestodes (tapeworms).  The specific infections treated may vary by region and the prescribing physician's judgment.  Common uses include treating:

* **Hookworm infections:**  Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale
* **Roundworm infections:** Ascaris lumbricoides
* **Whipworm infections:** Trichuris trichiura
* **Strongyloidiasis:** Strongyloides stercoralis (often requires a longer course of treatment)

**It's crucial to note:** This medication is a prescription drug.  The specific dosage, duration of treatment, and suitability for an individual patient must be determined by a doctor based on the type of infection, the patient's age, weight, and overall health.  Self-medication is dangerous and can lead to treatment failure or serious complications.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Elevated liver enzymes (detected through blood tests)
* Rash
* Fever

More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* Severe liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Bone marrow suppression (leading to decreased blood cell counts)
* Hair loss
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a rare but severe skin reaction)

**How it Works:**

Albendazole and levamisole are both anthelmintics, meaning they kill or impair parasitic worms. They work through different mechanisms:

* **Albendazole:** Interferes with the worm's ability to absorb glucose, leading to its death or expulsion from the body.  It affects the worm's microtubules, which are crucial for its function.

* **Levamisole:** Stimulates the immune system to attack the worms, enhancing the effectiveness of albendazole.  It also has a direct anthelmintic effect by paralyzing certain types of worms.

The combination of these two drugs provides broader spectrum coverage and potentially increased efficacy against various parasitic infections.
