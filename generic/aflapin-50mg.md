It's crucial to understand that I cannot provide specific medical advice or details about medications, including "Aflapin 50mg," without knowing the exact active ingredient.  "Aflapin" is not a globally recognized generic name; it's likely a brand name or a name used in a specific region.  The 50mg refers to the dosage, but the crucial information is the *active ingredient*.  The drug's effects and side effects depend entirely on that ingredient.

For example, a medication called "Aflapin 50mg" in one country might contain a different active ingredient than a medication with the same name in another country.  This means the information below will be *generic* and cannot be applied to "Aflapin 50mg" without knowing its active ingredient.  **Always consult your doctor or pharmacist for information specific to your medication.**
