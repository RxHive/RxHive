**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac and Paracetamol Oral Suspension

**Important Note:** This information is for general knowledge and does not substitute professional medical advice.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before using this medication, especially if you have pre-existing conditions or are taking other medications. The dosage and duration of treatment should be determined by a healthcare professional.  This combination may not be suitable for all conditions and ages.


**Side Effects:**  Aceclofenac and Paracetamol can cause various side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, heartburn, constipation
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (rare but serious)
* **Other:** Increased liver enzyme levels (rare), changes in blood counts (rare)

**Serious side effects are rare but require immediate medical attention.** These can include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers
* Liver damage
* Kidney problems


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) that works through a different mechanism, reducing fever by acting on the hypothalamus in the brain and potentially affecting prostaglandin production in the central nervous system.

The combination of aceclofenac and paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning their combined action is greater than the sum of their individual effects, offering better pain and fever relief.
