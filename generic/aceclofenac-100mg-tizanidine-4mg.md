# Aceclofenac 100mg + Tizanidine 4mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Tizanidine 4mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and muscle spasm associated with musculoskeletal conditions like:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Acute musculoskeletal injuries (sprains, strains)
* Post-surgical pain and inflammation


**Important Note:** This medication is a prescription drug and should only be used under the guidance of a doctor.  The dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and condition. Self-medication is strongly discouraged.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include, but are not limited to:

* **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia, dry mouth.
* **Less Common Side Effects:**  Increased liver enzymes (detected through blood tests), skin rash, itching,  swelling, heartburn.
* **Serious Side Effects (require immediate medical attention):**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis),  severe liver problems (jaundice, dark urine, pale stools),  severe gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration,  worsening of heart failure, blood disorders.

This is not an exhaustive list of side effects.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for complete details and to report any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause pain, swelling, and inflammation.
* **Tizanidine:** This is a muscle relaxant that works by acting on the central nervous system to reduce muscle spasms and stiffness.

The combination of aceclofenac and tizanidine provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects of each drug. This allows for effective management of both pain and muscle spasms.
