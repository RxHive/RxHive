# Aceclofenac 200mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Serratiopeptidase 15mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 200mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Serratiopeptidase 15mg

**Usage:** This combination drug is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic pain and inflammation
* Menstrual cramps
* Dental pain
* Other musculoskeletal pain


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, peptic ulcers (rare but serious).
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Cardiovascular:**  Increased risk of heart attack or stroke (especially with long-term use).  Increased blood pressure.

* **Renal:** Impaired kidney function (especially in patients with pre-existing kidney problems).
* **Other:**  Fluid retention, changes in blood counts.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is believed to reduce fever by affecting the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that regulates body temperature. It also acts on pain pathways in the central nervous system.

* **Serratiopeptidase:** This is a proteolytic enzyme (breaks down proteins).  It's believed to reduce inflammation and edema (swelling) by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory process.  However, the effectiveness of serratiopeptidase in humans is still debated and requires further research.
