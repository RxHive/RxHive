# Aceclofenac 100mcg  + Paracetamol 325mg  + Serratiopeptidase 15mg

It's important to note that a 100mcg dose of Aceclofenac is unusually low.  Aceclofenac is typically prescribed at doses of 100mg, not mcg (micrograms).  A 100mcg dose is likely a typographical error.  The information below assumes the Aceclofenac dose is 100mg, not 100mcg.  **Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication.**  Misinterpreting dosages can be extremely dangerous.


**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Serratiopeptidase 15mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Post-surgical inflammation and pain
* Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea)
* Other sources of mild to moderate pain and inflammation

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and the duration of use. Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, heartburn, constipation, diarrhea, ulceration (rare but serious).
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (in severe cases â€“ seek immediate medical attention).
* **Nervous system:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness.
* **Liver:** Liver enzyme elevation (rare, requires monitoring).
* **Kidney:** Kidney problems (rare, especially in pre-existing kidney conditions).
* **Other:**  Fluid retention, increased blood pressure (less common).

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac (100mg):** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (325mg):** An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.
* **Serratiopeptidase (15mg):** A proteolytic enzyme derived from a bacterium found in silkworm intestines.  It's believed to help reduce inflammation and swelling by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory process. It may also help to reduce pain by decreasing the viscosity of mucus and facilitating drainage in tissues.
