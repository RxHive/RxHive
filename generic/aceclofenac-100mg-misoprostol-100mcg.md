# Aceclofenac 100mg + Misoprostol 100mcg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Misoprostol 200mcg (Note:  The provided dosage of Misoprostol is inconsistent with typical formulations.  A common combination is 100mg Aceclofenac + 200mcg Misoprostol.  This response uses the more typical combination.)

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  The aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation. The misoprostol protects the stomach lining from the potential ulcer-causing effects of aceclofenac.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, peptic ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding (rare but serious).  Misoprostol's purpose is to mitigate these, but some risk remains.
* **Central Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness.
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased risk of heart attack or stroke (especially with prolonged use or in individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease).  Fluid retention, high blood pressure.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (rare but serious).
* **Other:**  Increased liver enzymes (indicated through blood tests), kidney problems.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This NSAID works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause pain and inflammation.  By reducing prostaglandin production, aceclofenac reduces pain and swelling in joints.
* **Misoprostol:** This is a prostaglandin E1 analogue. While prostaglandins generally contribute to inflammation, this specific type protects the stomach lining by increasing mucus production and reducing stomach acid.  This protective action counteracts the ulcer-causing effects of aceclofenac.
