# Alendronic Acid 35mg

**Generic Name:** Alendronic Acid

**Usage:**

Alendronic acid is used to treat and prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at increased risk of fractures.  It's also used to treat Paget's disease of bone and to treat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.  The specific indication will be determined by a doctor based on individual patient needs.  It increases bone mass density, reducing the risk of fractures.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and regimen carefully.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** These are the most frequent, including heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and esophageal irritation or ulcers (a serious side effect).
* **Musculoskeletal pain:** Muscle, joint, or bone pain.
* **Headache:**  Can occur in some patients.

Less common but serious side effects include:

* **Esophageal ulcers and perforation:**  This is a serious complication and necessitates immediate medical attention.  Proper administration is crucial to minimize this risk (see "How it Works" section for details).
* **Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ):**  A rare but severe complication affecting the jawbone, particularly in patients with dental problems or those undergoing dental procedures.
* **Atypical femoral fractures:**  Stress fractures of the thigh bone that occur unexpectedly.
* **Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium):**  Can occur, especially in patients with vitamin D deficiency.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Rare but potentially life-threatening.

This is not an exhaustive list, and individual experiences can vary.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list and to discuss any concerns.


**How it Works:**

Alendronic acid is a bisphosphonate.  It works by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for breaking down bone tissue. By slowing bone resorption (breakdown), alendronic acid allows for the increase in bone mass density over time.  This strengthened bone mass reduces the risk of fractures.

**Crucially:**  To minimize the risk of esophageal irritation and ulcers, alendronic acid tablets must be taken:

* **First thing in the morning,** at least 30 minutes before food, drink, or other medications.
* **With a full glass (6-8 ounces) of plain water.**
* **The patient must remain upright (sitting or standing) for at least 30 minutes after taking the medication.**  Lying down increases the risk of esophageal irritation.


**FAQs:**

* **How long do I need to take alendronic acid?**  The duration of treatment depends on your individual condition and will be determined by your doctor.
* **Can I take alendronic acid with other medications?**  You should inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions may occur.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Do not take a double dose.  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, but only if it's still within several hours of the scheduled time. If it is later, skip the missed dose and resume your regular schedule.
* **What are the dietary restrictions?**  No specific dietary restrictions are usually required, but a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D is recommended for optimal bone health.
* **Can I take alendronic acid if I have kidney problems?**  Your doctor will need to assess your kidney function before prescribing alendronic acid, as dosage adjustments might be necessary.
* **Are there alternative treatments for osteoporosis?**  Yes, other medications and lifestyle modifications are available; discuss these options with your doctor.
