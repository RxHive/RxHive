# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 323mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 323mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and reduce fever and inflammation.  It's often prescribed for conditions such as:

* Mild to moderate pain (e.g., headaches, toothaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps)
* Fever
* Osteoarthritis pain
* Rheumatoid arthritis pain
* Post-surgical pain

**Important Note:**  This medication is not a suitable treatment for all types of pain. Always consult a doctor before using this or any medication to determine if it is appropriate for your specific condition.  Self-treating can be dangerous.


**Side Effects:** Like all medications, Aceclofenac + Paracetamol can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Indigestion
* Heartburn
* Stomach pain
* Dizziness
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Skin rash
* Allergic reactions (rare but serious, potentially including swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)

More serious, but less common side effects include:

* Liver damage
* Kidney damage
* Gastric ulcers
* Bleeding in the stomach or intestines
* Increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke) â€“ particularly with long-term use


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body.

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).  Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system, thereby reducing fever and pain perception.


The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects.  This allows for effective pain and fever relief with potentially lower doses of each individual drug, minimizing the risk of side effects.
