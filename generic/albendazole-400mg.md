# Albendazole 400mg

**Generic Name:** Albendazole

**Usage:** Albendazole is an anthelmintic (antiworm) medication used to treat various parasitic worm infestations, including:

* **Neurocysticercosis:**  A parasitic infection of the brain caused by the larval stage of the pork tapeworm ( *Taenia solium*).  This is often a serious condition requiring close medical supervision.
* **Hydatid disease (echinococcosis):**  An infection caused by the larval stage of the *Echinococcus* tapeworm.  Treatment often involves surgery in conjunction with albendazole.
* **Ascariasis:**  Infection with roundworms (*Ascaris lumbricoides*).
* **Hookworm infection:** Infection with hookworms (*Necator americanus* and *Ancylostoma duodenale*).
* **Trichuriasis (whipworm infection):** Infection with whipworms (*Trichuris trichiura*).
* **Strongyloidiasis:** Infection with threadworms (*Strongyloides stercoralis*).
* **Enterobiasis (pinworm infection):** Infection with pinworms (*Enterobius vermicularis*).  Albendazole is sometimes used, though other medications are often preferred.
* **Toxocariasis:** Infection with *Toxocara* roundworms.


**Important Note:** The specific usage and dosage of albendazole will vary greatly depending on the type of infection, the severity of the infection, the patient's age and weight, and other factors.  **Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.**  Do not self-medicate.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects of albendazole include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Elevated liver enzymes (detected through blood tests)

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Bone marrow suppression (reduced production of blood cells)
* Liver damage
* Hair loss
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Seizures (rare, but more likely in patients with pre-existing conditions)


**How it Works:** Albendazole interferes with the ability of parasitic worms to absorb glucose, essentially starving them and leading to their death and expulsion from the body.  The exact mechanisms are complex and involve multiple targets within the worm's cells.


**FAQs:**

* **Is albendazole safe during pregnancy?**  No, albendazole is generally contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential risks to the developing fetus.
* **Is albendazole safe during breastfeeding?**  While some limited amounts may pass into breast milk, the risk is generally considered low. However, it's essential to discuss with your doctor before taking albendazole if you are breastfeeding.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The effects of albendazole vary depending on the infection.  You may not see immediate results, and multiple doses are often required.  Parasite eggs and/or larvae may still be present in stool samples after treatment, but this doesn't always mean treatment failed. Follow-up tests are often needed.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking albendazole?**  It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking albendazole, as it can increase the risk of liver damage.
* **Can I take other medications with albendazole?**  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as albendazole may interact with some of them.
* **What are the signs of a serious allergic reaction?**  Signs of a serious allergic reaction include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, and hives.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
