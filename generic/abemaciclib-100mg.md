# Abemaciclib 100mg

**Generic Name:** Abemaciclib

**Usage:** Abemaciclib is used in combination with other medications to treat certain types of breast cancer. Specifically, it's indicated for:

* **Hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer:**  This is typically used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (like letrozole or anastrozole) in postmenopausal women.
* **HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer:**  This may also be used in combination with fulvestrant in patients who have progressed on endocrine therapy.


**Side Effects:**  Abemaciclib can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  It's crucial to report any concerning symptoms to your doctor immediately.  Common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea:** This is often a significant side effect and may require medication to manage.
* **Nausea:**  Can be managed with anti-nausea medications.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired.
* **Neutropenia:** Low white blood cell count, increasing the risk of infection.  Regular blood tests are essential to monitor this.
* **Alopecia (hair loss):**  Can occur in some patients.
* **Constipation:**  May require interventions.
* **Vomiting:**  Can be managed with medication.
* **Decreased appetite:** Leading to weight loss.


**Serious side Effects:** Although less common, serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* **Severe neutropenia (leading to infections):**  This requires close monitoring and may lead to dose reduction or treatment interruption.
* **Severe diarrhea:**  Can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
* **Liver problems (hepatotoxicity):**  Liver function tests are regularly monitored.
* **Severe lung problems (interstitial lung disease):**  Symptoms such as shortness of breath should be reported immediately.
* **Heart problems (QT prolongation):**  Can lead to dangerous heart rhythms.  ECG monitoring might be necessary.


**How it Works:** Abemaciclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 inhibitor.  These CDKs are enzymes involved in the cell cycle regulation. By inhibiting CDK4 and 6, abemaciclib prevents cancer cells from dividing and growing, slowing tumor progression.  It's particularly effective when combined with hormone therapy in certain types of breast cancer.
