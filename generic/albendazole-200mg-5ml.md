# Albendazole 200mg/5ml

**Generic Name:** Albendazole

**Usage:** Albendazole 200mg/5ml oral suspension is used to treat various parasitic worm infections (helminthiasis), including:

* **Intestinal nematodes:**  Roundworms (ascariasis), hookworms (ankylostomiasis), whipworms (trichuriasis), pinworms (enterobiasis), and threadworms (strongyloidiasis).
* **Cestodes (tapeworms):**  Taenia species (tapeworm), Hymenolepis nana (dwarf tapeworm), and Echinococcus species (hydatid disease - usually requires higher doses and longer treatment courses than for intestinal worms).
* **Certain tissue nematodes:**  Toxocariasis (ocular or visceral larva migrans), although often higher doses are required.


**Note:**  The specific usage and dosage will vary depending on the type of infection, the patient's age and weight, and the severity of the infection.  Always follow the prescription instructions provided by a doctor or other qualified healthcare professional.  This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can occur, although they are not experienced by everyone. Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fever
* Rash
* Hair loss (alopecia) - less common
* Elevated liver enzymes (detected through blood tests) â€“ usually temporary

More serious, but rare, side effects include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Bone marrow suppression (reduction in blood cell production)
* Neurological problems (such as seizures)


**How it Works:** Albendazole is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic (anti-worm medication).  It disrupts the worm's ability to absorb glucose, interfering with its metabolism and ultimately leading to its death. It also affects microtubule formation in the worm, impacting their function and reproduction.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I give Albendazole to children?** A: Yes, but only under the guidance of a doctor. Dosage will be adjusted based on the child's weight and the specific infection.
* **Q: How long do I need to take Albendazole?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the infection. Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment course.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Are there any precautions I should take while taking Albendazole?** A:  Inform your doctor about any pre-existing medical conditions, particularly liver problems.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss use with their doctor.  Regular monitoring of liver function may be necessary during treatment, especially with high-dose or prolonged therapy.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Albendazole?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol during treatment as it can increase the risk of liver problems.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have any concerns about medication interactions.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects usually resolve on their own.  If you experience any serious side effects, such as severe allergic reactions or significant liver problems, seek immediate medical attention.
