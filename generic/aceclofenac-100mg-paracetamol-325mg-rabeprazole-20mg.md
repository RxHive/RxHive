# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Rabeprazole 20mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Rabeprazole 20mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other musculoskeletal disorders.  It's often prescribed for moderate to severe pain.  The specific conditions for which it's used should always be determined by a doctor.  Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), paracetamol is an analgesic and antipyretic (fever reducer), and rabeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).  The rabeprazole is included to help protect the stomach lining from the potential ulcer-causing effects of aceclofenac.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person, but common ones may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, indigestion, ulcers (though rabeprazole helps mitigate this risk).  In rare cases, serious gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation can occur.
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Cardiovascular:**  Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and high blood pressure (especially with long-term use).
* **Hepatic:**  Liver damage (rare but serious).
* **Renal:**  Kidney problems (rare but serious).
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis â€“ a medical emergency).


This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult the medication leaflet or your doctor for a complete list.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals involved in the inflammatory process.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces pain and fever through a mechanism that is not fully understood but is thought to involve inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system.
* **Rabeprazole:**  Reduces stomach acid production by blocking the proton pump in the stomach's parietal cells. This helps prevent the development of gastric ulcers, a common side effect of NSAIDs like aceclofenac.
