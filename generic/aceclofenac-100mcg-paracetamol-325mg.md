# Aceclofenac 100mcg  + Paracetamol 325mg

It's important to note that Aceclofenac is typically available in dosages of 100mg, not 100mcg (micrograms).  100mcg is a thousandth of a milligram, an incredibly low dose for Aceclofenac.  This combination likely doesn't exist at that dosage.  The information below assumes the Aceclofenac dose is 100mg.  Always consult a pharmacist or doctor for accurate information on your specific medication.

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and an analgesic (pain reliever). It's used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

* Mild to moderate pain (e.g., headaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps)
* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic pain (as directed by a doctor)

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and some may be more severe than others. Common side effects include:

* Gastrointestinal issues:  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, indigestion, ulceration
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Skin rash
* Swelling
* Liver problems (rare but serious)
* Kidney problems (rare but serious)
* Increased risk of bleeding
* Allergic reactions (rare but potentially serious, including anaphylaxis)


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This NSAID works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This analgesic reduces fever and provides pain relief, although the exact mechanism isn't fully understood.  It's thought to act on the central nervous system to reduce pain signals.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects of each drug. This allows for more effective pain and inflammation relief at potentially lower doses of each component, minimizing the risk of side effects.
