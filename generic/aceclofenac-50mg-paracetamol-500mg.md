# Aceclofenac 50mg + Paracetamol 500mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 50mg + Paracetamol 500mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and reduce fever.  It's commonly prescribed for mild to moderate pain associated with:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Post-operative pain
* Dental pain
* Menstrual cramps
* Headaches (depending on the cause)
* Muscle aches


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Aceclofenac + Paracetamol can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Indigestion
* Abdominal pain
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Rash
* Swelling

More serious, but less common, side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (such as skin rash, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing)
* Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine, pale stools)
* Kidney problems (decreased urination, swelling in the legs and ankles)
* Stomach ulcers or bleeding (severe stomach pain, black or bloody stools)
* Increased risk of heart attack or stroke (particularly with long-term use or high doses)


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing the production of substances in the body that cause pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).  Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's believed to affect substances in the brain that regulate body temperature and pain perception.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects.  Aceclofenac tackles inflammation, while Paracetamol addresses pain and fever.
