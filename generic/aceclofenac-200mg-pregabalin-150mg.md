# Aceclofenac 200mg + Pregabalin 150mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 200mg + Pregabalin 150mg  (This is a combination drug;  there isn't a single generic name for the combination, it's listed by its components)

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically prescribed for the management of neuropathic pain (nerve pain) accompanied by inflammation.  It's often used for conditions where both pain relief and anti-inflammatory effects are needed. Examples include:

* Post-surgical pain:  especially where nerve damage might be involved.
* Osteoarthritis pain: where inflammation and nerve pain contribute to discomfort.
* Post-herpetic neuralgia (pain after shingles):  a type of neuropathic pain.
* Other types of neuropathic pain: like diabetic neuropathy.

**Important Note:** This medication should only be used as prescribed by a doctor.  The specific usage and dosage will depend on the individual's condition and response to the medication. Self-medication is strongly discouraged.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common:**  Dizziness, headache, nausea, drowsiness, fatigue, constipation, swelling in ankles or feet, dry mouth.
* **Less Common:**  Blurred vision, weight gain, increased appetite, changes in mood, confusion,  sleep problems,  rash, itching.
* **Serious (though rare):**  Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), liver problems, kidney problems, heart problems (particularly in those with pre-existing heart conditions), increased risk of bleeding, suicidal thoughts or behaviors.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing inflammation and pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals involved in the inflammatory process.
* **Pregabalin:** This is an anticonvulsant medication (used to treat seizures), but it is also highly effective in treating neuropathic pain. Its exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it is believed to affect the way the body senses and transmits pain signals.  It works on specific nerve channels (calcium channels) to decrease pain.
