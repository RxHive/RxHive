# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 15mg + Serratiopeptidase 500mg

It's crucial to understand that a combination of Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 15mg + Serratiopeptidase 500mg is **not a standard or commonly prescribed combination**.  The paracetamol dosage (15mg) is extremely low and likely a typographical error.  Paracetamol is typically prescribed in much higher doses (e.g., 325mg-1000mg).  Therefore, the information below is based on the individual components and their typical usage, *not* this specific, unusual combination.  **You should never use medication based on information found online. Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for proper diagnosis and treatment.**

**Generic Name:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer)
* **Serratiopeptidase:** A proteolytic enzyme (breaks down proteins)


**Usage:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other musculoskeletal disorders.
* **Paracetamol:** Used to relieve mild to moderate pain and reduce fever.
* **Serratiopeptidase:** Often used to reduce swelling and inflammation, particularly after surgery or injury.  Its effectiveness is still under research.


**Side Effects:**

* **Aceclofenac:** Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, and allergic reactions (skin rash, itching).  Serious but rare side effects include gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, heart problems, and liver damage.
* **Paracetamol:**  Usually well-tolerated, but high doses or overdose can cause serious liver damage.  Allergic reactions are rare.
* **Serratiopeptidase:**  Generally considered safe, but some people may experience nausea, diarrhea, or allergic reactions.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are involved in the inflammatory process.
* **Paracetamol:** The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.
* **Serratiopeptidase:**  Breaks down proteins involved in inflammation and swelling, potentially helping to reduce pain and promote healing.
