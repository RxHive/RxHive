# Acebrophylline 100mg

**Generic Name:** Acebrophylline

**Usage:** Acebrophylline is a bronchodilator used to treat reversible airway obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and asthma.  It relaxes the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe. It's often used for long-term management of these conditions, not for acute attacks.

**Side Effects:** Like all medications, acebrophylline can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** This is a relatively frequent side effect.
* **Nausea:**  Some individuals may experience nausea, sometimes accompanied by vomiting.
* **Upset stomach:**  Gastrointestinal discomfort is possible.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping may occur, particularly at higher doses.
* **Tremors:** Shaking or trembling may be experienced in some cases.
* **Heart palpitations:**  A feeling of rapid or irregular heartbeat is possible, though less common.
* **Dizziness:** Lightheadedness or dizziness may occur.


**Serious, though less common, side effects require immediate medical attention and include:**

* **Seizures:**  This is a rare but serious side effect.
* **Arrhythmias:** Irregular heartbeats can be life-threatening.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:** Allergic reactions ranging from rash to severe anaphylaxis.


**How it Works:** Acebrophylline is a methylxanthine derivative.  It works primarily by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).  Increased cAMP levels lead to relaxation of the smooth muscles in the airways, resulting in bronchodilation. This improved airflow allows for easier breathing.  It also has some mild anti-inflammatory properties, though less significant than other medications used for COPD and asthma.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take acebrophylline with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.  Some medications may increase the risk of side effects when combined with acebrophylline.
* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking acebrophylline?** A:  Alcohol can exacerbate some side effects of acebrophylline, particularly those affecting the central nervous system like dizziness and insomnia.  It's best to limit or avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking acebrophylline suddenly?** A:  No, you should not stop taking acebrophylline suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can lead to worsening symptoms.  Your doctor will help you gradually reduce the dosage if needed.
* **Q:  Is acebrophylline safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** A:  The safety of acebrophylline during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your doctor to discuss the risks and benefits before taking this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
