# Afatinib dimaleate 40mg

**Generic Name:** Afatinib dimaleate

**Usage:** Afatinib dimaleate is a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used to treat certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Specifically, it's indicated for:

* **Metastatic NSCLC:**  Patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations.  This means the cancer cells have specific genetic alterations making them susceptible to afatinib's effects.
* **Metastatic NSCLC in certain cases:** In some cases, it may also be used in patients with metastatic NSCLC who have progressed on or after EGFR-TKI therapy (other EGFR-targeted therapies).  This is often a second-line or later treatment option.

**It is crucial to note:** Afatinib is a prescription medication and should only be used under the supervision of a healthcare professional.  The specific usage and dosage will depend on individual patient factors and the cancer's characteristics.


**Side Effects:** Afatinib, like other TKIs, can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These can include:

* **Common:** Diarrhea (often severe), rash, dry skin, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, decreased appetite, and changes in nails (e.g., thickening).
* **Serious:** Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs), severe diarrhea leading to dehydration, skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), liver problems (hepatotoxicity), and eye problems (such as corneal changes).

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects vary greatly between individuals.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:** Afatinib is an irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  This means it binds to and blocks the EGFR protein, preventing its signaling pathways.  EGFR is a protein that plays a crucial role in the growth and division of certain cancer cells. By inhibiting EGFR, afatinib slows or stops the growth of cancer cells that rely on this pathway for survival.  The specific genetic mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution) in the EGFR gene make these cancers particularly sensitive to afatinib's action.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is afatinib taken?** A: Afatinib is typically taken orally once daily, with or without food. The exact dosage will be determined by a doctor.
* **Q: What are the precautions I should take while on afatinib?** A: Regular monitoring of liver function, skin, and lungs is necessary.  Patients should report any signs of diarrhea, rash, or shortness of breath immediately.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding are contraindicated.
* **Q: What are the drug interactions?** A: Afatinib can interact with other medications. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins, that you are taking.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: How long will I need to take afatinib?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the response to the medication and your overall health.  This is determined by your oncologist.
