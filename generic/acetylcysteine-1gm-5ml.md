# Acetylcysteine 1gm/5ml

**Generic Name:** Acetylcysteine

**Usage:**

Acetylcysteine 1g/5ml solution is primarily used for:

* **Treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose:** This is its most crucial application.  It works by replenishing glutathione, a vital antioxidant depleted by paracetamol toxicity, thus preventing liver damage.  It is time-sensitive and must be administered as soon as possible after ingestion of a potentially toxic dose of paracetamol.
* **Mucolytic agent:**  It thins and loosens mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up. This is used to treat respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and bronchitis.  It's often used to assist in the removal of thick mucus, particularly before or after procedures like bronchoscopy.

**Note:**  The specific usage will be determined by a doctor based on the individual's condition and needs.  It is crucial to follow prescribed dosage and instructions carefully.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhoea
* Stomach upset
* Mouth sores (stomatitis)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Bronchospasm (in individuals with asthma or reactive airways)

Rare but more serious side effects may occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Liver damage (though rare with appropriate dosage and monitoring)

**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol overdose:** Acetylcysteine acts as a precursor to glutathione, a crucial antioxidant.  Paracetamol overdose depletes glutathione, leading to liver damage.  Acetylcysteine replenishes this vital antioxidant, helping to protect the liver from further harm.
* **Mucolytic agent:** Acetylcysteine breaks down disulfide bonds in mucus, reducing its viscosity (thickness) and making it easier to expel.  This helps to clear airways and improve respiratory function.

**FAQs:**

* **Is it safe to take Acetylcysteine without a doctor's prescription?** No.  Especially in the context of paracetamol overdose, it requires immediate medical attention and dosage must be carefully calculated.  For respiratory uses, a doctor should assess the condition and prescribe accordingly.
* **Can I take Acetylcysteine with other medications?** It's essential to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, to avoid potential drug interactions.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **How should I store Acetylcysteine?** Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.
* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?** Signs include rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness. Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
