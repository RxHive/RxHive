# Acetylcysteine 200mg/ml

**Generic Name:** Acetylcysteine

**Usage:**  Acetylcysteine 200mg/ml is primarily used for:

* **Treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose:** This is its most common and crucial use.  It works to prevent liver damage caused by an overdose.  It must be administered promptly after ingestion of the overdose.
* **Mucolytic agent (thinning mucus):** It's used to loosen thick mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up. This is helpful in conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and bronchitis.  It is usually administered by inhalation or nebulization in this context.
* **Rarely, other uses:**  It might be used in other specific circumstances under medical supervision, such as certain types of poisoning.

**Note:**  The 200mg/ml concentration is typically used for intravenous (IV) administration in paracetamol overdose situations.  Different concentrations and formulations exist for other uses (e.g., oral solutions, inhalation solutions).  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions.


**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary depending on the route of administration and individual sensitivity.  They can include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, headache, and dizziness.
* **Less Common:**  Bronchospasm (inhaled use), mouth sores,  throat irritation (inhaled or oral use).
* **Rare but Serious:**  Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), liver damage (though less likely when used as directed for its intended purpose).


**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol Overdose:** Acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione, a vital antioxidant in the liver.  Paracetamol metabolism produces a toxic metabolite that damages the liver; glutathione helps detoxify this metabolite, preventing liver injury.
* **Mucolytic Agent:**  Acetylcysteine breaks down disulfide bonds in mucus, reducing its viscosity and making it easier to expectorate.
