**Important Note:** This information is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before using this or any medication.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity.  Common side effects may include:

* Gastrointestinal issues:  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, indigestion.  (Aceclofenac is known to cause more GI problems than Paracetamol).

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing the production of substances that cause pain and inflammation in the body.

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).  Its precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's thought to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.

* **Serratiopeptidase:** This is a proteolytic enzyme that helps break down proteins involved in inflammation and swelling. It may help reduce pain and improve tissue healing. The evidence supporting its effectiveness in combination with NSAIDs and Paracetamol is limited and requires further research.
