# Abemaciclib 150mg

**Generic Name:** Abemaciclib

**Usage:** Abemaciclib is an oral medication used in the treatment of certain types of breast cancer.  Specifically, it's approved for use in:

* **First-line treatment of certain HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer:**  This means it's used alongside an aromatase inhibitor (like letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane) in women who have not received prior endocrine therapy for advanced disease.
* **Treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after endocrine therapy:** This is for patients whose cancer has stopped responding to hormonal treatments.

**Important Note:** Abemaciclib is always used in combination with other treatments, never as a monotherapy. The specific usage and dosage will be determined by a healthcare professional based on the individual patient's condition and medical history.


**Side Effects:**  Abemaciclib can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  The most common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea:** This is often a significant side effect and can be severe.
* **Nausea:** Feelings of sickness and potential vomiting.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Neutropenia:** A decrease in white blood cells, increasing the risk of infection.  This is a serious side effect requiring monitoring.
* **Increased risk of infection:**  Due to neutropenia.
* **Alopecia (Hair loss):**  Temporary hair thinning or loss.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  These can be managed with antiemetic medications.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty passing stools.
* **Pneumonitis:** Inflammation of the lungs (rare but serious).
* **QT prolongation:** An abnormal heart rhythm (serious, requires monitoring).
* **Liver problems:** Elevated liver enzymes.


This is not an exhaustive list.  Always report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor.


**How it Works:** Abemaciclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 inhibitor.  These CDKs are enzymes involved in the cell cycle regulation.  By inhibiting CDK 4 and 6, abemaciclib blocks the progression of the cell cycle, preventing the growth and division of cancer cells. Specifically, it targets breast cancer cells that are hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and HER2-negative.  It works best in combination with endocrine therapy.
