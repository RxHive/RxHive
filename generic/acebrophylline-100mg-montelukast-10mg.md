# Acebrophylline 100mg  + Montelukast 10mg

**Generic Name:** Acebrophylline 100mg + Montelukast 10mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to prevent and treat symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Acebrophylline, a theophylline derivative, is a bronchodilator that relaxes the muscles in the airways, making breathing easier. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that blocks the action of leukotrienes, substances in the body that can cause airway inflammation and narrowing.  Together, they offer a dual approach to managing respiratory symptoms.  The specific usage will be determined by a physician based on the patient's condition and severity. It's crucial to follow prescribed dosage and not self-medicate.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary among individuals, but some common ones include:

* **Acebrophylline-related:** Headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, insomnia, nervousness, irritability, restlessness, heart palpitations, increased urination.  In severe cases, seizures can occur.
* **Montelukast-related:** Headache, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, fever, rash, increased liver enzymes.  Rarely, serious side effects such as depression, suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, and allergic reactions can occur.

This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects and their severity.


**How it Works:**

* **Acebrophylline:**  Relaxes the smooth muscles surrounding the airways, making it easier to breathe. It achieves this by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), a molecule that promotes muscle relaxation.
* **Montelukast:** Blocks leukotriene receptors. Leukotrienes are inflammatory substances that contribute to airway narrowing, mucus production, and inflammation. By blocking these receptors, montelukast reduces inflammation and bronchoconstriction, improving lung function and reducing symptoms.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take this medication with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements, as interactions are possible.  Certain medications can affect the metabolism or effectiveness of acebrophylline or montelukast.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
