**Usage:** Albendazole is an antiparasitic medication used to treat a variety of infections caused by worms (helminths).  Specific uses include:

* **Neurocysticercosis (NCC):**  Infection of the brain and other tissues caused by larval cysts of the pork tapeworm *Taenia solium*.
* **Hydatid disease (echinococcosis):** Infection caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm *Echinococcus*.
* **Ascariasis:** Infection with roundworms (*Ascaris lumbricoides*).
* **Hookworm infection:** Infection with hookworms (*Necator americanus* and *Ancylostoma duodenale*).
* **Strongyloidiasis:** Infection with threadworms (*Strongyloides stercoralis*).
* **Trichuriasis (whipworm infection):** Infection with whipworms (*Trichuris trichiura*).
* **Enterobiasis (pinworm infection):** Infection with pinworms (*Enterobius vermicularis*).
* **Toxocariasis:** Infection with the larvae of roundworms (*Toxocara canis* and *Toxocara cati*).

The specific dosage and duration of treatment will vary depending on the type of infection and the patient's age and health.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can occur, although they are not experienced by everyone.  Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fever
* Elevated liver enzymes (detected through blood tests)
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Rash

More serious, but less common, side effects include:

* Bone marrow suppression (reduced blood cell production)
* Liver damage
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)

If you experience any serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.

**How it Works:** Albendazole interferes with the function of microtubules, which are essential components of the worm's cells.  By disrupting microtubule formation and function, albenazole inhibits the worm's ability to absorb nutrients and ultimately kills the parasite.

**FAQs:**

* **Is Albendazole safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?**  No, Albendazole is generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to potential risks to the developing fetus or infant.  Discuss this with your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Can I take Albendazole with other medications?**  Albendazole can interact with certain medications.  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist about all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking.  Certain medications can increase the risk of liver damage when taken with Albendazole.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The effectiveness of Albendazole can vary depending on the type of infection and the individual.  Symptoms may improve within a few days or weeks, but complete eradication of the parasite may take longer.  Follow-up testing may be needed to confirm the success of treatment.
* **What if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to catch up.
* **Can I buy Albendazole over-the-counter?**  Albendazole is usually available only with a prescription from a doctor.  Self-treating parasitic infections can be dangerous and may lead to complications.  A proper diagnosis is crucial.
