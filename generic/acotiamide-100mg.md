# Acotiamide 100mg

**Generic Name:** Acotiamide

**Usage:** Acotiamide is used to treat functional dyspepsia (FD), a condition characterized by upper abdominal discomfort or pain not caused by structural problems like ulcers or cancers. It's specifically indicated for FD patients with symptoms such as postprandial fullness, early satiation, and epigastric pain.  It is typically prescribed when lifestyle changes and other treatments have been ineffective.  **It is important to note that acotiamide is not available in many countries and its availability and regulatory approval vary widely.**  Always consult a doctor before using this medication.

**Side Effects:**  Side Effects can vary from person to person, but common ones reported include:

* **Common (affecting 1-10% of users):**  Drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, dry mouth, nausea.
* **Less Common (affecting less than 1% of users):**  Headache, palpitations, rash, elevated liver enzymes.
* **Rare:** Serious side effects are rare but can include allergic reactions (anaphylaxis),  extrapyramidal symptoms (movement disorders), and QT interval prolongation (a heart rhythm problem).

This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult the medication's package insert or your doctor for a complete list of potential side effects.

**How it Works:** Acotiamide is a gastroprokinetic agent.  It works by increasing the motility of the stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract. This means it helps to speed up the movement of food through the digestive system, which can alleviate symptoms associated with functional dyspepsia like fullness, bloating, and pain.  Its exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to involve interaction with dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT4 receptors.
