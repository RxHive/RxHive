# Acetylcysteine 300 mg + Ambroxol 60 mg

**Generic Name:**  Acetylcysteine 300mg + Ambroxol 60mg (This combination doesn't have a single, widely-used generic name. The names will vary by manufacturer.)


**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat productive coughs (coughs with mucus) associated with respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitis and pneumonia.  Acetylcysteine helps to thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up. Ambroxol helps to further thin the mucus and improve its clearance from the airways.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the specific formulation. Common side effects may include:

* **Acetylcysteine:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, mouth sores, bad breath (garlic-like odor), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).  Rarely, more serious reactions like bronchospasm (narrowing of the airways) can occur.
* **Ambroxol:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, dry mouth.  Rarely, more serious allergic reactions can occur.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Always consult the patient information leaflet provided with your specific medication for a complete list of potential side effects.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience a serious allergic reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue).


**How it Works:**

* **Acetylcysteine (NAC):**  It's a mucolytic agent, meaning it breaks down the disulfide bonds in mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expectorate. This helps clear the airways and relieves congestion.
* **Ambroxol:** It's an expectorant, stimulating the production of surfactant in the lungs. Surfactant helps to keep the airways moist and clear, further assisting in mucus clearance.  It also has some mild effects on cough suppression.

The combined action of acetylcysteine and ambroxol provides a synergistic effect, leading to more effective mucus clearance than either drug alone.
