# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 15mg

It's important to note that a combination of Aceclofenac 100mg and Paracetamol 15mg is **highly unusual**.  Paracetamol (acetaminophen) dosages are typically much higher (325mg - 1000mg) when used in combination with NSAIDs like Aceclofenac.  A 15mg dose of Paracetamol is ineffective and likely a mistake in the provided information.  This response will address Aceclofenac 100mg + a standard Paracetamol dose (e.g., 325mg or 500mg), but you should **consult a doctor or pharmacist** if you have a medication with this unusual dosage.

**Assuming the Paracetamol dosage is a typo and should be significantly higher (e.g., 325mg-500mg):**


**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac + Paracetamol (Acetaminophen)

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve moderate to severe pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic pain
* Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea)
* Other inflammatory conditions (as determined by a physician)

**Side Effects:** The side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage, but common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, ulcers (especially with long-term use), bleeding.  Aceclofenac carries a higher risk of GI side effects than Paracetamol.
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and high blood pressure (especially with long-term use).
* **Liver:** While rare with Paracetamol at standard doses, liver damage is a possibility with overdose. Aceclofenac can also affect liver function in some individuals.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis â€“ seek immediate medical attention).
* **Kidney:**  Aceclofenac can impact kidney function, especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney disease.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs. Its exact mechanism of action is still not fully understood, but it's believed to primarily affect the central nervous system.  The combination provides broader pain relief and potentially reduces the required dose of each individual drug.

**FAQs:**

* **How long should I take this medication?**  Only as directed by a doctor. Do not exceed the prescribed dose or duration.
* **Can I take this medication with other drugs?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.  This is especially important with blood thinners, other NSAIDs, and certain medications for heart conditions or liver problems.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **What are the signs of an overdose?** Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect an overdose. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, drowsiness, confusion, and liver damage (dark urine, jaundice).
* **Is this medication suitable for everyone?**  No.  It should be avoided by individuals with known allergies to either Aceclofenac or Paracetamol, severe liver or kidney disease, active peptic ulcers, or bleeding disorders. Pregnancy and breastfeeding require special considerations; consult your doctor.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Alcohol can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and liver damage. It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this combination.
