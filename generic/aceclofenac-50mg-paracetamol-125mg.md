# Aceclofenac 50mg + Paracetamol 125mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 50mg + Paracetamol 125mg (Combination Drug)

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation (swelling) associated with various conditions, such as:

* **Mild to moderate pain:**  Headaches, muscle aches, back pain, toothaches, menstrual cramps.
* **Inflammatory conditions:**  Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (though often used in conjunction with stronger medications for these conditions).
* **Post-surgical or post-traumatic pain:** Pain following minor surgery or injury.

**It is important to note:** This is not a strong pain reliever and is not suitable for severe pain.  For severe pain, stronger analgesics should be used under medical supervision.  Always consult a doctor before using this medication, especially if you have underlying health conditions.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Aceclofenac + Paracetamol can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea.
* **Central Nervous System:**  Headache, dizziness, drowsiness.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling.  Rarely, more serious allergic reactions can occur.
* **Other possible side effects:**  Increased liver enzymes (detected through blood tests), fluid retention.

This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and consult a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Belongs to a class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  A pain reliever and fever reducer. Its exact mechanism is not fully understood but is thought to act on the central nervous system to reduce pain signals and lower fever.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning their combined action is greater than the sum of their individual effects.  Aceclofenac tackles inflammation, while Paracetamol addresses pain and fever.
