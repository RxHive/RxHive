# Aceclofenac 200mg + Rabeprazole 200mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 200mg + Rabeprazole 200mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  The aceclofenac component is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation.  The rabeprazole component is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces stomach acid production.  The rabeprazole is included to protect the stomach lining from the potential ulcer-causing effects of aceclofenac.  It's crucial to only take this medication as prescribed by a doctor and not for self-medication.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, flatulence.  (These are reduced by the inclusion of rabeprazole, but still possible).
* **Central Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness.
* **Other:**  Skin rash, itching, edema (swelling), increased liver enzymes (detected via blood tests).  Rare but serious side effects include: severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), stomach ulcers or bleeding, kidney problems, liver damage, cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke).


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This NSAID works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.  By reducing prostaglandin production, aceclofenac helps to alleviate pain and inflammation in joints and other affected areas.
* **Rabeprazole:** This PPI works by reducing the amount of acid produced by the stomach's parietal cells.  This protective effect is crucial because NSAIDs like aceclofenac can irritate the stomach lining and increase the risk of ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding.
