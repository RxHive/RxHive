# Acyclovir 3% w/v

**Generic Name:** Acyclovir

**Usage:** Acyclovir 3% w/v is a topical antiviral medication used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and type 2 infections.  This typically includes:

* **Cold sores (oral herpes):**  Reduces the duration and severity of symptoms.
* **Genital herpes:**  May help reduce the duration and severity of outbreaks, but it doesn't cure the infection.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's instructions carefully as dosage and application may differ from oral herpes treatment.

**Note:** A 3% w/v concentration is relatively high and may be prescribed by a doctor for severe cases or specific situations.  Over-the-counter acyclovir products typically have lower concentrations.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions for usage.  Self-treating genital herpes is strongly discouraged.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and localized to the application area. They can include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Itching
* Redness
* Skin dryness

Rarely, more serious side effects can occur.  If you experience any severe reactions, stop using the medication and seek medical attention immediately.


**How it Works:** Acyclovir is a nucleoside analog.  It works by interfering with the replication of the herpes virus DNA.  Specifically, it's incorporated into the viral DNA, halting its further reproduction and thereby reducing the viral load and symptoms.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How often should I apply acyclovir 3% w/v?**  A: The frequency of application depends on the specific instructions given by your doctor or as directed on the product label. It's typically multiple times a day.
