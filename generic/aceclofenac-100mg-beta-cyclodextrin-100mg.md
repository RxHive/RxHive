# Aceclofenac 100mg  + Beta-Cyclodextrin 100mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Beta-Cyclodextrin 100mg

**Usage:** This combination is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Post-operative pain
* Other forms of musculoskeletal pain


**Note:**  The beta-cyclodextrin is included to improve the solubility and bioavailability of aceclofenac.  It is not itself a therapeutic agent.  The usage is primarily determined by the aceclofenac component.  Always consult a doctor before using this medication and follow their prescribed dosage and duration.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  The most common side effects are related to the gastrointestinal tract. These can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, heartburn, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, and in rare cases, gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration.
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, and insomnia are possible.
* **Cardiovascular:**  Increased risk of heart attack or stroke, particularly with long-term use or high doses (though evidence is debated). Swelling in the ankles and legs (edema) can also occur.
* **Hepatic:** Liver function abnormalities have been reported.
* **Renal:**  Kidney problems have been reported in rare cases.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Skin rashes, itching, hives, and in rare cases, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).

This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects may occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe side effects.


**How it Works:**

Aceclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.  Beta-cyclodextrin enhances the absorption of aceclofenac, allowing for better and faster pain relief.
