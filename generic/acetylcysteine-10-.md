# Acetylcysteine 10%

**Generic Name:** Acetylcysteine

**Usage:**

Acetylcysteine 10% solution is primarily used for:

* **Treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose:** This is its most common and crucial use.  It works by replenishing glutathione, a vital antioxidant depleted during paracetamol overdose, thus preventing liver damage.  This must be administered intravenously (IV) under medical supervision.

* **Mucous thinning:** Inhaled or nebulized acetylcysteine can help loosen and thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.  This is used for conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and bronchitis.  Oral formulations are also available for this purpose, although less commonly as a 10% solution.

* **Other uses (less common):** It's sometimes used to treat certain types of drug poisoning and to dissolve thick mucus in other situations.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary depending on the route of administration (IV, inhalation, oral).  Common side effects may include:

* **Inhalation:** Cough, bronchospasm (constriction of the airways), throat irritation, nausea, vomiting.
* **Intravenous:**  Nausea, vomiting, flushing, headache, fever, allergic reactions (rare but potentially severe).  Rare but serious side effects can include anaphylaxis.
* **Oral:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomachache, mouth sores.


**How it Works:**

Acetylcysteine's mechanism of action differs depending on its use:

* **Paracetamol overdose:** It acts as a precursor to glutathione, a crucial antioxidant that helps neutralize the toxic metabolite of paracetamol (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine or NAPQI) that causes liver damage.  By increasing glutathione levels, it protects the liver.

* **Mucus thinning:** It breaks down disulfide bonds in mucus glycoproteins, making the mucus less viscous and easier to expel.


**FAQs:**

* **Is acetylcysteine addictive?** No, acetylcysteine is not an addictive substance.

* **Can I take acetylcysteine without a doctor's prescription?**  For paracetamol overdose, absolutely not.  It must be given intravenously under close medical supervision. For other uses, such as inhaled treatments for respiratory conditions, a prescription is usually required.  Never self-medicate with acetylcysteine.

* **What are the contraindications?**  Known allergy to acetylcysteine is a major contraindication.  Caution is needed in patients with asthma or other respiratory conditions, as it can trigger bronchospasm.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using acetylcysteine.

* **What if I miss a dose?** For inhaled or oral formulations, consult your doctor or pharmacist about the appropriate course of action.  Missed doses should not be doubled.  For IV treatment of paracetamol overdose, the dosing regimen is critical and must be followed strictly under medical supervision.

* **How is acetylcysteine stored?**  Store according to the instructions on the packaging, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
