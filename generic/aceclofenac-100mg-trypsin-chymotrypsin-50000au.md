# Aceclofenac 100mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 50000AU

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 50000AU

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue injuries.  Aceclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation. Trypsin and Chymotrypsin are proteolytic enzymes that help reduce swelling and inflammation by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory process.  It's important to note that this specific combination may not be available in all regions and its use should always be under the guidance of a physician.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, indigestion, ulceration, bleeding (rare but serious).
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and high blood pressure (especially with long-term use).
* **Allergic Reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis - a serious, life-threatening reaction).
* **Liver and Kidney:** Liver damage, kidney problems (especially in individuals with pre-existing conditions).
* **Other:**  Increased bleeding time, fluid retention.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This NSAID works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Trypsin and Chymotrypsin:** These enzymes break down proteins associated with inflammation and swelling, thereby reducing edema (swelling) and facilitating tissue repair.  The combination aims for a synergistic effect, where the NSAID controls pain and inflammation while the enzymes aid in resolving the underlying tissue damage.

**FAQs:**
