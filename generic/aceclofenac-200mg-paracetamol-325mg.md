**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 200mg + Paracetamol 325mg

* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Dental pain
* Menstrual cramps
* Post-surgical pain

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).  Its exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work by affecting certain chemicals in the brain that control body temperature and pain signals.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects.  Aceclofenac tackles the inflammation component, while Paracetamol manages the pain and fever.
