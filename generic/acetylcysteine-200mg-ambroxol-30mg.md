## Acetylcysteine 200mg + Ambroxol 30mg

**Generic Name:**  This combination drug doesn't have a single generic name as it combines two active ingredients. The generic names are **Acetylcysteine** and **Ambroxol**.

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat productive coughs (coughs that produce mucus) associated with respiratory tract infections like bronchitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis.  Acetylcysteine helps to thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up. Ambroxol also helps to thin the mucus and may increase the amount of fluid in the airways, further assisting in mucus clearance.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and may include:

* **Acetylcysteine:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling),  mouth sores, unusual smell or taste in the mouth.  Rarely, bronchospasm (wheezing) can occur in individuals with asthma or other respiratory conditions.
* **Ambroxol:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, dry mouth. Rare side effects include skin reactions, and in very rare cases, liver problems.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Always consult the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication or your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of possible side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Acetylcysteine:** Acts as a mucolytic agent. It breaks down the disulfide bonds in mucus glycoproteins, making the mucus less viscous and easier to expel.  It also has some antioxidant properties.
* **Ambroxol:**  Is a secretolytic agent. It stimulates the production of surfactant (a substance that helps keep the airways open) and increases the amount of fluid in the airways, thereby facilitating mucus clearance.
