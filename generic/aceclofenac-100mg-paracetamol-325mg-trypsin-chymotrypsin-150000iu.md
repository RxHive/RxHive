# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 150000IU

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 150000IU

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Soft tissue injuries (sprains, strains)
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic inflammation

It's important to note that this is not a first-line treatment for these conditions and should be used as directed by a physician.  Self-medicating with this combination is strongly discouraged.


**Side Effects:**  The side effects can vary from person to person and may include but are not limited to:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, ulceration (rare but serious).  Aceclofenac, in particular, carries a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation, though usually rare.
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Skin rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema â€“ a medical emergency).
* **Hepatic:**  Elevated liver enzymes (rare but requires monitoring).
* **Renal:**  Fluid retention, changes in kidney function (especially in pre-existing kidney disease).
* **Other:**  Increased bleeding time (due to the NSAID component), tinnitus (ringing in the ears).


This is not an exhaustive list, and more serious side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe or concerning side effects.


**How it Works:** This combination medication works through a synergistic effect of its components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits the production of prostaglandins, which are responsible for pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs, possibly by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes in the central nervous system.  Its anti-inflammatory effects are less pronounced than aceclofenac.
* **Trypsin Chymotrypsin:** Proteolytic enzymes that help break down proteins associated with inflammation and swelling.  They are believed to aid in reducing edema and facilitating tissue repair.


The combination aims to provide broader pain relief and anti-inflammatory effects compared to using each component individually.
