# Aceclofenac 100mg + Pregabalin 75mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Pregabalin 75mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically prescribed for the management of neuropathic pain (nerve pain) accompanied by inflammation.  It's often used for conditions where both pain relief and anti-inflammatory effects are needed. Examples include osteoarthritis with associated nerve pain or post-surgical pain with significant inflammation.  **It's crucial to understand that this is not an over-the-counter medication and should only be used under the strict supervision of a doctor.**  The dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by the physician based on the individual's condition and response to therapy.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, though not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **From Aceclofenac:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, indigestion, heartburn, abdominal pain, constipation, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, fluid retention, increased liver enzymes (detected through blood tests).  Rarely, more serious side effects like allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), stomach ulcers, bleeding, kidney problems, and cardiovascular events can occur.
* **From Pregabalin:** Dizziness, drowsiness, blurred vision, weight gain, swelling in the hands or feet, fatigue, dry mouth, constipation, nausea. Rarely, more serious side effects like allergic reactions, suicidal thoughts or behaviour, and increased risk of infections can occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing inflammation and pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to inflammation and pain signaling.

* **Pregabalin:** This is an anticonvulsant medication that's also used to treat nerve pain. Its precise mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work by affecting the way nerve cells communicate with each other, reducing the transmission of pain signals.


**FAQs:**

* **Is it addictive?**  Pregabalin carries a risk of dependence, especially with long-term use or higher doses.  Aceclofenac is not considered addictive in the same way.  Always follow your doctor's instructions and discuss any concerns about dependence.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Alcohol can exacerbate the side effects of both aceclofenac (increased risk of stomach upset) and pregabalin (increased drowsiness and dizziness).  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.

* **Can I drive while taking this medication?**  Drowsiness is a common side effect of both aceclofenac and pregabalin.  Do not drive or operate heavy machinery until you know how this medication affects you.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **When should I contact my doctor?**  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects, such as severe allergic reactions, stomach pain, black or bloody stools, unusual bruising or bleeding, difficulty breathing, or changes in mental state.
