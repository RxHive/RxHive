# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 150000AU

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 150000AU

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various musculoskeletal conditions such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Post-surgical inflammation and pain
* Soft tissue injuries (sprains, strains)
* Back pain

It's crucial to note that this is a symptomatic treatment; it doesn't cure the underlying condition.  Always consult a doctor to determine the appropriate dosage and duration of treatment.  Self-medication is discouraged.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, though not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, heartburn, constipation, diarrhea)
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Liver enzyme elevation (rare)
* Kidney problems (rare)

**Serious side effects, though rare, include:**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Liver damage
* Kidney failure


**How it Works:** This combination drug works through a synergistic action of its components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, substances that contribute to pain and swelling.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic and antipyretic (pain reliever and fever reducer) that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs, potentially enhancing the pain-relieving effect.  The exact mechanism is not fully understood but is thought to involve inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system.
* **Trypsin Chymotrypsin:** Proteolytic enzymes that help break down proteins involved in inflammation and swelling. This can assist in reducing edema and promoting faster healing of soft tissues.  However, the efficacy of trypsin-chymotrypsin in this context is debated, and more research is needed.
