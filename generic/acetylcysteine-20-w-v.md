# Acetylcysteine 20% w/v

**Generic Name:** Acetylcysteine (N-acetylcysteine)

**Usage:**

Acetylcysteine 20% w/v solution is primarily used for:

* **Treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose:** This is its most crucial application.  It works by replenishing glutathione, a vital antioxidant depleted during paracetamol overdose, thus preventing liver damage.
* **Mucolytic agent:** It can thin and loosen thick mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up. This is used in conditions like cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and pneumonia.  However, its effectiveness as a mucolytic in some of these conditions is debated and its use is not always first-line treatment.

**Important Note:**  The 20% w/v solution is *not* generally used for oral administration in mucolytic applications.  Different formulations (e.g., oral tablets, granules, inhalation solutions) are available for this purpose. The 20% w/v solution is almost exclusively for intravenous administration in paracetamol overdose situations.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary depending on the route of administration and individual sensitivity.  Common side effects, especially with intravenous administration, may include:

* **Nausea and vomiting:**  These are relatively common.
* **Headache:**  Can occur in some patients.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  A serious but less common side effect, especially with rapid intravenous administration.
* **Bronchospasm (constriction of airways):**  More likely in patients with asthma or other respiratory conditions.  Careful monitoring is needed.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but potentially severe, including skin rashes, itching, swelling, and anaphylaxis.
* **Burning sensation (during IV administration):**  This can often be minimized with slow infusion.


**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol overdose:** Acetylcysteine replenishes hepatic glutathione, a crucial antioxidant that is depleted during paracetamol overdose.  Glutathione helps to conjugate the toxic metabolite of paracetamol (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine), preventing it from causing severe liver damage.
* **Mucolytic action:**  Acetylcysteine breaks disulfide bonds in mucus glycoproteins, reducing the viscosity and making the mucus more easily expectorated.


**FAQs:**
