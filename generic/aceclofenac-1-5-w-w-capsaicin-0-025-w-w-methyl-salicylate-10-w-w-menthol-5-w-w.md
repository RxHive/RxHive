# Aceclofenac 1.5% w/w + Capsaicin 0.025% w/w + Methyl Salicylate 10% w/w + Menthol 5% w/w

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 1.5% w/w + Capsaicin 0.025% w/w + Methyl Salicylate 10% w/w + Menthol 5% w/w  (This is not a single generic name, as it's a combination of four active ingredients.)


**Usage:** This topical combination is typically used for the temporary relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as:

* Arthritis (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis)
* Muscle strains
* Sprains
* Bruises
* Back pain


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and the specific formulation.  Possible side effects include:

* **Local skin reactions:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness, rash, swelling at the application site. These are usually mild and temporary.
* **Allergic reactions:** In rare cases, more severe allergic reactions can occur, including hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue (angioedema), and difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.
* **Systemic effects (less common but possible, especially with overuse or large application areas):**  Aceclofenac can cause gastrointestinal upset (nausea, heartburn, indigestion), while other ingredients could contribute to headaches or dizziness.


**How it Works:** This combination product utilizes several mechanisms to provide pain relief:

* **Aceclofenac:**  A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation and pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals involved in the inflammatory process.
* **Capsaicin:**  A natural compound from chili peppers that depletes substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in pain signaling. This results in a temporary desensitization to pain.  Initial application may cause a burning sensation.
* **Methyl Salicylate:**  A salicylate derivative with analgesic (pain-relieving) and anti-inflammatory properties. It works similarly to aspirin but is applied topically.
* **Menthol:**  A natural cooling agent that provides a localized anesthetic effect, reducing pain sensations and creating a soothing feeling.
