# Albumin 20% w/v

**Generic Name:** Albumin (Human) 20% w/v

**Usage:** Albumin 20% w/v is a blood volume expander used to treat hypovolemic shock and other conditions associated with low blood volume.  Specific uses include:

* **Hypovolemic shock:**  Replacing lost blood volume due to trauma, surgery, burns, or other causes.
* **Hypoalbuminemia:**  Treating low albumin levels in the blood, often seen in liver disease, kidney disease, or malnutrition.
* **Burns:**  Managing fluid loss in severe burns.
* **Cardiac surgery:**  Maintaining blood volume during and after cardiac surgery.
* **Nephrotic syndrome:**  Treating edema and hypoalbuminemia associated with nephrotic syndrome.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can range from mild to severe and may include:

* **Mild:**  Fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, flushing, muscle aches.
* **Moderate:**  Hypotension (low blood pressure), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), shortness of breath, chest pain.
* **Severe (rare but potentially life-threatening):**  Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), heart failure, thromboembolism.


**How it Works:** Albumin is a naturally occurring protein in the blood that helps maintain blood volume and pressure.  The 20% w/v solution is a concentrated form of albumin that, when administered intravenously, expands the blood volume by drawing fluid from the interstitial space (the space between cells) into the bloodstream. This increases blood pressure and improves tissue perfusion (blood flow to tissues).  It also contributes to maintaining oncotic pressure, the pressure that keeps fluid within the blood vessels.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is albumin 20% w/v the same as albumin 5%?** A: No, they differ in concentration.  20% is a more concentrated solution used for more severe hypovolemia, while 5% is used for less severe volume depletion or hypoalbuminemia.
* **Q: Can I use albumin 20% w/v at home?** A: No, albumin 20% w/v is administered intravenously by a healthcare professional in a hospital or clinical setting.  It requires careful monitoring during and after administration.
* **Q: Are there any contraindications?** A: Yes, contraindications include severe anemia, severe heart failure, severe pulmonary edema, and known allergy to albumin.
* **Q: What are the potential drug interactions?** A:  Interactions are possible with other medications affecting blood volume or coagulation.  Consult with a physician or pharmacist about potential interactions.
* **Q: How is it stored?** A: Albumin 20% w/v should be stored at room temperature, protected from light, and used before the expiration date.
