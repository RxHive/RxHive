# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 375mg + Chlorzoxazone 250mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 375mg + Chlorzoxazone 250mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically prescribed for the short-term relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as:

* **Osteoarthritis:**  Pain and stiffness in joints due to cartilage breakdown.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis:**  Pain and inflammation in joints due to an autoimmune disorder.
* **Sprains and strains:**  Injuries to muscles and ligaments.
* **Back pain:**  Pain in the lower back, often due to muscle strain or other musculoskeletal issues.


**It is crucial to understand that this medication is for pain relief and does *not* address the underlying cause of the condition.**  Consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition.  This medication should only be used as directed by a physician.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include, but are not limited to:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, indigestion, ulcers (rare but serious).
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (seek immediate medical attention if this occurs).
* **Liver:**  Elevated liver enzymes (rare but serious, requires monitoring).
* **Kidney:**  Reduced kidney function (rare but serious, requires monitoring).
* **Other:**  Fluid retention, changes in blood pressure, increased bleeding risk.


This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects are possible.  If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and consult a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** This combination medication works through a synergistic effect of its three components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic and antipyretic (fever reducer) that reduces pain and fever through a less understood mechanism, possibly by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system.
* **Chlorzoxazone:** A muscle relaxant that relieves muscle spasms and pain by affecting the central nervous system.


The combination of these three drugs provides broader pain relief and addresses both the inflammatory and muscle spasm components often present in musculoskeletal conditions.
