# Albendazole 200mg

**Generic Name:** Albendazole

**Usage:** Albendazole is an antiparasitic medication used to treat various worm infestations (helminthiasis).  Specific uses include:

* **Nematode infections:**  Roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), hookworm (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale), whipworm (Trichuris trichiura), pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis).
* **Cestode infections:** Tapeworm (Taenia spp., Hymenolepis nana, Echinococcus granulosus â€“ although higher doses and longer treatment courses are often needed for Echinococcus).
* **Other parasitic infections:**  Some forms of larval migrans (e.g., visceral larva migrans), and certain other parasitic infections (as determined by a physician).

It's crucial to note that albendazole is only effective against specific types of parasites.  It will *not* work against all types of worms or other infections.  A doctor's diagnosis is necessary to determine the appropriate medication and treatment plan.


**Side Effects:**  Common side effects of albendazole include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fever

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Liver damage (elevated liver enzymes)
* Bone marrow suppression (reduced blood cell counts)
* Hair loss
* Neurological effects (e.g., seizures, ataxia)


**How it Works:** Albendazole interferes with the metabolism of parasitic worms, preventing them from absorbing nutrients and ultimately leading to their death.  It specifically targets the microtubules within the parasitic cells, disrupting essential cellular functions.


**FAQs:**

* **Is albendazole safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?**  Albendazole is generally considered unsafe during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester.  Its use during breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with a doctor, weighing the potential benefits against the risks to the infant.

* **Can I take albendazole with other medications?**  Some medications may interact with albendazole.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **How long does it take to work?**  The effectiveness of albendazole varies depending on the type and severity of the infection.  Symptoms may improve within a few days, but complete elimination of the parasites may take longer.  Follow-up tests may be needed to confirm the treatment's success.

* **Are there any precautions I should take?**  Individuals with liver or bone marrow problems should use albendazole with caution and under close medical supervision.  Inform your doctor about any pre-existing medical conditions.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  If you experience any severe or persistent side effects, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.
