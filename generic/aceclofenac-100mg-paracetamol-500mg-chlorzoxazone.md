**How it Works:** This combination drug works through the combined action of its three components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  A pain reliever and fever reducer.  Its precise mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.
* **Chlorzoxazone:** A muscle relaxant that helps to relieve muscle spasms and stiffness. Its exact mechanism is not fully understood but it is thought to act on the central nervous system.

The combination of these three drugs provides a multi-pronged approach to managing pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders.
