# Albendazole 400mg + Levamisole 150mg

**Generic Name:** Albendazole 400mg + Levamisole 150mg  (This combination is not always available as a single fixed-dose combination product globally. Availability varies by region.)

**Usage:** This combination is primarily used to treat certain types of parasitic worm infections (helminthiases), specifically those caused by:

* **Nematodes:**  Roundworms such as *Ascaris lumbricoides* (roundworm), *Trichuris trichiura* (whipworm), *Necator americanus* and *Ancylostoma duodenale* (hookworms).
* **Cestodes:** Tapeworms, although the efficacy against certain tapeworm species may be limited and other treatments might be preferred.

**It's crucial to note:** The specific indication and effectiveness depend on the parasite species involved and the geographical region.  This medication should only be used under the guidance of a physician who can diagnose the infection and determine if this combination therapy is appropriate.  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Fever**
* **Malaise (general feeling of discomfort)**
* **Transient elevation of liver enzymes (this requires monitoring)**
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives (in rare cases, more severe allergic reactions can occur)

**Serious side effects (though rare) can include:**

* **Bone marrow suppression (low blood cell counts)**
* **Liver damage**
* **Neurological effects:** Seizures, dizziness, vertigo, ataxia (loss of coordination)
* **Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)**

**How it Works:**

Albendazole and levamisole are anthelmintic drugs, meaning they kill or impair parasitic worms. They work through different mechanisms:

* **Albendazole:** Interferes with the worm's ability to absorb glucose, leading to paralysis and death of the parasite. It also affects the microtubules within the worm's cells.
* **Levamisole:**  Acts as an immunostimulant, boosting the body's immune response to help eliminate the parasites. It also has some direct anthelmintic activity by causing paralysis of the worms.  The combination of both drugs often provides broader-spectrum efficacy against different parasitic worms.

**FAQs:**

* **Is this medication safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**  Generally, no.  This combination is usually contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential harm to the developing fetus or infant.  Alternative treatments should be considered.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication as it can potentially increase the risk of side effects, particularly liver-related ones.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Consult your doctor or pharmacist. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **How long does it take to work?**  The effectiveness may vary depending on the parasite type and infection severity.  Your doctor will likely monitor you for effectiveness and potentially prescribe further treatment if needed.

* **Are there any drug interactions?** Yes, this medication can interact with certain other drugs.  Inform your doctor about all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal supplements) you are taking.
