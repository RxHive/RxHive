# Allopurinol 250mg

**Generic Name:** Allopurinol

**Usage:**

Allopurinol is used to lower levels of uric acid in the blood.  High levels of uric acid can lead to gout attacks (sudden, severe joint pain), kidney stones, and other health problems.  It's primarily used to:

* **Prevent gout attacks:** By reducing uric acid production, it helps prevent future attacks.
* **Treat hyperuricemia:** This is a condition where there's too much uric acid in the blood.
* **Dissolve kidney stones:** In some cases, it can help dissolve uric acid kidney stones.
* **Reduce the risk of gout-related kidney disease:** By lowering uric acid levels, it can protect the kidneys from damage.


**Side Effects:**

Allopurinol, like any medication, can cause side effects.  These can range from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Rash:** This is a relatively common side effect and can range from mild to severe.  **A serious allergic reaction, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), is a possibility, though rare.  Seek immediate medical attention if you develop a rash.**
* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are less common but can occur.
* **Diarrhea:**  Also a less common side effect.
* **Headache:** A relatively mild side effect.
* **Dizziness:** Less common.
* **Muscle aches:** Less common.
* **Liver problems:** Rare, but serious.  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes) and abdominal pain.
* **Kidney problems:** Rare, but serious.


**How it Works:**

Allopurinol works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, an enzyme involved in the production of uric acid. By blocking this enzyme, allopurinol reduces the amount of uric acid your body produces, thus lowering the levels in your blood. This helps to prevent the formation of uric acid crystals that cause gout attacks and kidney stones.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?**  It may take several weeks for allopurinol to significantly lower uric acid levels and reduce the frequency of gout attacks.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking allopurinol?** Alcohol can increase uric acid levels, so it's generally recommended to limit or avoid alcohol consumption while taking allopurinol.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double up on doses.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects, particularly a rash.
* **Is allopurinol right for me?**  This medication is prescribed by a doctor. Only your doctor can determine if it's appropriate for your specific situation based on your medical history and current health condition.  It's crucial to discuss any potential interactions with other medications you are taking.
* **Can I stop taking allopurinol suddenly?**  No, you should not stop taking allopurinol suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly may lead to a flare-up of gout symptoms.
