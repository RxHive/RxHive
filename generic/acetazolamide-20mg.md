# Acetazolamide 20mg

**Generic Name:** Acetazolamide

**Usage:**

Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor primarily used to treat:

* **Glaucoma:**  It reduces intraocular pressure (IOP) by decreasing aqueous humor production.  It's often used in combination with other glaucoma medications.
* **Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH):**  Also known as pseudotumor cerebri, it reduces intracranial pressure.
* **Altitude sickness (acute mountain sickness):** It helps prevent and treat symptoms like headache, nausea, and shortness of breath.
* **Epilepsy:**  It's sometimes used as an adjunctive therapy (alongside other anti-epileptic drugs) for certain types of seizures, particularly those involving absence seizures.
* **Metabolic alkalosis:**  It helps correct this electrolyte imbalance.
* **Periodic paralysis (in some cases):**  Though less common, it may be used to help manage certain forms of this condition.

**Important Note:** The usage of Acetazolamide should always be under the strict guidance of a physician.  This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Tingling in the extremities (paresthesia)
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Fatigue
* Metallic taste in the mouth
* Loss of appetite
* Kidney stones (in some cases)

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Severe allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing)
* Severe kidney problems
* Bone marrow suppression
* Pancreatitis
* Liver damage
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a rare, severe skin reaction)

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary depending on the individual and dosage.


**How it Works:**

Acetazolamide works by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.  Carbonic anhydrase plays a crucial role in the formation of aqueous humor in the eye and the production of bicarbonate in the kidneys. By inhibiting this enzyme, acetazolamide reduces the production of aqueous humor, lowering intraocular pressure.  It also affects the kidneys' ability to reabsorb sodium bicarbonate, which can help with managing some electrolyte imbalances.  Its mechanism of action in epilepsy and altitude sickness is less fully understood but is believed to be related to its effects on fluid balance and electrolyte levels.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Acetazolamide a diuretic?**  While it does have a mild diuretic effect, its primary mechanism isn't simply as a diuretic.  Its effect on fluid balance is a consequence of its carbonic anhydrase inhibition.

* **How long does it take to work?**  The onset of action varies depending on the condition being treated and the route of administration.

* **Can I take Acetazolamide with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking before starting Acetazolamide, as it can interact with certain drugs.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Follow your doctor's instructions regarding missed doses.  Generally, it's advised not to double up on doses.

* **Can I stop taking Acetazolamide suddenly?**  You should never stop taking Acetazolamide abruptly without consulting your doctor, as this can lead to withdrawal symptoms or worsening of the underlying condition.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Acetazolamide?**  Alcohol can worsen some of the side effects of Acetazolamide, such as dizziness and nausea.  It's best to avoid alcohol or limit consumption while taking this medication.
