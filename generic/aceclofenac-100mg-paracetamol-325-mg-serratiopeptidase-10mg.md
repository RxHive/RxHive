**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  A pain reliever and fever reducer.  Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.

* **Serratiopeptidase:** A proteolytic enzyme that helps break down proteins.  It's believed to reduce inflammation and swelling by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory process.  This can potentially help reduce pain and improve tissue healing.
