# Aceclofenac 100mg  + Paracetamol 4mg

It seems there's a mistake in the provided dosage.  Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is typically used at a much higher dose (325mg - 1000mg) than 4mg.  A combination of 4mg paracetamol with any other drug would be ineffective.  I will answer assuming the paracetamol dosage is a typo and should be 325mg or higher.

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac + Paracetamol (Acetaminophen)


**Usage:** This combination is used to relieve moderate to severe pain and inflammation. It's often prescribed for conditions like:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Post-surgical pain
* Post-traumatic pain
* Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea)
* Other painful inflammatory conditions


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, ulcers (rare but serious).  Aceclofenac is known to carry a higher risk of gastrointestinal issues than many other NSAIDs.
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling (especially of the face, lips, or tongue â€“ seek immediate medical attention if this occurs), difficulty breathing.
* **Other:**  Fluid retention, increased blood pressure, liver or kidney problems (rare but serious).


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).  Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is thought to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system, thus reducing pain and fever.  The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning the pain relief is greater than the sum of each drug alone.

It is generally not recommended during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, and use during breastfeeding should be carefully considered.
