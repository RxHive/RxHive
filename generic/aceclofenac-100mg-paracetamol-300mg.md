**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Belongs to a class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever and provides mild to moderate pain relief. Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides synergistic pain relief â€“ meaning the effect is greater than the sum of the individual components.  Aceclofenac tackles inflammation, while Paracetamol addresses pain and fever.
