**How it Works:** Abemaciclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 inhibitor.  These CDKs are enzymes involved in the cell cycle, specifically the progression from the G1 to S phase. By inhibiting these CDKs, abemaciclib slows or stops the growth of cancer cells that depend on these pathways for proliferation.  It is particularly effective in breast cancer cells that are driven by hormone receptors.
