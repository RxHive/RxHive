# Acetylcysteine 400mg/2ml

**Generic Name:** Acetylcysteine

**Usage:**  Acetylcysteine 400mg/2ml is primarily used for:

* **Treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose:** This is its most crucial application.  It works by replenishing glutathione, a vital antioxidant depleted by paracetamol toxicity, thus preventing liver damage.  Dosage and administration in this case are strictly determined by medical professionals based on the severity and timing of the overdose.
* **Mucolytic agent (loosening mucus):** It's used to thin and loosen thick mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up. This is helpful in conditions like bronchitis and cystic fibrosis.  However, its effectiveness as a mucolytic is debated and its use in this capacity is less common than its use in paracetamol overdose.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are relatively common, especially at higher doses.
* **Diarrhoea:**  Another gastrointestinal side effect.
* **Mouth sores:**  Irritation of the mouth and throat.
* **Rhinorrhea (runny nose):**  Especially when used as a mucolytic.
* **Bronchospasm:** In susceptible individuals, particularly those with asthma. This is a serious side effect and requires immediate medical attention.
* **Rare but serious side effects:**  Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction), and angioedema (swelling under the skin) are rare but potentially life-threatening possibilities.

**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol overdose:** Acetylcysteine acts as a precursor to glutathione, a crucial antioxidant.  Paracetamol overdose depletes glutathione, leading to liver damage.  Acetylcysteine replenishes this glutathione, preventing further liver damage.
* **Mucolytic:** Acetylcysteine breaks down disulfide bonds in mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel from the respiratory tract.  The exact mechanism of its mucolytic action isn't fully understood.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take acetylcysteine without a doctor's prescription?** A:  No.  Especially for paracetamol overdose, it requires immediate medical attention and precisely calculated dosages.  For mucolytic use, a doctor should assess the need and appropriate dosage.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects like nausea may resolve on their own.  However, if you experience severe side effects such as difficulty breathing, rash, or swelling, seek immediate medical attention.
* **Q:  Is acetylcysteine safe for everyone?** A:  No.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, individuals with certain allergies (e.g., to acetylcysteine), and those with specific medical conditions (e.g., severe asthma) may require special considerations or should avoid it.  Always consult a doctor before taking acetylcysteine.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking acetylcysteine?** A:  It is advisable to avoid alcohol, especially during treatment for paracetamol overdose, as alcohol can further stress the liver.  Consult your doctor for specific guidance.
* **Q: How is acetylcysteine administered?** A:  It can be administered intravenously (IV), orally (as tablets or granules), or by inhalation (as a nebulized solution). The method depends on the reason for its use and the severity of the condition.
