**How it Works:**

Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.  Paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). The exact mechanism of paracetamol's action isn't fully understood but is thought to involve blocking the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system. The combination provides a synergistic effect, meaning the two drugs work together to provide better pain and inflammation relief than either drug alone.
