**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Belongs to a class of drugs called NSAIDs. It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever and relieves pain, although the exact mechanism isn't fully understood.  It's thought to affect the way the brain responds to pain signals.
