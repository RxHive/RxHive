# Acebrophylline 10mg/5ml

**Generic Name:** Acebrophylline

**Usage:** Acebrophylline is a bronchodilator used to treat and prevent bronchospasm associated with reversible obstructive airway diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis.  It relaxes the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.  It's often used in conjunction with other asthma medications.  The specific dosage and frequency will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and response. A 10mg/5ml concentration suggests this is a liquid formulation, likely for pediatric or elderly patients needing easier administration.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, acebrophylline can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects can include:

* Headaches
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Upset stomach
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Restlessness
* Nervousness
* Tremors
* Palpitations (rapid heartbeat)
* Increased urination

More serious, but less common, side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Seizures
* Irregular heartbeat
* Severe low blood pressure


**How it Works:** Acebrophylline is a methylxanthine derivative.  It works by relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways of the lungs. This relaxation widens the airways, reducing resistance to airflow and making breathing easier.  The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's believed to involve the inhibition of phosphodiesterase, leading to increased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) which in turn promotes bronchodilation.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is acebrophylline a steroid?** A: No, acebrophylline is not a steroid. It's a bronchodilator that works differently than steroid medications used in asthma treatment.  Steroids reduce inflammation, while acebrophylline primarily relaxes the airway muscles.

* **Q: Can I take acebrophylline with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking before starting acebrophylline.  Interactions with other drugs are possible.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action can vary, but generally, you should start to feel some relief within a short time after taking it, although the full effect may take longer.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.

* **Q: Can I stop taking acebrophylline suddenly?** A:  No.  You should gradually reduce your dose under the guidance of your doctor before stopping completely. Sudden cessation can lead to worsening of symptoms.

* **Q:  Is acebrophylline safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A: The safety of acebrophylline during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not definitively established. Consult your doctor before taking it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
