# Aceclofenac 100mg  + Paracetamol 500mg  + Serratiopeptidase 500mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 500mg + Serratiopeptidase 500mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic pain and inflammation
* Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea)
* Back pain
* Toothache
* Other types of musculoskeletal pain


**It is crucial to note that this medication is not suitable for all conditions and should only be used as prescribed by a doctor.**  Self-medicating can be harmful.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person, but some common ones include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, indigestion.  More serious gastrointestinal issues like ulcers and bleeding are possible, though less common.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis â€“ seek immediate medical attention).
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness.
* **Liver and Kidney:**  Rare cases of liver and kidney damage have been reported.
* **Other:** Increased risk of bleeding, especially in individuals taking blood thinners.

This is not an exhaustive list, and more serious side effects are possible.  Consult a doctor if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals involved in pain and inflammation pathways.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** A pain reliever and fever reducer that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs, likely by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system.
* **Serratiopeptidase:** A proteolytic enzyme that helps break down proteins involved in inflammation and swelling.  It may also help reduce mucus viscosity, potentially providing some benefit in conditions involving inflammation and edema.


The combination of these three ingredients aims to provide a synergistic effect, offering broader pain relief and anti-inflammatory action than any single component alone.
