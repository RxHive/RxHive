# Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation (swelling) caused by various conditions such as:

* Osteoarthritis (pain and inflammation in the joints)
* Rheumatoid arthritis (a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints)
* Ankylosing spondylitis (inflammation of the spine)
* Post-surgical or post-traumatic pain
* Moderate to severe pain (e.g., headache, toothache, menstrual cramps)  *Note:  While it can treat these pains, it's crucial to understand this is a combination drug not ideal for regular or long term pain management. Consult a doctor for chronic pain solutions.*

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Indigestion
* Abdominal pain
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Rash
* Sleepiness

More serious, but less common, side effects include:

* Liver damage (jaundice, dark urine, pale stools)
* Kidney problems (reduced urine output, swelling in legs and ankles)
* Allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation (severe stomach pain, black stools, vomiting blood)
* Increased risk of heart attack or stroke (particularly with long-term use or high doses).

**It's crucial to seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these serious side effects.**

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's thought to work by affecting the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects of each drug. This allows for effective pain and inflammation relief with potentially lower doses of each individual component, reducing the risk of side effects.
