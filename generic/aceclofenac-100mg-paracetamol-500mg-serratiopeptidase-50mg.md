**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 500mg + Serratiopeptidase 50mg

**Note:**  This medication is not suitable for all types of pain.  Always consult a doctor to determine if this combination is appropriate for your specific condition.  The dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by your healthcare provider.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* Gastrointestinal problems:  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals responsible for pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  A pain reliever and fever reducer. Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.
* **Serratiopeptidase:** A proteolytic enzyme that helps to break down proteins involved in inflammation and swelling. This can lead to reduced pain and improved tissue healing.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take this medication with other drugs?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Interactions with other drugs, particularly blood thinners (anticoagulants) or other NSAIDs, are possible.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Alcohol can increase the risk of stomach upset and other side effects.  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.
* **What if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **How long should I take this medication?**  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Prolonged use of NSAIDs can increase the risk of side effects.
* **Who should not take this medication?**  People with certain medical conditions, such as severe liver or kidney disease, peptic ulcers, bleeding disorders, and allergies to any of the components, should generally avoid this medication.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should also consult their doctor before taking it.
