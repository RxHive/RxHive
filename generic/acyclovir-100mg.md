# Acyclovir 100mg

**Generic Name:** Acyclovir

**Usage:** Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat infections caused by herpes viruses, including:

* **Genital herpes (HSV-2):**  Reduces the frequency and severity of outbreaks.  Does *not* cure herpes.
* **Oral herpes (HSV-1):** Shortens the duration and severity of cold sores.
* **Shingles (herpes zoster):** Reduces the duration and severity of pain and rash.
* **Chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus):** Reduces the severity and duration of the illness, especially in immunocompromised individuals.
* **Herpes encephalitis (HSV-1):** A serious brain infection requiring immediate medical attention; acyclovir is a critical part of treatment.

It's crucial to note that acyclovir is a treatment, not a cure.  It manages symptoms and reduces the duration and severity of outbreaks, but the virus remains in the body.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Headache**
* **Nausea**
* **Vomiting**
* **Diarrhea**
* **Fatigue**
* **Rash**
* **Dizziness**

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **Kidney problems (especially with high doses):**  Increased risk in individuals with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Neurological problems:**  Confusion, tremors, seizures (rare, usually with high doses or impaired kidney function).
* **Blood disorders:**  Rare but serious.

**How it Works:** Acyclovir is a nucleoside analog.  This means it resembles a building block of DNA.  The herpes virus incorporates acyclovir into its DNA during replication.  This interferes with the virus's ability to replicate and spread, thus slowing down the infection.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take acyclovir to prevent outbreaks?** A:  While it can reduce the frequency of outbreaks in some cases, it's not typically used for solely preventative purposes.  Your doctor may prescribe it for suppressive therapy in certain situations, such as frequent or severe outbreaks.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  This depends on the infection and the dosage.  Relief from symptoms often begins within a few days, but the full course of treatment is usually several days to weeks.
* **Q: Can I take acyclovir with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Interactions with other drugs are possible.
* **Q: Is acyclovir safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** A:  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.  While generally considered safe in pregnancy, it's crucial to weigh the potential risks to the fetus against the benefits of treatment.  It can be passed through breast milk.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have concerns.
* **Q: Can I buy acyclovir over the counter?** A: In some countries, lower-strength formulations are available over-the-counter for treating cold sores.  Higher doses and treatments for more serious infections require a prescription.
