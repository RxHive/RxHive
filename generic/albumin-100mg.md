# Albumin 100mg

It's important to note that there is no "Albumin 100mg" generic medication.  Albumin is typically measured in grams (g), not milligrams (mg), and it's administered intravenously, not orally.  A 100mg dose would be exceptionally low and clinically irrelevant.  Albumin solutions come in various concentrations (e.g., 5%, 20%).  Therefore, the following information refers to *human albumin* in general, not a hypothetical "Albumin 100mg" product.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for specific dosage and administration information for any albumin product.

**Generic Name:** Human Albumin (sometimes called Albumin Human)

**Usage:**  Human albumin is used to treat conditions where there is a low level of albumin in the blood (hypoalbuminemia). This can be caused by various factors including:

* **Hypovolemic shock:**  Severe blood loss. Albumin helps to increase blood volume and maintain blood pressure.
* **Burns:**  Significant burns can lead to fluid loss and low albumin levels.
* **Liver disease:** The liver produces albumin, so liver damage can reduce albumin production.
* **Kidney disease:**  Kidney disease can lead to albumin loss in the urine.
* **Malnutrition:**  Insufficient protein intake can lead to low albumin levels.
* **Surgery:**  To help maintain blood volume during and after surgery.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally rare, but can include:

* **Allergic reactions:** These can range from mild (rash, itching) to severe (anaphylaxis â€“ a life-threatening allergic reaction).  This is a serious concern, and patients should be monitored closely after administration.
* **Fluid overload:**  This can occur if too much albumin is given, especially in patients with heart or kidney problems.  Symptoms can include shortness of breath, swelling in the legs and ankles.
* **Increased blood pressure:**  Due to increased blood volume.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Less common.
* **Fever:**  Less common.


**How it Works:** Albumin is a protein naturally found in the blood. Its main function is to maintain blood volume and oncotic pressure (the pressure that keeps fluid within the blood vessels). When albumin levels are low, fluid leaks from the blood vessels into surrounding tissues, leading to edema (swelling).  Administering albumin helps restore blood volume and oncotic pressure, pulling fluid back into the bloodstream.


**FAQs:**

* **Is albumin addictive?** No.
* **Can I take albumin orally?** No, albumin is given intravenously.  Oral administration is ineffective because it is digested like any other protein.
* **How long does albumin stay in the body?** The half-life of albumin is roughly 15-20 days, meaning about half the administered albumin is cleared from the body within that timeframe.  The actual duration depends on individual factors.
* **Are there any drug interactions?**  While generally well-tolerated, interactions are possible.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **What are the precautions?**  Pre-existing heart or kidney disease, dehydration and allergic reactions to albumin are all significant considerations before administration. Careful monitoring is essential.
