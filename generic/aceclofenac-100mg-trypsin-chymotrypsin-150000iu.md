# Aceclofenac 100mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 150000IU

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 100mg + Trypsin Chymotrypsin 150000IU

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue injuries.  The aceclofenac component provides pain relief and reduces inflammation, while the trypsin and chymotrypsin help reduce swelling and promote faster healing by breaking down proteins associated with inflammation and tissue damage.  It's crucial to note that this is not a first-line treatment for these conditions and should be used as directed by a physician.  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (in rare cases, a severe allergic reaction).
* **Central Nervous System effects:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness.
* **Other potential side effects:**  Increased risk of bleeding, liver or kidney problems (rare but serious).


This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary from person to person.  If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and consult your doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.

* **Trypsin and Chymotrypsin:** These are proteolytic enzymes (enzymes that break down proteins). They help reduce inflammation and swelling by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory process, promoting faster healing of damaged tissues.  The exact mechanism of their action in reducing pain is not fully understood but is thought to be related to their anti-inflammatory effects.
