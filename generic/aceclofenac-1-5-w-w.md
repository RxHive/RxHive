# Aceclofenac 1.5% w/w

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac

**Usage:**  Aceclofenac 1.5% w/w is a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with:

* **Musculoskeletal conditions:** Such as sprains, strains, bruises, and arthritis-related pain in joints and muscles.  The exact conditions it's approved for will vary by country and regulatory agency.  Always check the product labeling.

**Side Effects:**  As with all medications, aceclofenac can cause side effects, although they are generally mild and infrequent when applied topically.  However, it's crucial to note that even topical application can lead to systemic absorption, increasing the risk of systemic side effects. Possible side effects include:

* **Local skin reactions:**  Itching, redness, rash, burning, stinging at the application site.
* **Rare but more serious side effects (requiring immediate medical attention):**  Allergic reactions (including swelling of the face, lips, or tongue), severe skin reactions (like Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis), blistering.
* **Systemic side effects (less common but possible due to absorption):**  Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, heartburn, abdominal pain), headache, dizziness.


**How it Works:** Aceclofenac is a non-selective COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor.  Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that contribute to pain and inflammation. By inhibiting COX enzymes, aceclofenac reduces the production of prostaglandins, thereby lessening pain and swelling.  When applied topically, it primarily acts locally at the application site, though some absorption into the bloodstream can still occur.
