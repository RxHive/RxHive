# Aceclofenac 50mg + Paracetamol 325mg

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac 50mg + Paracetamol 325mg

* Ankylosing spondylitis (inflammation of the spine)

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list of side effects.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Belongs to a class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever and relieves mild to moderate pain, but its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood. It is thought to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects. Aceclofenac addresses the inflammatory component of pain, while paracetamol provides additional pain relief.
